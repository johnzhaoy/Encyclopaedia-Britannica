"Gothofred, Theodore, son of the former, was born at Geneva in 1580. As soon as he had .finished his studies, he went to Paris ; where he conformed to the Romish religion, and applied with indefatigable in¬ dustry to the study of history, that of France particu¬ larly, wherein he became very eminent, as appears by his works. In 1632, the king made him one of his historiographers, with a stipend of 3000 livres ; and, in 1636, he was sent to Cologne, to assist at the treaty of peace negociating there on the part of France, by the cardinal of Lyons. This treaty being removed to Munster, Gothofred was sent thither, where he drew up Memoirs on the subject; and continued in that city, in the king’s service, to his death in 1649. Princi“ pal work is his “ Account of the Ceremonial of the kings of France.” GOTTENBURG, or Gotheburg, a rich and strong town of West Gothland, in Sweden, with a good har¬ bour, at the mouth of the river Gothelba ; which is the best situated for foreign trade of any in Sweden, as it lies without the Sound. It occupies the site of an an¬ cient town, named Lodese, which was built by Gustavus Vasa ; and being endowed with considerable privileges, soon became the great emporium for the trade of the western provinces. Charles IX. when duke of Goth¬ land, having in 1604 laid the foundations of a new town in the island of Hisingen, at no great distance from Lo- dese, called Gotheborg (since corrupted into Gotten- burg'), in honour of his duchy ; upon his accession to the throne, he erected in his new town a trading company ; drew thither many foreigners, particularly the Dutch, to whom he allowed an exemption from all duties of export and import during 20 years; a corps of English and Vol. X. Part I. f GOT Scots troops under the command of William Stewart; Cotten- and granted to the Calvinists established therein the free Q0^tUjng’en< exercise of their religion, the first place in Sweden where this toleration was permitted. Ihe town being in 1611 reduced to ashes by the Danes, was rebuilt in the reign of Gustavus Adolphus in its present situation, and ob¬ tained a confirmation of its ancient rights, with the grant of several additional privileges.—It is built in a very sigular situation. At a small distance from the sea is a marshy plain, scarcely more than half a mile in breadth, watered by the rivers Gotha and Moldal, and almost entirely enclosed with high ridges of rocks, so bare and rugged, that they scarcely produce a single blade of grass, and exhibit as barren an appearance as the summits of the loftiest Alps. Gottenburg stands partly upon the ridges, and partly in the plain ; and is divided from these different situations into the Up¬ per and Lower Town. The latter is entirely level, in- , tersected by several canals in the manner of the Dutch towns; and its houses are all constructed upon piles ; the upper part hangs on the declivities ; and rows of buildings rise one above the other like the seats of an am¬ phitheatre. The whole is regularly fortified ; and its cir¬ cumference is near three miles, exclusive of the suburbs, called Haga, which lie toward the harbour. The streets are all uniformly straight: a few of the houses are of brick ; but the generality are constructed with wood painted red. The harbour is formed by two chains of rocks, and is about a quarter of a mile in breadth. Its entrance is defended by the fort of Newr Elfsborg, which stands upon a small rocky island, and contains a garrison of 250 men. There is at Gotten¬ burg a Royal Society of Sciences and Literature, upon the plan of that of Upsala.—Mr Coxe was informed by a merchant who had resided 22 years at Gottenburg, that, during that period, its population had increased considerably, and that it now contained about 30,000 inhabitants. This flourishing state is attributed to the extension of its commerce, particularly its East India Company, and the success of the herring-fishery. An English consul and several merchants of our nation reside at Gottenburg: and a chapel, with a regular chaplain, is appropriated to their use. E. Long.

"GOWER, John, one of our most ancient English poets, was contemporary with Chaucer, and his inti¬ mate friend. Of what family, or in what country lie was born, is uncertain.

"But one of the fullest testimonies to our purpose is given hy Quintilian, Declam. 301. Adisti mensam, says he, ad quam cum venire cotpimus, Deos invocamus; “ We approached the table (at supper together), and then invoked the gods.” The Jesuit Trigautius, in his very elegant and in¬ structive narrative of the Christian expedition of their missionaries into China, book i. p. 69. gives this ac¬ count of the people there in the particular now under consideration. “ Before they place themselves for partaking of an entertainment, the person who makes it sets a vessel, either of gold, or silver, or marble, or some such valuable material, in a charger full of wine, which he holds with both his hands, and then makes a low bow to the person of chief quality or character at the table. Then from the hall or dining-room, he goes into the porch or entry, where he again makes a very low bow, and turning his face to the south, pours out this wine upon the ground as a thankful oblation to the Lord of heaven. After this, repeat¬ ing his reverential obeisance, he returns into the hall,” &c",,CN,6,China,Asia
"Their celebrated historian Josephus, giving a detail of the rites and customs of the Essenes, who were con¬ fessedly the strictest and most pious professors of the Jewish religion, has this remarkable passage to the pre¬ sent purpose: “ The priest,” says he, “ begs a blessing before they presume to take any nourishment; and it is looked upon as a great sin to take or taste before.” Then follows the thanksgiving before meat: and “ when the meal,” proceeds he, “ is over, the priest prays again; and the company with him bless and praise God as their preserver, and the donor of their life and nourish¬ ment.” Philo, in his book De vita cantemplativa, gives an account of a body of men and women stricter than even the Essencs themselves. He distinguishes them by ] G R A no particular name, though his relation is very accurate Grace, and circumstantial ; namely, that on certain special v— occasions, before “ they took their meals, they placed themselves in a proper decent order; when, lilting up their hands and eyes to heaven, they prayed to God that he would be pleased to be propitious to them in the use of those his good creatures.” From the Hebrew ritual it appears, that the Jews had their hymns and psalms of thanksgiving, not only after eating their passover, but on a variety of other occasions, at and alter meals, and even between their several courses and dishes; as when the best of their wine was brought upon the table, or their aromatic confections, or the fruit of the garden, &c.

"CONJUNCTIONS-, by which name are distinguished all those CONNECTIVES WHICH ARE COM¬ MONLY EMPLOYED TO CONJOIN SENTENCES. These have been divided into two kinds, called And ‘CONJUNCTIVES, or those words which conjoin sentences and their meanings also 5 and DISJUNCTIVES, or those words which, at the same time that they conjoin sentences, disjoin their meanings. Each of these general divisions has-been again subdivided. The former into copulatives and continuatives, the latter into simple dis¬ junctives and adversative disjunctives. But the general division is absurd, and the subdivisions are useless. Conjunc- <[ tions never disjoin the meanings of sentences, nor have any other effect than to combine two or more simple sentences into one compound sentence. If those simple sentences be oi opposite meanings, before their combination, they will continue so after it, whatever conjunction be employed to unite them. In nature, DIFFERENT TRUTHS are connected, if they be connected at all, by different relations j and therefore when the sentences expressive of those truths are connected jti language, it must be by words significant of those NATURAL relations. Thus, 'Accidental addition is expressed by the conjunction and 5 as when we say, Lysippus was a statuary and Priscian was a grammarian.” "" The unexpected junction of contrary truths is expressed by but j as, “ Brutus was a patriot but Caesar was not.” The relation of an effect to its cause is expressed by because j as, “ Rome was enslaved because Caesar was ambitious.” The relation of an effect to a cause of which the existence is doubtful, by if j as, “ you will live happily if you live honestly.” The relation of a cause to its effect, by therefore j as, “ Caesar was ambitious therefore Rome was enslaved.” The idea of simple diversity is expressed by either and or ; as, “ either it is day or it is night.” Contrariety between two affirmations, which though each may be true by itself, cannot both be true at once, is expressed by unless j as, Troy will be taken unless the Palladium be preserved.” Coincidence of two affirmations apparently contrary to each other is expressed by although j as, “ Troy will be taken although Hector defend it.” PREPOSITIONS, or those connectives of which the common office is to conjoin words which refuse to coalesce j and this they can do only by signifying those relations BY WHICH THE things expressed by the united words are connected in nature. The words of men, like their first ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects j and therefore <! there can be no doubt but the original use of prepositions was to denote the various relations of body. Afterwards when men began to dicern with their intellect, they took those words which they found already made, prepositions as well as others, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual concep- tions. Prepositions therefore are either PROPER, or those which lite¬ rally denote the relations sub¬ sisting among the objects of sense. Such as Or The accidental junction of two things between which there is no necessary connection ; as, “ a house with a party wall.” The separation of two things which we should expect to find united ; as, “ a house without a roof, a man without hands.” The relation subsisting between any thing and that which supports it j as, “ the statue stands upon a pedestal.” The relations of higher and lower j as, “ the sun is risen above the hills To support uneasy steps over the burning marie :—The sun is set BELOW the hori¬ zon :—The shepherd reclines under the shade of a beech-tree.” The relation between any thing in motion and that in which it moves j as, “ the rays of light pass through the air.” The relation between any thing continued, whether motion or rest, and the point of its beginning 5 as, “ the rays of light proceed from the sun:— These figs came from Turkey -That lamp hangs FROM the ceiling.” The relation between any thing continued and the point to which it tends ; as, “ he is going to Italy :—He slept till morning.” The relation between an effect and its cause j as, “ I am sick of my husband and for my gallant.” Conjunctions and preposi¬ tions are indeed employed only to connect sentences and words ; but it may be doubted whether they be parts ofspeech distinct from nouns, verbs, and adjec¬ tives. -See Chap.

"The com- 12. In most languages, probably in all cultivated mon dm- lanmiages, grammarians distinguish the following parts sion of the r ° ‘^1 ’ tw- 1 • 1 nr*' parts of °‘ sPeech '• ry°unt pronoun, verb,participle, adverb, pre- speccli the position, conjunction. The Latin and English gramma- most pro- rians admit the interjection among the parts of speech, Pen although it is confessedly not necessary to the construc¬ tion of the sentence, being only thrown in to express the affection of the speaker : and in the Greek and English tongues there is the article prefixed to nouns, when they signify the common names of things, to point them out, and to show how far their signification extends. In the method of arrangement commonly followed in grammars, adjectives are classed with sub¬ stantives, and both are denominated nouns; but it is cer¬ tain that, when examined philosophically, an essential difference is discovered between the substantive and the adjective; and therefore some writers of eminence, when treating of this subject, have lately given the following classification of words which we shall adopt: The ARTICLE, NOUN, PRONOUN, VERB, PARTICIPLE, ADJEC¬ TIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION, INTER¬ JECTION. All these words are to be found in the En¬ glish language j and therefore we shall examine each 3 class, endeavour to ascertain its precise import, and show Noiln in what respects it differs from every other class. It is < ^ impossible to investigate the principles of grammar without confining the investigation in a great measure to some particular language from which the illustrations must be produced j and that we should prefer the E-ng- lish language for this purpose can excite no wonder, as it is a preference which to every tongue is due from those by whom it is spoken. We trust, however, that the principles which we shall establish will be found to apply universally ; and that our inquiry, though princi¬ pally illustrated from the English language, will be an inquiry into philosophical or universal grammar",Pen,"UK,IN,GR",6,"N/A,India,Greece","N/A,Asia,Europe"
"te ongin the sin- lar and G R A them therefore to the genus called animal; and this word belongs to every species of animals, and to each individual animal. The same classification is made both of artificial and abstract substances ; of each of which there are genera, species, and individuals. Thus in na¬ tural substances, animal, vegetable, and fossil, denote GENERA 5 man, horse, tree, metal, a SPECIES j and Alex¬ ander,Bucephalus,oak, gold, are individuals. In arti- ficialsubstances,edifice is a GENUS; house, church, tower, are species ; and the Vatican, St Paul's, and the Tower of London, are individuals. In abstract substances, motion and virtue are GENERA flight and temperance are species ; the flight of Mahomet and temperance in wine are individuals. By arranging substances in this manner, and giving a name to each genus and species, the nouns necessary to any language are com¬ paratively few and easily acquired : and when we meet with an object unknown to us, we have only to examine it with attention ; and comparing it with other objects, to refer it to the genus or species which it most nearly resembles. By this contrivance we supply the want of a proper name for the individual; and so far as the resemblance is complete between it and the species to which it is referred, and of which we have given it the name, we may converse and reason about it without danger of error: Whereas had each individual in na¬ ture a distinct and proper name, words would be innu¬ merable and incomprehensible j and to employ our la¬ bours in language, would be as idle as that study of numberless written symbols which has been attributed to the Chinese",London,"VA,GB,CN",6,"Holy See (Vatican City State),United Kingdom,China","N/A,Europe,Asia"
"16. But although number be a natural accident of nouns, it can only be considered as essential to those which denote genera or species. Thus we may have occasion to speak of one animal or of many animals, of one man or of many men ; and therefore the nouns ani¬ mal and man must be capable of expressingas well as unity. But this is not the case with respect to the proper names of individuals: for we can only say Xenophon, Aristotle, Plato, &c. in the singular; as, were any one of these names to assume a plural form, it would cease to-be proper name of an individual, and become the common name of a species. Of this, indeed, we have some examples in every language","Plato, Of","CO,TR",6,"Colombia,Turkey","South America,Asia"
"From this idea of the accusative, the reason is obvious why the object after the active verb is often put in that case j it is because the action is supposed to proceed from the agent to the patient. But the same thing happens with respect to the dative case, and for the same reason. Thus, Antonius lev sit Ciceronem, and Anto¬ nias nocuit Ciceroni, are expressions of the same import, and in each the action of hurting is conceived as pro¬ ceeding /row Antony to Cicero j which is finely illu¬ strated by the passive form of such expressions, where the procedure above mentioned is expressly marked by’ the preposition ah': Cicero nocetur, Cicero Iceditur ab An¬ tonio. It is therefore not true, that “ the accusative is that case, at least the otily case, which to an efficient nominative and a verb of action subjoins either the ef¬ fect or the passive subject j nor is the dative the. only case which is formed to express relatiorts tending to itself.” The only thing essential to these two cases is to denote the apposition ox junction of one object with an¬ other ; and this they do nearly, if not altogether, in the same manner, although from the custom of language they may not be indifferently subjoined to the same verb. ^ The Greek language has no ablative case : but in of the ab- the Latin, where it is used, it denotes concomitancy, orlative case, that one thing accompanies another. From this concomi¬ tancy we sometimes draw an inference, and sometimes not. For example, when it is said, Templum clamors petebant, clamour isrepresented concomitant with their going to the temple j and here no inference is drawn: but from the phrase palleo metu, although nothing more is expressed than that paleness is a concomitant of the fear, yet we instantly infer that it is also the effect of it. In most instances where the ablative is used, an inference is drawn, of which the foundation is some natural con¬ nection observed to subsist between the objects thus con¬ nected in language. When this inference is not meant to be drawn, the preposition is commonly added j as, in- Urfectus est cun gladio, “he was slain with a sword about him j” interfectus est gladio, “ he was slain with a sword as the instrument of his death.” 21 The remaining cases, which have not been noticed, Of the no- are the nominative and the vocative. These are in mostniinative instances alike in termination, which makes it probablea.nd v°ca- that they were originally one and the same case. Thetive case?3 foundation of this conjecture will appear from consi¬ dering the use to which each of these cases is applied","Antony, Cicero, Cicero, Of","US,FR,TR",6,"United States,France,Turkey","North America,Europe,Asia"
"This would indeed be agreeable to the truth of things, but we have already seen that it is altogether impractica¬ ble. Objects have therefore been classed into genera and species; and names given, not to each individual, but to each genus and species. By this contrivance of language, we are enabled to ascertain in some measure any indi¬ vidual that may occur, and of which we know not the proper name, only by referring it to the genus or species to which it belongs, and calling it by the general or specific name ; but as there is frequent occasion to di¬ stinguish individuals of the same species from one ano¬ ther, it became necessary to fail upon some expedient to mark this distinction. In many languages general and specific terms are modified and restricted by three orders of words j the article, the adjective, and the oblique cases of nouns. The cases of nouns we have already considered : the adjective will employ ours;tyan(j attention afterwards: at present our observations are of the a confined to the article ; a word so very necessary, tide* that without it or some equivalent invention men could not employ nouns to any of the purposes of life, or in¬ deed communicate their thoughts at all. As the busi¬ ness of articles is to enable us, upon occasion, to employ general terms to denote particular objects, they must be considered in combination with the general terms, as merely substitutes for proper names. They have, how- been commonly called definitives; because they 24 The net serve to define and ascertain any particular object, so as to distinguish it from the other objects of the general class to which it belongs, and, of course, to denote its individuality. Of words framed for this purpose, whe¬ ther they have by grammarians been termed articles or not, we know of no language that is wholly destitute",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"This is the explanation of the articles A and THE as given by the learned Mr Harris, and thus far what he says on the subject is certainly just; hut it is not true that the article THE always insinuates a pw/oMf ac¬ quaintance, or refers a present perception to a like perception already past.—I am in a room crowded with company, of which the greater part is to me totally unknown. I feel it difficult to breathe from the gross¬ ness of the inclosed atmosphere ; and looking towards the window, I see in it a person whom I never saw be¬ fore. I instantly send my compliments to the gentle* man in the window, and request, that, if it be not incon¬ venient, he will have the goodness to let into the room a little fresh air. Of this gentleman I have no previous acquaintance; my present perception of him is my pri¬ mary perception, and yet it would have been extremely improper to send my compliments, &c. to A gentleman in the window Again, there would he no impropriety in saying—“ A man whom I saw yesterday exhibiting a show to the rabble, was this morning committed to jail charged with the crime of housebreaking.” Not¬ withstanding the authority, therefore, of Mr Hands and his master Apollonius, we may venture to affirm, that it is not essential to the article A to respect a pri¬ mary perception, or to.the article THE to indicate a pre- established acquaintance. Such may indeed be the man¬ ner in which these words are most frequently used j hut we see that there are instances in which they may be used dillerently. What then, it may he asked, is the import of each article, and in what respects do they differ",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"30. As some of the above words admit of no article, because they are by nature as definite as may be; so there are others which admit it not, because they are not to be defined at all. Of this sort are all interroga- TIVES. If we question about substances, we cannot say, THE WHO is THIS, hut who is this P And the same as to qualities and both quantities: for we say, without an article, WHAT SORT OF, HOW MANY, HOW GREAT ? The reason is, the article THE respects beings of which we can predicate something : hut interrogatives respect beings about which we are ignorant, and of which we can therefore predicate nothing; for as to what we know, interrogation is superfluous. In a word, the natural as- With whf sociators with articles are all THOSE common afpel-words th< LATIVES WHICH DENOTE THE SEVERAL GENERA ANDnatnrally SPECIES OF beings: and it may be questioned whe-associate‘ ther, in strictness of speech, they are ever associated with any other words",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"Now if a relative clause expresses that which might be expressed by an adjective, the presumption is, that it may be resolved into the same constituent parts.

Of this enumera¬ tion we can by no means approve 5 for, without enter¬ ing into a minute examination of it, nothing can be move obvious, than that his inceptive present—I am going to write—is a future tense ; and his com¬ pletive present—Ihavewritten—a past tense. But, as was before observed of the classification of words, we cannot help being of opinion, that, to take the te?ises as they are commonly received, and endeavour to as¬ certain their nature and their differences, is a much more useful exercise, as well as more proper for a work of 3 M A R",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

"But besides this relation of contradistinctum subsisting among the tenses, there is another of co-existence, as we may call it, to which it is of great consequence to attend -—especially in examining the nature of \\w present. 66 63. The PRESENT TENSE refers not only to something Of the pre- vvbich is past or future, but also to something with seat lensc* which the attribute or action of the verb is contempo¬ rary. This reference is necessarily implied in its very name ; for we cannot say of any thing that it is present, without implying at the same time that there is some¬ thing else with which it is present. Hence it appears with how little reason Mr Harris and others have given us an aorist of the present, as marking present time in¬ definitely in contradistinction to OTHER presents, which have been called inceptive, extended, and completive pre¬ sents. For from what has been said it follows, that the present tense is necessarily and from its very nature per¬ fectly indefinite, and can of itself give notice of no pre¬ cise or determinate portion or point of time whatever. A thing may have been present fifty years ago, may be pre¬ sent now, or at A\\y future period. This tense implies th e relation of co existence between two or more things j but, without some auxiliary circumstance, it cannot in any language mark the particular portion of time n\ which those things orA/. The indefinite nature of this tense is indeed most clearly seen in that use of It in which Mr Harris has styled it the aorist of the present; that is, in cases where it is employed to denote the repetition of an action whichthe agent is accustomedfrequent/ytoperform, or to express propositions of which the truth is evinced by general experience ; as in the following examples : “ Hypocrisy———the only evil that walks “ Invisible, except to God alone.” “ Ad pocnitendam properat qui cito judicatf &c",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"If we join two prcctcr-imperjects together, the expres¬ sion will state the co-existence of two progressive ac¬ tions, both of which were going on at a. time past in re¬ spect of some determinate time given or supposed. “ Cum tu scribebas ego legebam 5” ” when you were writing I was reading.” Hence the prteter-imperfect has by some grammarians been called the relative present ; a name which, however, is by no means exclusively appli¬ cable to this tense. WThen theprceter-imperfect is by the conjunction and joined in the same sentence with a plusquam perfect, the two tenses express two actions, both prior to the time of speaking y but the one as having continued after the other was finished. Thus, Eneas speaking of the destruction of Troy, says, that after ha¬ ving escaped with his father and followers, he returned to the city in quest of his wife, and went directly to his own house; but there, continues he, “ irruerant Danai, et tectum omne tenebant the Greeks had rushed inf that action was over and completed before his ar- rivalj but the act of ” possessing the whole house,” te- nebant, was not over, but still continuing. <55 65.

For this pur- ter""Per pose, Greek and English verbs have an aorist, a prater- perfect, and a plusquam perfect. Of these the Latin has only the two last. The prceter-pcrfect in that language sustains a twofold character : it performs the office of the Greek and English aorist, as well as of the preeter- perfect properly so called ; that is, it denotes a finished action at some indefinite past time, as well as at some time which is both past and definite","Troy, Of","GR,UK,US,TR",6,"Greece,N/A,United States,Turkey","Europe,N/A,North America,Asia"
"The aorist, then, we conceive to state an action as per¬ formed and finished in some past portion of time ; whilst the preeter-perfect represents the past perfoi'mance and completion of that action as now possessed. And here we may hazard a conjecture why have, when used as an auxiliary verb, is always joined with a past participle ; whereas did is joined to a word expressing the simple action of the verb, or, as it is called, present infini¬ tive. Of the expression, “ I have written a letter,” as one part, viz. the verb have, denotes time ; the other part, viz. WRITTEN, must denote past time, to give notice that the action is performed and finished. Did, on the other hand, implyingtime, has no occasion for the past part of another verb to give notice of this circumstance *, for “ I did write a letter,” is equiva¬ lent to, M at some past time I performed and finished the simple action of writing a letter.” Vol. X.

"Of modes in general something must be said here¬ after ) at present we shall only observe, that the mode wi h which we are now concerned, is not very properly distinguished by the name assigned to it by the Latin grammarians. They call it the subjunctive, because it is often subjoined to another verb, and forms the se¬ condary clause of a sentence : hut the mode called in- dicative frequently appears in the same circumstances",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

"Thirdly, The present of the subjunctive is often used to signify command or request; as when one says, “ ""V ou tnay give my compliments to such a person.” '1 his use he speaks has liberty or power assertion, however, may contain no new information ; and therefore the person addressed, reflecting upon the intention of the speaker in making it, infers that it in¬ dicates a wish or desire that “ his compliments should 7 . be made to such a person.’'’ ue pise- 70. Of the subjunctive as well as of the indicative, the r-imper- prceter-imperfect is evidently the past time of the present",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"From the near affinity which the present of the sub¬ junctive has to the future of the indicative, the tense now under consideration appears, in many instances, as the past time of the latter as well as the former. Thus Dixi me facturum quae imperaret, may he rendered “ I said that I would do whatever he might, or whatever he s/wrv/r/, command.” heVne- 71. Of the preeter perfect, it is sufficient to observe, i-perkct. that as the present states the agent as at liberty to be performing an unfinished action ; so this tense states him as at liberty to perform the action considered as finish¬ ed. “ 1 may be writing a letter when you come, i. e",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"I am at liberty to be writing a letter when you come.” I may have written a letter when you come,” i. e. I am at liberty to be in possession of the finished action of writing a letter when you come.” It is a common mode of expression to say, “ I may have done such or such a thing in my time,” when he who speaks can have little doubt whether he has done the thing or not. In that case, the words may have done, cannot be considered as the preeter-perfeet of ei fuisse si rogassem “ You promised that you would write, if I should have asked you.” Here the futurity of the action of asking, which is represented as complete and finished, is stated as co existing with the past pro¬ mise ; but the action itself must be posterior to that pro¬ mise: it is however supposed to be past with respect to theactiopoftor/ViM#, which isalsoposterior tothe promise. 77 73. Before we dismiss the subject of tenses, it may Of number not be improper just to mention number ani[ person; forand Peri>0B‘ these have place in every tense of the verb in the learn¬ ed languages, and in many tenses even of the English verb. They cannot, however, be deemed essential to the verb ; for affirmation is the same, whether it be made by you, by me, or by a third person, or whether it be made by one man or by a thousand. The most that can be said is, that verbs in the more elegant languages are provided with a variety of terminations which re¬ spect the number and person of every substantive, that we may know with more precision, in a complex sen¬ tence, each particular substance with its attendant verbal attributes. The same may be said of sex with respect to adjectives. They have terminations which vary as they respect beings male or female, though it is past dispute that substances alone are susceptible of sex. We therefore pass over these matters, and all of like kind, as being rather among the elegancies of particular lan¬ guages, and therefore to be learned from the particular grammar of each ton«ue, than among the essentials of language ; which essentials alone are the subject of in¬ quiry iu a treatise on grammar. 7s 74.

"Of this the learned author, indeed, seems to have been aware, when he observed of the subjunctive mode, that it is employed “ when we do not strictly assert,” and that “it implies but a dubious and assertion.” The Chap, IV, truth is, that the assertion implied in this mode, though Vnbs",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

The affirmation, however, alone is essential to the verb, for the attribute may be expressed by other words. It is indeed extremely probable, that, in the earliest ages of the world, the affir¬ mation and attribute were always expressed by different words ; and that afterwards, for the sake of conciseness, one word, compounded perhaps of these two, was made ta express both the affirmation and the attribute : hence arose the various classes of verbs, active, passive, and neuter. Of a process of this kind there are evident signs in the Greek and some other tongues. But the improvers of language stopped not here. The same love of con¬ ciseness induced them to modify the compound verb itself, that it might express various combinations of thought still more complex : but in all these combinations assertion was of necessity included j for if the word had ceased to assert, it would have ceased to be a verb of any kind",Of,"TR,GR",6,"Turkey,Greece","Asia,Europe"

"Of this there cannot be a clearer proof than the well- known fact, that we are obliged to express by the same mood very different modifications or energies gf thought. As, for instance, in the case of the gram¬ matical mood called the imperative, by which we ex¬ press occasionally prayer to God, command to a slave, request to a superior, advice to an equal or to any one, order as from an officer to his subaltern, supplication to one whom we cannot resist.”—If these be, as the author calls them, specific differences of thought, he will not surely object to their being all ranked under one genus, which may he called desire (x). That the internal feelings, which prompt us to pray to God, to command a slave, to request a superior, to advise an equal, to give an order to an inferior, and to suppli¬ cate one whom we cannot resist, are all different in de¬ gree, cannot he denied. Each of them, however, is desire; and the predication, by which the desire is made known to the person whom we address, is the same in all, when we utter a prayer as when we utter a com¬ mand, when we request as when we supplicate. But predication alone is that which constitutes the verb: for desire by itself, however modified, can be expressed only by an abstract noun; and the mere energy of desire, when not applied to a particular energiser, can be expressed only by a participle, or by what is commonly, though improperly, called the infinitive mode. Now it is cer¬ tainly conceivable, that a few shades of meaning, or a few (y) degrees of one general energy, might be marked by GRAMMAR",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"!,y corresponding variations of such verbs as combine energy with predication; and there could be no great impropriety in calling those variations modes, or rather modes of modes: but that such a multiplication of modes would be an improvement in language, is by no means evident. The verb, with the modes and tenses which it has in all languages, is already a very complex part of speech 5 which few are able, and still fewer inclined, to analyze : and it would surely be of no advantage to make it more complex by the introduction of new modes, especially when those degrees of energy which could be marked by them are with equal and perhaps greater precision marked, in the living speech, by the different tones of voice adapted to them by nature 5 and, in written language, by the reader’s general know¬ ledge of the subject and of the persons who may be occasionally introduced. If there be any particular delicacy of sentiment, or energy, which cannot thus be made known, it is better to express it by a name appropriated to itself, together with the simple and ori¬ ginal veib of affirmation, than to clog the compound verb with such a multiplicity of variations as would render the acquisition of every language as difficult as is said to be that of the Chinese written characters",,CN,6,China,Asia
"rerbs,«s g0< Having considered the verb in its essence, its ten- r are ses, and its modes, we might seem to have exhausted the 0’rl subject; but there is still something more to he done, ter. Grammarians have distinguished verbs into several spe¬ cies : and it remains with us to inquire upon what prin¬ ciple in nature this distinction is made, and how far it proceeds. Now it must be obvious, that if predication be the essence of verbs, all verbs, as such, must be of the same species; {ov predication is the same in every pro¬ position, under every possible circumstance, and by whom¬ soever it is made. But the greater part of verbs con¬ tain the predicate as well as the predication of a pro¬ position ; or, to speak in common language, they denote an attribute as well as an affirmation. Thus, lego is '■ “ I am reading f ambulo, “ I am walking sto, “ I am standingverbero, “ I am strikingverberor, “ I am stricken."" But the attributes expressed by these verbs are evidently of difierent kinds; some consisting in action, some in suffering, and some in a state of being which is neither active nor passive. Hence the distinc¬ tion of verbs, according to,the attributes which they de¬ note, into active, passive, and neuter. Lego, which is an assertion that I am employed in the act of reading, is an active verb ; verberor, which is an assertion that I am suffering under the rod, is a passive verb, because it denotes a passion ; and sto, which is an assertion that I am standing still, is said to be a neuter verb, because it denotes neither action nor passion. But it is self-evident that there cannot be action without an agent, r\ovpassion without by means of it, may he expressed in synonymous and convertible phrases, in different languages, by means of other parts or moods of the verb.” Of these synonymous and convertible phrases he gives several examples, of which the first is taken from Hamlet’s soliloquy. “ To be or not to be, that is the question,” he thinks equivalent in meaning to, “ The question is, whether we shall be or shall not be .2” But we are persuaded he is mistaken. “ Whether we shall be or shall not be,” is a question asking, whether we shall exist at some future and indefinite time? but the subject of Hamlet’s debate with himself was not. Whether, if his conscious existence should be interrupted, it would be afterwards at some future and indefinite time restored? but whether it was to continue uninterrupted by his exit from this world ? This, we think, must be self-evident to every reader of the Soliloquy. It is likewise very obvious, that the word question in this sentence does not signify interrogatory, but subject of debate or affair to be examined; and that the word that serves for no other purpose than to complete the verse, and give additional emphasis, perhaps, to an inquiry so important. “ To be or not to be, that is the question,” is therefore equivalent in all respects to “ The continuance or non-continuance of my existence, is the matter to be examined ;” and the infinitive is here indisputably used as an abstract noun in the nominative case",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"^ ith the same view, to prove the infinitive to be truly a verb, the Doctor proceeds to remark upon the fol¬ lowing phrases, Dico, credo, puto, Titium existere, valere,jacere, cecidisse, procubuisse, projecisse Mcevium, pro¬ ject umfuisse a Mcevio ; which, he says, have the very same meaning with dico, &c. quod Titius existat, quodjaceat, quod cecident, &c. He adds, that “ the infinitives, as thus used, acquire not any further meaning, in addition to the radical import of the verb with tense, like the proper moods ; but the subjunctives after quod lose their peculiar meaning as moods, and signify no more than bare infinitives."" In the sense in which this observation is made by the author, the very reverse of it seems to be the truth. The infinitives, as thus used, acquire, at least in the mind of the reader, something like the power of affirmation, which they certainly have not when standing by themselves ; whereas, the subjunctives neither lose nor acquire any meaning by being placed after quod. Dico, credo, puto, Titium existere, valere,jacere, &c. when translated literally, signify, I say, believe, think, Titius to exist, to be well, to lie along; a mode of speaking which, though now not elegant, was common with the best writers in the days of Shakespeare, and is frequently to be found in the writings of Warburton at the present day. Dico, credo, puto, quod Titius existat, quodjaceat, &c. signifies literally, 1 say, believe, think, that Titius may exist, may lie along, &e. Remove the verbs in the indicative mode from the former set of phrases, and it will be found that the infinitives had acquired a meaning, when conjoined with them, which they have not when left by themselves: for Titium existere, jacere ; “ Titius to exist, to lie along,” have no complete meaning, because they ajfrm nothing. On the other hand, when the indicative verbs are removed, together with the won¬ der-working quod, from the latter set of phrases, the meaning of the subjunctives remains in all respects as it was before the removal; for Titius existat, jaceut, &c. signify, Titius may exist, may lie along, as well when they stand by themselves as when they make the final clauses of a compound sentence. Every one knows that quod, though often called a conjunction, is always in fact the relative pronoun. Dico, credo, puto, quod Titius existat, must therefore be construed thus : Titius existat [est id) quod dico, credo, &c. “Titius may exist is that thing, that proposition, which I say, believe, think.” In the former set of phrases, the infinitives are used as abstract nouns in the accusative case, denoting, in conjunction with Titium, one complex conception, the existence, &c",Warburton,PK,6,Pakistan,Asia
"Of the truth of his assertion respecting past participles, he gives a Greek and a Latin example. The former is taken from St Mark : 0 Tnnvtrxs <rwl)no-{]xi; and the /aMer is that which is commonly called the perfect future of the passive verb amor, amatus fuero. In the first in¬ stance, be says that the participle, though belonging to the aorist of the past time, must be rendered either by the indefinite present, “ be who believeth ;"" or by the future, “ he who to///believe and the reason which he gives for this rendering of the word is, that “ the be¬ lieving here spoken of is considered as posterior in time to the enunciation oi the promise."" This is indeed true, but it is not to the purpose; for with the enunciation of the promise, the time of the participle has no manner of concern. The time of TrufUvrxi depends entirely upon the time of vu^a-irxi, with respect to which it must undeniably he past. Our Lord is not here asserting, that he who shall believe at the day of final retribution, shall be saved; but that be who shall on that day be found to have believed in time past, shall be saved : and if the participle had not been expressive of n.finished action and a past time, the whole sentence would have convey¬ ed a meaning not friendly to the interests of the gospel",Of,"TR,GR",6,"Turkey,Greece","Asia,Europe"

"(m) Of the causal conjunctions mentioned in the text, recause has been already considered ; and some account must be given of the two words SINCE and AS. The former of these, according to Mr H. Tooke, is a very cor¬ rupt abbreviation, confounding together different words and different combinations of words. To us it appears to be compounded of seand, seeing ; and ES, that or it; or of SIN, seen, and ES. Seand and sin are the present and past participles of the Anglo-Saxon verb SEON, to see. In modern English SINCE is used four ways ; two as a preposition affecting words, and two as a conjunction affecting sentences. W hen used as a proposition, it has always the signification of the past participle SEEN joined to thence (i. e. seen and thenceforward'), or else the signification of the past participle seen only. When used as a conjunction, it has sometimes the signification of the present participle SEEING, or seeing that; and sometimes the signification of the past participle SEEN, or SEEN THAT. Wfe shall give examples of all these significations. 1st. As a preposition signifying seen and thence¬ forward: “ A more amiable sovereign than George HI. has not swayed the English sceptre since the conquesti‘'> That is, “ The conquest seen (or at the completion of the sight of the conquest), and thenceforward, a more ami¬ able sovereign than George III. has not swayed the English sceptre.” Since, taken in this sense, seems rather to be a corruption of siththan or sithence, than a compound of SEAND and ES. 2dly, As a preposition signi¬ fying SEEN simply : Hid George III. reign before or SINCE that example ? 3dly, As a conjunction, SINCE means seeing that: as, “ If I should labour for any other satisfaction but that of my own mind, it would be an effect of phrenzy in me, not of hope ; SINCE (or seeing that) it is not truth but opinion that can travel through the world without a passport.” 4thly, It means seen that or that seen ; as, “ Since death in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one, it were a foolish madness in the shipwreck of worldly things, when all sinks but the sorrow, to save that ;” i. e.—Heath in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one ; THAT SEEN, it were a foolish madness,” &,c","Of, George, George","UK,ZA,TR",6,"N/A,South Africa,Turkey","N/A,Africa,Asia"

"(n) As Mr Harris has called THEREFORE, wherefore, &c. collective conjunctions, we have retained the tie- nomination, though perhaps a more proper might be found. It is indeed of little consequence by what name any class of words be called, provided the import of the words themselves be understood. Wherefore and THERE¬ FORE evidently denote the relation of a cause to its effects. They are compounds of the Saxon words HW,er and THAiR with FOR or VOOR: and signify, /or which, for those, or that. It is worthy of remark, that in some parts of Scotland the common people even at this day use THIS for these.^ . ... -r » j c (o) We have already considered the word that, and seen that it is never a conjunction, but unnormly a defi¬ nite article. “ The trumpet sounds (for) that it may raise our courage j” taking the clause it may raise our courage as an abstract noun in concord with that and governed hy for.

"(p) Mr Horne Tooke has favoured us with some ingenious remarks on the two different derivations o. the word BUT, when used in the two acceptations that are usually annexed to it, viz. that which it bears in the beginning of a sentence, and that which it has in the middle. He has given it as his opinion, that this word, when employ¬ ed in the former way, is corruptly put for BOT, the imperative of the Saxon verb botan, to boot, to superadd, to supply, &c. and that when used in the latter it is a contraction of be-utan, the imperative of BEONUPAN, to be out. Our ancient writers made the proper distinction between the orthography of the one word and that of the other. Gawin Douglass, in particular, although he frequently confounds the two words, and uses them im¬ properly, does yet abound with many instances of their proper use ; and so contrasted, as to awaken, says our author, the most inattentive reader.

But where speech can be employed, they are totally useless ; and are always in¬ sufficient for the purpose of communicating thought. Dr Beattie ranks strange, prodigious, amazing, wonderful, O dear,dear me, fkc.when used alone, and without appa¬ rent grammatical syntax, among the interjections: but he might with as much propriety have considered hardly, truly, really, and even many Latin verbs, as interjections ; for these two are often used alone, to supply the place of whole sentences. The truth is, that all men, when suddenly and violently agitated, have a strong ten¬ dency to shorten their discourse by employing a single word to express a sentiment. In such cases, the word employed, whether noun, adjective, or verb, would be the. principal word of the sentence, if that sentence were completed $ and the agitation of the speaker is such, and the cause of it so obvious, that the hearer is in no danger of mistaking the sense, and can himself supply the words that are wanting. Thus if a person, after listening to a romantic narrative, were to exclaim, strange! would any man of common sense suppose, that the word strange, because uttered alone, had lost the power of an adjective and become an interjection 9 No, surely : Every one sees, that the exclamation is equivalent to, That is strange, or That is a strange story. Real interjections are never employed to convey truth of any kind. They are not to be found amongst laws, in books of civil institutions, in history, or in any treatise of useful arts or sciences ; but in rhetoric and poetry, in novels, plays, and romances,wheve in English, so far from giving pathos to the style, they have gene¬ rally an effect that is disgusting or ridiculous",Of,"TR,UK",6,"Turkey,N/A","Asia,N/A"

"The Moors have left more monuments in Granada than in any other city in Spain. From the great num¬ ber of inscriptions in and about the city, and the fine edifices of the Alhambra and the Generalif, it might be supposed these people intended to make Granada the greatest depository of their religion, manners, cu¬ stoms, and magnificence. There is not a wall which does not bear some marks of their power $ but, not¬ withstanding this abundance of monuments, the reign of the Moors in Spain is still buried in confusion and obscurity. The ignorance of the Spaniards, their su¬ perstition, and the hatred they bore the Moors, have much contributed to this darkness-, they have either destroyed, or suffered to be eftaced by time, every thing which bore the mark of Mahometanism, instead of preserving the monuments of antiquity, which at the same time were those of their own glory j and it may be said, that chance alone, and the solidity of their con¬ struction, much more than curiosity or a love of the arts, has preserved those which still exist, though daily going to ruin. - An account of the Alhambra has been already gi¬ ven under its name in the order of the alphabet. From the hall of Comares there mentioned, there is a modern little staircase the old one, which corresponded to the beauty of the edifice, having been destroyed. At the top of the staircase is a gallery, a part of which is in¬ closed with an iron railing : this kind of cage is called the prison of the queen. It was here the wife of the last king of Granada was imprisoned. The Gomels and Legris, two families of distinction, bore false wit¬ ness against her virtue, and occasioned the destruc¬ tion of the greatest part of the Abencerrages, another 64 ] G R A powerful and numerous family of Granada of whom they were jealous. The history of this event is given as follows : In the year 1491, Abdali, surnamed the Little, still reigned in Granada j but this city was upon the brink of ruin, for the principal families were divided against each other. The Moors had carried their arms against Jaen, and had been bravely repulsed. Abdali was con¬ soling himself in one of his pleasure houses for the ill success of his enterprise, when the Zegris, who long had been the secret enemies of the Abencerrages, took the opportunity of this defeat to represent them to the king as rebellious subjects, who employed their immense riches to gain the favour of the people and dethrone their sovereign. They accused Albin Ha- met, the most rich and powerful among them, of ha¬ ving an adulterous commerce with the queen, and pro¬ duced witnesses who asserted they had on a certain fe¬ stival seen, at Generalif, under a bower of rose trees, Albin Hamet in the arms of that princess. The fury of Abdali may easily be imagined j he swore the de¬ struction of the Abencerrages. But the Zegris, too prudent to let his anger break forth, advised him to dissimulate, and not to suffer it to be known to that numerous and powerful family that he was informed of their perfidy. It will be better, said they, to entice them into the snare, and, before they can unite and put themselves into a state of defence, revenge upon their heads the insult offered to the crown. This ad¬ vice was followed ; Abdali went to the Alhambra, having ordered thirty of his guards to arm themselves, and the executioner to attend. The Abencerrages were sent for one by one, and beheaded as soon as they entered the hall of the lions, where there is still a large vase of alabaster,"" which was quickly filled with blood and the heads of expiring bodies. Thirty-five heads had already been struck off, and all the Abencerrages would have died in the same manner, had not a page, who had followed his master, and remained unpercei¬ ved in the hurry of the execution, taken an opportu¬ nity of withdrawing and giving information to the rest of the unhappy family of what had passed. These im¬ mediately assembled their friends in arms, crying out through the city of Granada, “ Treason ! treason ! Let the king die ! he unjustly puts to death the Aben¬ cerrages ! ’ The people, with whom they were favou¬ rites, did not hesitate in assisting them : fourteen thou¬ sand men were soon found in arms, and immediately proceeded towards the Alhambra, shouting all the ™ay> L,et ^ie k*ng die ! Abdali, surprised his secret should have been so soon discovered, and severely re¬ penting of having followed the pernicious counsels he had received, ordered the castle gates to be shut; but they were presently set on fire. Muley Hacen, who had ieen forced to abdicate the throne in favour of his son, hearing the tumult of the people, had one gate open¬ ed and presented himself to appease the rage of the citizeno j but he no sooner appeared, than he was lift- ‘^B1! bu he m.U!tltude ncarest gate, who cried out, Behotd our king, we will have no other, long live “neJ Ha?nA IeavinS llira surroundedSby a te.edgHS d,il he AbenCe,?a£es’ and other fiobles, en- drlT th1e,.castle’ accoi«Pan‘ed by upwards of an hun¬ dred soldiers.

"In this last, or insect state, they eat little, their prin¬ cipal business being to deposit their ova (eggs), which unerring instinct prompts them to do wheie large col¬ lections of grain furnish food for their successors while in a vermicular state. It is therefore the business of industry to prevent future generations of these ravagers, by destroying the eggs previous to their hatching ; and e G R A [ 68 ] G R A this is best accomplished by frequent screening, and ex¬ posure to draughts of wind or fresh air. By frequent¬ ly stirring the grain, the cohesion of their ova is bro¬ ken, and the nidus of those minute worms is destroyed, which on hatching collect together, and spin or weave numerous nests of a cob-web like substance for their security. To these nests they attach, by an affinity of small threads, many grains of corn together, first for their protection, and then for their food. When their habitations are broken and separated by the screen, they fall through its small interstices, and may be easi¬ ly removed from the granary with the dust. Those that escape an early screening will be destroyed by subse¬ quent ones, while the grain is but little injured ; and the corn will acquire thereby a superior purity. But by inattention to this, and sometimes by receiving grain already infected into the granary, these vermin, parti¬ cularly the weevil, will in a short time spread themselves in that state everywhere upon its surface, and darken even the walls by their number. Under such circum¬ stances, a hen or hens, with new hatched chickens, if turned on the heap, will traverse, without feeding (or very sparingly so) on the corn, wherever they spread ; and are seemingly insatiable in the pursuit of these in¬ sects. When the numbers are reduced within reach, a hen will fly up against the walls, and brush them down with her wdngs, while her chickens seize them with the greatest avidity. This being repeated as often as they want food, the whole species will in a day or two be destroyed. Of the phalaena (moth), and the small beetle, they seem equally voracious : on which account they may be deemed the most useful instruments in nature for eradicating these noxious and destructive vermin.

"A remark is made above, that the emotions of gran¬ deur and sublimity are nearly allied. And hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the other : an increasing series of numbers, for example, producing an emotion similar to that of mounting upward, is com¬ monly termed an ascending series : a series of numbers gradually decreasing, producing an emotion similar to that of going downward, is commonly termed a descend¬ ing series: we talk familiarly of going vp to the capital, and of going down to the country : from a lesser king¬ dom we talk of going up to a greater 5 whence the ana¬ basis in the Greek language, when one travels from Greece to Persia. We discover the same way of speak¬ ing in the language even of Japan $ and its universali¬ ty proves it the offspring of a natural feeling. 6 The foregoing observation leads us to considerGr»n( grandeur and sublimity in a figurative sense, and asaIld,i applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto these ternisj11^' have been taken in their proper sense as applicable to sense, objects of sight only : and it was of importance to be¬ stow some pains upon that article; because, generally speaking, the figurative sense of a word is derived from its proper sense, which bolds remarkably at present",,"GR,JP",6,"Greece,Japan","Europe,Asia"
"Such is the resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur, that among the nations on the east coast of Africa, who are directed purely by nature, the officers of state are, with respect to rank, distinguished by the length of the batoon each carries in his hand j and in Japan, princes and great lords show their rank by the length and size of their sedan-poles. Again, it is a rule in painting, that figures of a small size are proper for grotesque pieces : but that an historical sub¬ ject, grand and important, requires figures as great as the life. The resemblance of these feelings is in rea¬ lity so strong, that elevation in a figurative sense is ob¬ served to have the same effect, even externally, with real elevation",,JP,6,Japan,Asia
"As, on the one hand, no means directly applied have more influence to raise the mind than grandeur and sublimity ; so, on the other, no means indirectly applied have more influence to sink and depress it: for in a state of elevation, the artful introduction of an humbling object, makes the fall great in proportion to the elevation. Of this observation Shakespeare gives a beautiful example in the passage last quoted ] G R A The cloud-capt tow’rs, tbe gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And like the baseless fabric of a vision Leave not a wreck behind Tempest, act iv. sc. 4* The elevation of the mind in the former part of this beautiful passage, makes the fall great in proportion, when the most humbling of all images is introduced, that of an utter dissolution of the earth and its inhabi¬ tants. The mind, when warmed, is more susceptible of impressions than in a cool state ; and a depressing or melancholy object listened to, makes the strongest impression when it reaches ihe mind in its highest state of elevation or cheerfulness",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"There is a species of grateful remorse, which some¬ times has been known to operate forcibly on the minds of the most hardened in impudence. Of this Mr An¬ drews, who makes the remark, gives an instance in the following anecdote, said to have been a favourite one with the late Dr Campbell. “ Towards the beginning of this century, an actor, celebrated for mimicry, was to have been employed by a comic author, to take off the person, the manner, and the singularly awkward deliveiy of the celebrated Dr Woodward, who was in¬ tended to be introduced on the stage in a laughable character, (viz. in that of Dr Fossile, in Three Hours after Marriage). The mimic dressed himself as a coun- 2 try man, and waited on the doctor with a long cata- Gratitude logue of ailments, which he said attended on his wife. [| The physician heard with amazement diseases and pains Grave' of the most opposite nature, repeated and redoubled on the wretched patient. For, since the actor’s greatest wish was to keep Dr Woodward in his company as long as possible, that he might make the more observations on his gestures, he loaded his poor imaginary spouse with every infirmity which had any probable chance of pro¬ longing the interview. At length, being become com¬ pletely master of bis errand, he drew from his purse a guinea, and, with a scrape, made an uncouth offer of it",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"However, it is probable, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of Strabo } for his papers contain a great number of notes and geo¬ graphical disquisitions on that author, particularly with respect to that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he has left upon almost every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that philosopher than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncom¬ mon labour was the Anthologia. In an interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has tran¬ scribed several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading ; has inserted a great number of cri¬ tical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, is uncertain. The only work which he meditated upon with this direct view from the be¬ ginning was a history of English poetry, upon a plan sketched out by Mr Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to those three fine imita¬ tions of Norse and Welsh poetry, which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems. But after he had made some considerable preparations for the exe¬ cution of this design, and Mr Mason had offered him his assistance, he was informed, that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relin¬ quished, by mutual consent; and soon after, on that gentleman’s desiring a sight of the plan, our author readily sent him a copy of it","Asia, Plato, Oxford","IN,PH,CO,US,GR,UK,GB",6,"India,Philippines,Colombia,United States,Greece,N/A,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,South America,North America,Europe,N/A,Europe"

"GREAVES, John, an eminent physician and an¬ tiquary, was the eldest son of John Greaves rector of Colemore, near Alresford in Hampshire, and born in 1602. He was educated at Baliol College in Oxford, from which he removed to Merton. He was after¬ wards, on the foot of his great merit, chosen geo¬ metry professor of Gresham college His ardent thirst of knowledge soon carried him into several parts of Greaves Europe, where he eagerly seized every opportunity of II improving it. His next voyage was into the eastern Greece, countries ; where nothing remarkable in the heavens, "" * earth, or ^n subterraneous places, seems to have escaped his nice observation. He, with indefatigable industry, and even at the peril of his life, collected a considerable number of Arabic, Persic, and Greek manuscripts, for Archbishop Laud. Of these he well knew the value, as he was a master of the languages in which they were written. He also collected for that prelate many oriental gems and coins.

"The first expedition in which we find the Greeks united, was that against Troy, the particulars of which are recited under the article Troy. Their success here (which happened about 1184 B. C.) cost them very dear ; vast numbers of their bravest warriors be¬ ing slain ; great numbers of the survivors being cast away in their return ; and many of those who had the good luck to get back again being soon after mur¬ dered, or driven out of their country. It is probable, however, that their having staid for such a long time in Asia, might contribute to civilize the Greeks some¬ what sooner than what they otherwise would lia%-e been ; and accordingly, from this time, we find theis history somewhat less obscure, and as it were begin¬ ning to emerge out of darkness. The continual wars, indeed, in which they were engaged among themselves, no doubt, for a long time, prevented them from ma¬ king any considerable advances in those arts in which they afterwards made so great progress. These wars, which G R E L 85 J G R E ,e which indeed never ceased as long as the Greeks pre- w served their liberty, rendered them brave, and skilled in the military art above all other nations j but at the same time they effectually prevented them from making permanent conquests, and confined them within the bounds of their own country j while the different states were one way or other so equally balanced, that scarce one of them was able perfectly to subdue another. The Spartans, however, having with great difficulty, re¬ duced the kingdom of Messene, and added its terri¬ tories to their own, became the leading people in Greece.

"Modern Greece comprehends Macedonia; Albania, now called Arnaut; Epirus; Thessaly, now Jana; A- chaia, now Livadia; the Peloponnesus, now Morea; together with the islands on its coast, and in the Archi¬ pelago. The continent of Greece is seated betwixt the 36th and 43d degrees of north latitude; and be¬ tween the 19th and 23th degrees of longitude, east of London. To the north, it is bounded by Bulga¬ ria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains ; to the south by the Mediterranean sea ; to the east by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the west by the Adriatic or gulf of Venice. Its length is said to be about 450 miles, and its utmost breadth about 335 miles. The air is extremely tem¬ perate and healthy : and the soil fruitful, though bad¬ ly cultivated ; yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and venison. As to re¬ ligion, Christianity was planted in Greece soon after the death of our Saviour, and flourished there for many ages in great purity; but since the Greeks became subject to the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into the most deplorable ignorance, in consequence of the slavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their re¬ ligion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and absur¬ dities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Constantinople ; who is chosen by the neighbouring archbishops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a person of great dig¬ nity, being the head and director of the eastern church- The G R E [ 86 ] G R E Greece. The other patriarchs are those of Jerusalem, Antioch, —-v——' and Alexandria. Mr Tournefort tells us, that the pa¬ triarchates are now generally set to sale, and bestowed upon those who are the highest bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, are always cho¬ sen from among the Caloyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a vest of linsey-woolsey, or some other stuff, presented by the grand signior to ambassadors, and other persons newly invested with some considerable dignity, they are obliged to make large presents to the vizir, &c. The income of the patriarch of Constantinople is said to amount to no less than one hundred and twenty thou¬ sand guilders, of which he pays the one-half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman Porte, adding six thousand guilders besides as a present at the feast of Bairam. The next person to a bishop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then come the abbot, the arch-priest, the priest, the dea¬ con, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lectu¬ rer.

Af¬ terwards, by agreement with Dr Cullen, professor of the theory of physic, these two eminent men gave al¬ ternate courses of the theory and of the practice.—As a public speaker, Dr Gregory’s manner was simple, natural, and animated. W ithout the graces of ora¬ tory, which the subject he bad to treat in a great de¬ gree precluded, he expressed his ideas with uncommon perspicuity, and in a style happily attempered between the formality of studied composition and the ease of conversation. It was his custom to premeditate, for a short time before entering the college, the subject of his lecture, consulting those authors to whom he had occasion to refer, and marking in short notes the ar¬ rangement of his intended discourse: then fully ma¬ ster of his subject, and confident of his own powers, he Grf ^ trusted to his natural facility of expression to convey u—^ those opinions which he had maturely deliberated. The only lectures which he committed fully to writing, were those introductory discourses which he read at the beginning of his annual course, and which are publish¬ ed in these volumes under the title of Lectures on the Duties and Qualifications of a Physician. Of these, which were written with no view to publication, many copies were taken by his pupils, and some from the original ma'miscript, which he freely le nt for their peru¬ sal. On hearing that a copy had been offered for sale to a bookseller, it became necessary to anticipate a fraudulent, and perhaps a mutilated publication, by au¬ thorising an impression from a corrected copy, of which he gave the profits to a favourite pupil. These lec¬ tures were first published in 1770, and afterwards in an enlarged and more perfect form in 1772",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

"rIhe manner in which they procure the preparation is thus: they have in China no such thing as silver coin¬ ed money, but they use in commerce bars or masses of silver ; these they pay and receive in large bargains; and among a nation so full of fraud as the Chinese, it is no wonder that these are too often adulterated with too great an alloy of copper. They pass, how¬ ever, in this state, in the common payments. There are some occasions, however, such as the paying the taxes and contributions, on which they must have their silver pure and fine : on this occasion they have recourse to certain people, whose sole business it is to refine the silver, and separate it from the copper and the lead it contains. This they do in furnaces made for the pur¬ pose, and with very convenient vessels. While the copper is in fusion, they take a small brush, and dip the end of it into water; then striking the handle of the brush, they sprinkle the water by degrees upon the melted copper ; a sort of pellicle forms itself bv this means on the surface of the matter,'which they take off while hot with pincers of iron, and immediately throwing it into a large vessel of cold water, it forms that red powder which is called the grenaille ; they re¬ peat the operation every time they in this manner se¬ parate the copper ; and this furnishes them with as much of the grenaillc as they have occasion for in their china works",,CN,6,China,Asia

"Grimaldi was amiable in his manners, as well as skilful in his profession : he was generous without profusion, respectful to the great without meanness, and chari¬ table to the poor. The following instance of his bene¬ volence may serve to characterize the man. A Sicilian gentleman, who had retired from Messina with his daughter during the troubles of that country, was re¬ duced to the misery of wanting bread. As he lived over-against him, Grimaldi was soon informed of it •, and in the dusk of the evening, knocking at the Sici¬ lian’s door, without making himself known, tossed in money and retired. The thing happening more than once, raised the Sicilian’s curiosity to know his bene¬ factor *, who finding him out, by hiding himself behind the door, fell down on his knees to thank the hand that had relieved him. Grimaldi remained confused, offered him his house, and continued his friend till his death. He died of a dropsy at Rome in 1680, and left a considerable fortune among six children. The genius of Grimaldi directed him chiefly to landscape, which he executed most happily. His colouring is strongs his touch light and delicate j his situations are uncom¬ monly pleasing; and the leafing of his trees is admi¬ rable. Sometimes, indeed, his colouring G E I ig appears ra- IC8 ] ther too green : but those landscapes, which he painted Grimaif in the manner of Caracci, may serve as models for all |) those who admire the style of that school ; and he de- signed his figures in an elegant taste.

"Gualeor was in the possession of Madajee Scindia, a Mahratta chief, in I779» ^ ^ie close of which year the council-general of Bengal concluded an alliance with the Rana; in consequence of which four batta¬ lions of sepoys of 500 men each, and some pieces of artillery, were sent to his assistance, bis district being overrun by the Mahrattas, and himself almost shut up in his fort ot Gohud. The grand object of this alliance was to penetrate into Scindia’s country, and finally to draw Scindia himself from the western side of India, where he was attending the motions of General God¬ dard, who was then employed in the reduction of Gu¬ zerat ; it being Mr Hastings’s idea, that when Scindia found his own dominions in danger, he would detach himself from the confederacy, of which he was the principal member, and thus leave matters open for an accommodation with the court of Poonah. It fell out exactly as Mr Hastings predicted. Major William Popham was appointed to the command of the little army sent to the liana’s assistance ; and was very suc¬ cessful, as well in clearing his country of the enemy, as in driving them out ol one of their own most valu¬ able districts, and keeping possession of it : and Mr Ha¬ stings, who justly concluded that the capture of Gua¬ leor, if practicable, would not only open the way into Scindia’s country, but would also add to the reputa¬ tion of our arms in a degree much beyond the risk and expence of the undertaking, repeatedly expressed his opinion to Major Popham, together with a wish that it might be attempted ; and founding bis hopes of success on the confidence that the garrison would pro¬ bably have in the natural strength of the place.

"They accordingly climbed up in the night, and found that the guards generally went to sleep after their rounds. Popham now ordered ladders to be made j but with so much secrecy, that until the night of surprise only myself and a few others knew it. On the 3d of August, in the evening, a party was ordered to he in readiness to march under the command of Captain Wil¬ liam Bruce 5 and Popham put himself at the head of two battalions, which were immediately to follow the storming party. To prevent as much as possible any noise in approaching or ascending the rock, a kind of shoes of woollen cloth were made for the sepoys, and stuffed with cotton. At II o’clock the whole detach¬ ment marched from the camp at Reypour, eight miles from Gualeor, through unfrequented paths, and reach¬ ed it at a little before day-break. Just as Captain Bruce arrived at the foot of the rock, he saw the lights which accompanied the rounds moving along the ramparts, and heard the sentinels cough (the mode of signifying that all is well in an Indian camp or garrison), which might have damped the spirit of many men, but served only to inspire him with more confidence, as the moment for action, that is, the interval between the passing the rounds was now ascertained. Accordingly when the lights were gone, the wooden ladders were placed a- gainst the rock, and one of the robbers first mounted, and returned with an account that the guard was retir¬ ed to sleep. Lieutenant Cameron, our engineer, next mounted, and tied a rope-ladder to the battlements of the wall $ this kind of ladder being the only one adapt¬ ed to the purpose of scaling the wall in a body (the wooden ones only serving to ascend from crag to crag of the rock, and to assist in fixing the rope-ladders)",,IN,6,India,Asia

"th.e higher ground planted with millet, Indian corn, and pease of different sorts j their beef excellent j poultry plenty and very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.” Mr Moore, who was sent from England about the year 1735, in the service of the African company, and resided at Janies Fort on the river Gambia, or in other factories on that river, about five years, confirms the above account of the fruitful¬ ness of the country. Captain Smith, who was sent in the year 1726 by the African company to survey their settlements throughout the whole coast of Guinea, * Voyage says *> “ th0 country about the Gambia is pleasant and to Guinea, fruitful j provisions of all kinds being plenty and ex- p. 31, 34. ceeding cheap.” The country on and between the two above-mentioned rivers is large and extensive, in¬ habited principally by those three Negro nations known by the name of Jalqfs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalofs possess the middle of the country. The Fulis principal settlement is on both sides of the Senegal : great numbers of these people are also mixed with the Mandingos j which last are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia. The government of the Jalofs is represented as under a better regulation than can be expected from the common opinion we entertain of the negroes. We are told in Astley’s Collection, “That the king has under him several ministers of state, who assist him in the exercise of justice. The grand jerafo is the chief justice through all the king’s dominions, and goes in circuit from time to time to hear complaints and determine controversies. The king’s treasurer exercises the same employment, and has under him alkairs, who are governors of towns or villages. That the kondi, or viceroy, goes the cir¬ cuit with the chief justice, both to hear causes and in¬ spect into the behaviour of the alkadi, or chief ma¬ gistrate of every village in their several districts.” Vas- concelas, an author mentioned in the Collection, says, “ the ancientest are preferred to be the prince’s coun¬ sellors, who keep always about his person ; and the men of most judgment and experience are the judges.” The Fulis are settled on both sides of the river Senegal: their country, which is very fruitful and populous, extends near 400 miles from east to west. They are generally of a deep tawney complexion, appearing to bear some affinity to the Moors, whose country they join on the north : they are good farmers, and make great harvest of corn, cotton, tobacco, &c. and breed great numbers of cattle of all kinds. But the most particu¬ lar account we have of these people is from Moore, + Travels who saysf, “ Some of these Full blacks, who dwell on into distant both sides the river Gambia, are in subjection to the parts of Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell, having been Africa, prohably driven out of their country by war or famine",Moore,"GM,GN,SN,US,IN",6,"Gambia,Guinea,Senegal,United States,India","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"
"It was in these parts of Guinea that M. Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, was employed from the year 1749 to the year 1753, wholly in making natural and philosophical ob¬ servations on the country about the rivers Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great heats in Senegal, he essays*, “ it is to them that they are partly indebted for the fertility of their lands •, which is so great, that, with oS‘little labour and care, there is no fruit nor grain but grows in great plenty.” Of the soil on the Gambia, he says, “ it is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile ; it produces spontaneous¬ ly, and almost without cultivation, all the necessaries of life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots. Every thing matures to perfection, and is excellent in its kind.” One thing which always surprised him, was the pro¬ digious rapidity with which the sap of trees repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in that country j “ Arid I was never (says he) more astonished, than when landing four days after the locusts had devoured all the fruits and leaves, and even the buds of the trees, to find the trees covered, with new leaves, and they did not seem to me to have suffered much.”—“ It was then (says the same author) the fish season ; you might see them in shoals approaching towards land","Paris, Of","SN,GM,GN,US,TR",6,"Senegal,Gambia,Guinea,United States,Turkey","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"
"This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable •, pro¬ ducing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bosnian, princi¬ pal factor for the Dutch at D’Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold Coast, says, “ The negro inha¬ bitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold : That they are industri¬ ously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture 5 but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here Guinea, in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence all over the Gold Coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, re¬ turning full fraught with millet, jamms, potatoes, and palm oik” The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, “ This country, as well as the Gold Coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees 5 its valleys, betwixt the lulls, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.” He adds, “ In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts 5 but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.” The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, “ was formerly so powerful and po¬ pulous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations ; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined j there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may he compared to the country of Ante just before described j frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and po¬ pulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agri¬ culture 5 some soav corn •, others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.” Smith gives much the same account of the before- mentioned parts of the Gold Coast ; and adds, “ the country about D’Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous 5 and the nearer we come towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow with¬ in the torrid zone.” Barbot also remarks*, rvith re-* spect to the countries of Ante and Adorn, “ That theDficflft soil is very good and fruitful in corn and other pro-°J duce ; which it affords in such plenty, that besides whatP'1^' serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale : they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and Avild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish ; so that nothing is Avanting for the sup¬ port of life and to make it easy.” In the Collection it is said, “ That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and sup¬ ply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine ; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as Avell by Euro¬ peans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.” These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable j not apt to shed human blood, except Avhen much provoked ; and ready to assist one ano¬ ther. In the Collection it is said, “ That the fish¬ ing business is esteemed on the Gold Coast next to tra¬ ding $ that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Kor- mantin 5 from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes, CG G U I [ a. canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread them- selves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish j a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.” Smith says, “ The country about Acra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very de¬ lightful, and the natives courteous and civil to stran¬ gers.” He adds, “ That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not un¬ common to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves.

"In the Collection it is said, that both in Congo and Angola, the soil is in general fruitful, producing great plenty of grain, Indian corn, and such quantities of rice, that it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots, and palm oil in plenty.

It was first visited by an European ship in 1529. Saavedra, a Portuguese, who made the discovery of the north-west part of this country, called it Terra de Papuas, or Papts.

"“Exam. II. The same bullet, fired with its whole weight in powder, acquires a velocity ot about 2100 feet in a second, to which there corresponds a potential random of about 45700 yards. But this number greatly exceeding 13000 yards, it must be reduced by the method described in the third corollary of the first proposition, when it becomes 19700 yards. If now the actual range of this bullet at 150 be required, we shall from hence find, that the potential range at 150 is 9850 yards; which, divided by the reduced F of the last example, gives for a quote 2975 : and thence following the steps prescribed above, the actual range of this bullet comes out 1396 yards, exceeding the for¬ mer range by no more than 337 yards; whereas the difference between the two potential ranges is above ten miles. Of such prodigious efficacy is the resistance of the air, which hath been hitherto treated as too in¬ significant a power to be attended to in laying down the theory of projectiles ! “ ScHOL. I must here observe, that as the density of the atmosphere perpetually varies, increasing and di¬ minishing often by TV part, and sometimes more, in a few hours ; for that reason I have not been over ri¬ gorous in forming these rules, but have considered thi m as sufficiently exact when the errors of the ap¬ proximation do not exceed the inequalities which would take place by a change of tt0- part in the den¬ sity of the , atmosphere. With this restriction, the rules of this proposition may be safely applied in all possible cases of practice. That is to say, they will exhibit the true motions of all kinds of shells and can¬ non-shot, as far as 450 of elevation, and of all mus¬ ket huliets fired with their largest customary charges, if not elevated more than 30°. Indeed, if experi¬ ments are made with extraordinary quantities of pow¬ der, producing potential randoms greatly surpassing the usual rate ; then in large angles some farther mo¬ difications may be necessary. And though, as these cases are beyond the limits of all practice, it may be thought unnecessary to consider them; yet, to enable those who are so disposed to examine these uncommon cases, I shall here insert a proposition, which will de¬ termine the actual motion of a projectile at 450, how enormous soever its original velocity may be. But as this proposition will rather relate to speculative than practical cases, instead of supposing the actual range known, thence to assign the potential random, I shall now suppose the potential random given, and the actual range to be thence investigated",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

"The best pieces will burst when the ball is not sufficient¬ ly rammed home, so that a space is left between it and the powder. A very small windage or passage for the inflamed powder between the sides of the barrel and ball will be sufficient to prevent the accident; but if the ball has been forcibly driven down with an iron ram¬ rod, so as to fill up the cavity of the barrel very exact¬ ly, the piece will almost certainly burst, if only a very small space be left between it and the powder; and the greater the space is, the more certainly does the event Take place. Of this Mr Robins gives a remarkable in¬ stance, accounting at the same time for the phenome¬ non. “ A moderate charge of powder (says he), when it G UN [ 19S ] G u N Gun- ^ has expanded itself through the vacant space and Smithery. reaches the ball, will, by the velocity each part has ' “ acquired, accumulate itself behind the ball, and will thereby be condensed prodigiously : whence, if the bar¬ rel be not of an extraordinary strength in that part, it must infallibly burst. The truth ot this I have ex¬ perienced in a very good Tower musket forged of very tough iron: for charging it with 12 pennyweights of powder, and placing the ball loosely 16 inches from the breech ; on the firing of it, the part of the barrel just behind the bullet was swelled out to double its dia¬ meter like a blown bladder, and two large pieces of two inches in length were burst out of it.” A piece will frequently burst from having its mouth stopped up with earth or snow j which accident sometimes happens to sportsmen in leaping a ditch, in which they have as¬ sisted themselves with their fowling-piece, putting the mouth of it to the ground j and when this does not happen, it is only to be accounted for from the stop¬ page being extremely slight. For the same reason a musket will certainly burst if it be fired with the muz¬ zle immersed only a very little way in water. It will also burst from an overcharge ; but when such an ac¬ cident happens in other circumstances, it is most proba¬ bly to be attributed to a defect in the workmanship, or in the iron itself. These defects are principally an im¬ perfection in the welding, a deep flaw having taken place, or an inequality in the bore j which last is the most common of any, especially in the low-priced bar¬ rels. The reason of a barrel’s bursting from an ine¬ quality in the boi’e is, that the elastic fluid, set loose by the inflammation of the powder, and endeavouring to expand itself in every direction, being repelled by the stronger parts, acts with additional force against the weaker ones, and frequently bursts through them, which it would not have done had the sides been equally thick and strong throughout. W'ith regard to defects arising from the bad quality of the iron, it is impossible to say any thing certain. As the choice of the mate¬ rials depends entirely on the gunsmith, the only way to be assured of having a barrel made of proper metal is to purchase it from an artist of known reputation, and to give a considerable price for the piece",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

There were some of these sages in Africa} but the most celebrated clan of them was in India. The African gymnoso¬ phists dwelt upon a mountain in Ethiopia, near the Nile, without the accommodation either of house or cell. They did not form themselves into societies like those of India ; but each had his private recess, where he studied and performed his devotions by himself. If any person had killed another by chance, he applied to these sages for absolution, and submitted to whatever penances they enjoined.

"They are a strange kind of commonwealth among themselves of wandering impostors and jugglers, who made their first appearance in Germany about the be¬ ginning of the 16th century. Munster, it is true, who is followed and relied upon by Spelman, fixes the time of their first appearance to the year 1417 : as lle owns that the first whom he ever saw were in 1529, it is probably an error of the press for 1517 ; especially as other historians inform us, that when Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in the year 1517, several of the na¬ tives refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and re¬ volted under one Zinganeus ; whence the Turks call them Zinganees ; but being at length surrounded and ■ banished, they agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of su¬ perstition and credulity. In the compass of a very few years they gained such a number of idle proselytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and be¬ took themselves to the same arts of chiromancy, beg¬ ging, and pilfering), that they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.— Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1560, and from Spain in 1591. And the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in 1530 they are described by Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. as “ an outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, i> using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have come into this realm, and gone from shire to shire, and place to place, in great companies, and used great, subtle, ‘ and crafty means to deceive the people ; bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men’s and ( women’s fortunes ; and so many times by craft and shb- tility have deceived the people of their money, and also ► have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.” t Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, and forfei¬ ture of their goods and chattels ; and upon their trials > for any felony which they may have committed, they shall not be entitled to a jury de medietate linguce. And afterwards it is enacted, by statutes 1st and 2d Ph. and Mary, c. 4. and 5th Eliz. c. 20. that if any such per¬ sons shall he imported into the kingdom, the importer shall forfeit 40I.

Un¬ checked by any idea of shame, they give wav to every desire. Ihe mother endeavours, by the most scanda¬ lous arts, to train up her daughter for an offering to sensuality; and this is scarce grown up before she be¬ comes the seducer of others. Laziness is so prevalent among them, that were they to subsist by their own la¬ bour only, they would hardly have bread for two of the seven days in the week. This indolence increases their propensity to stealing and cheating, the common attend¬ ants on idleness. They seek to avail themselves of every opportunity to satisfy their lawless desires. Their universal bad character therefore for fickleness, infide- lity, ingratitude, revenge, malice, rage, depravity, la¬ ziness, knavery, thievishness, and cunning, though not deficient in capacity and cleverness, render these people ol no use in society, except as soldiers to form maraud- ing parties.

"Their language differs entirely from the Coptic; and their customs are very different from those of the Egyp¬ tians. They are indeed to be found in Egypt j but they wander about there as strangers, and form a di¬ stinct people, as in other countries. The expressions of Bellonius are strong and decisive : “ No part of the world, I believe, is free from those banditti, wander¬ ing about in troops, whom we by mistake call Egyp¬ tians and Bohemians. When we were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of these strolling thieves sitting under palm trees j and they are esteemed foreigners in Egypt as well as among us.” The Egyptian descent of the gypsies being rejected, Gypsies, our author next endeavours to show that they come ''——y—— from Hindostan. The chief basis of his theory, how¬ ever, is no other than that very dubious one, a simila¬ rity of language. He adds a long vocabulary of the gypsy and the Hindostanic languagesin which, it must be confessed, many words are the same y but ma¬ ny are difterent. A principal proof which he adduces on this head is from the relation of Captain Szekely von Doha, to whom a printer in 1763 related, that a preacher of the Reformed church, when a student at Leyden, being intimately acquainted with three young Malabar students, took down laoo of their words, which he fancied corresponded with the gypsy language; and they added, that a tract of land in their island was named Ozigania. He repeated these words to the Ra— her gypsies, who explain them without trouble or hesi¬ tation. This account was published in the Vienna Ga¬ zette. Supposing these three young men to be sons of Bramins, who use the Sanscrit, the common language of Hindostan comes as near to that as modern Italian to pure Latin. The comparison of the two languages takes up above 30 pages ; and Mr Grellman thinks it establishes his system. The same opinion is maintained by Mr Marsden, in a paper upon this subject in the 7th volume of the Archeologia. The numerals, however, both in Hindostanic and gypsy, differ greatly as stated by the two authors. And here, as in other such com¬ parisons, one is astonished at the credulity of the com¬ parers of orthoepy and orthography (as a periodical cri¬ tic observes), which can have no connection in langua¬ ges with which we are not perfectly familiar, even were both languages reduced to writing by their respective people : how much less, then, where one of the two languages is never reduced to writing, as is the case of the gypsy, but it is blended with the language of the country where the clan resides ? This appears from the correspondence of several words in all languages with the gypsy. Mr Grellman acknowledges the two gypsy versions of the Lord’s Prayer, at different periods, differ so widely, that one would almost be inclined to doubt whether they were really the same language. We think we can discern a few words differently indeed written, but probably pronounced alike. Nor can we, in all the languages in which Chamberlayne gives the Lord’s Prayer, perceive the least resemblance to the gypsy name of father, Dade and Dady except in the Welsh, Taad. In prosecuting his argument, Mr Grellm&n does not insist on the similarity of colour between the two people, nor on the cowardice common to both, nor on the attachment of the Indians to tents, or letting their children go naked ; all these being traits to be met with in other nations: but he dwells on the word Polgar, the name of one of the first gypsy leaders, and of the Hindostanic god of marriage; also on the corres¬ pondence between the travelling smiths in the two peo¬ ple, who carry two pair of bellows ; the Indian’s boy blows them in India, the wife or child ot the gypsy in Europe : as if every travelling tinker, in every nation where tinkers travel, had not the same journeymen","Cairo, Doha","EG,IN,QA,IT,GB",6,"Egypt,India,Qatar,Italy,United Kingdom","Africa,Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe"
"He compares the manners of this class with those of the gypsies, and enumerates many circumstances in which they agree : some of the comparisons are frivolous, and prove nothing. As an instance of which we may take the following: ‘ Gypsies are fond of being about horses j the Suders in India likewise, for which reason they are commonly employed as horse-keepers by the Europeans resident in that country.’ This reasoning does not prove that the gypsies are Suders, any more than that they are Arabians or Yorkshire farmers",,IN,6,India,Asia
"The objections, however, to which this learned and industrious author’s theory is liable, are such as only show it to be by no means satisfactory j but do not prove that it is wrong. It may possibly be right; and upon this supposition the cause of their emigration from their country, he conjectures, not without proba¬ bility, to be the war of Timur Beg in India. In the years 1408 and 1409 this conqueror ravaged India; and the progress of his arms was attended with devasta¬ tion and cruelty. All who made resistance were de¬ stroyed ; those who fell into the enemy’s hands were G Y S made slaves ; of these very slaves 100,000 were put Gypsi, to death. As on this occasion an universal panic took j] place, what could be more natural than that a great Gyd>°i number of terrified inhabitants should endeavour to save themselves by flight ?—In the last place, the author en¬ deavours to trace the route by which the gypsies came from Hindostan to Europe : but here he justly acknow¬ ledges that all that can be said on the subject is mere surmise ; and, upon the whole, after perusing all the preceding details, the reader will probably be of opi¬ nion that there still hangs a cloud over the origin of this extraordinary race",,IN,6,India,Asia

"HABDALA, a ceremony of the Jews observed on the evening of the sabbath when every one of the fa¬ mily ( p * H A B [ 209 ] H A B dala mily is come home.

Psal. cxvi. and “ The Jews had light and gladness,” &c. Esth. viii. he blesses the wine and spices. Afterwards he blesses the light of the fire ; and then casts his eyes on his hands and nails, as remem¬ bering that he is going to work. The whole is in¬ tended to signify, that the sabbath is over, and is from that moment divided from the day of labour which follows.

Some mistake it for the ancient Apamea ; but this is now called Afamiyah, and is situated a day’s journey from Hamah. Hamah is situated among hills, and has a castle seated on a hill.

It is, however, like most other towns under the Turkish government, going to decay. Many of the houses are half ruined; but those which are still standing, as well as the mosques and castle, have their walls built of black and white stones, disposed in such a manner as to form various fi¬ gures. The river Assi, the ancient Orontes, runs by the side of the castle, and fills the ditches round it, which are cut very deep into the rock. This river, leaving the castle, passes through the town from south to north, and has a bridge over it, though it is pretty broad. In its course through the town it turns 18 great wheels, called by the natives saki, which raise great quantities of water to a considerable height, and throw it into canals supported by arches, by which means it is conveyed into the gardens and fountains",Asia,"TR,SY,PH",6,"Turkey,Syrian Arab Republic,Philippines","Asia,Asia,Asia"

"HAMI, or Ha-mi, a country of Asia, subject to the Chinese. It is situated to the north-east of China, at the extremity of that desert which the Chinese call Chamo, and the Tartars Cobi; and is only 90 leagues * distant from the most westerly point of the province of Chensi. This conntry was inhabited in the early ages Gg 2 by HAM [ 236 ] HAM by a wandering people named long. About tbe year 950 before the Christian era, they sent deputies to pay homage to the emperor of China, and presented some sabres by way of tribute. The civil wars by which China was torn about the end of the dynasty ol Tcheou having prevented assistance from being sent to these people, they fell under the dominion of the Hiong- nou, who appear to have been the same as the Hons, and who at that time were a formidable nation. I he Chinese several times lost and recovered the country of Hami. In 131 (the sixth year of the reign of Chun- ty, of the dynasty of the eastern Han), the emperor kept an officer there in quality of governor. Under the following dynasties, the same vicissitudes were ex¬ perienced ; Hami was sometimes united to the pro¬ vince of Chensi, sometimes independent of it, and sometimes even of the whole empire. The situation of these people (separated by vast deserts from China, to which, besides, they had no relation, either in lan¬ guage, manners, or customs) must have greatly contri¬ buted to facilitate these revolutions. All the tributary states of the empire having revolted in 610, that of Hami followed their example ; but it again submitted to the voke under Tai-tsong, second emperor of the dynasty of Tang, who had sent one of his generals with an army to reduce it. This great prince paid particular attention to his new conquest. He divided it into three districts, and connected its civil and mi¬ litary government in such a manner to that of the pro¬ vince of Chensi and other neighbouring countries, that tranquillity prevailed there during his reign and seve¬ ral of those that followed. Through Hami all the cara¬ vans which went from the. west to China, or from China to the west, were obliged to pass. The empe¬ rors, predecessors of Tai-tsong, were satisfied with cau¬ sing wine to be transported from Hami in skins car¬ ried by camels j but “ Tai-tsong (says the Chinese history) having subdued the kingdom of Hami, or¬ dered some vine-plants of the species called majou, to be brought him, which he caused to be planted in his gardens : he, besides, learned the manner of making wine, the use of which proved both serviceable and hurtful to him.” Luxury and effeminacy having weak¬ ened tbe dynasty of Tang, the Mahometans (who had made a rapid progress in all the countries that are situated between Persia, Cobi, and the Caspian sea) advanced as far as Hami, which they conquered. It appears, that this country afterwards had princes of its own, but dependent on the Tartars, who successively ruled these immense regions. The Yuen or Mogul Tartars again united the country of Hami to the pro¬ vince of Chensi j and this reunion subsisted until 1360, at which time the emperor formed it into a kingdom, on condition of its princes doing homage and paying tribute. The king of Hami was honoured with a new title in 1404, and obtained a golden seal. After a contest of several years for the succession to the throne, the kingdom of Hami fell a prey to the king of Tou-eulh-fan. This yoke soon became uneasy to tbe people of Hami : they revolted from their new masters, and made conquests from them in their turn","Asia, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami","CN,PH",6,"China,Philippines","Asia,Asia"
"Since this epocha, the country of Hami has been suc¬ cessively exposed to anarchy, or governed by its own v- princes. The prince who filled tbe throne in 1696 acknowledged himself a vassal of the empire, and sent as ti’ibute to Peking camels, horses, and sabres. Kang- hi received his homage with the usual ceremonies, and published a diploma, which established the rank that the king of Hami should hold among the tributary princes, the time when he should come to render ho¬ mage, the nature of the presents necessary for his tri¬ bute, the number of auxiliaries he was bound to fur¬ nish in time of war, and the manner of his appointing a successor. All these regulations have subsisted till this time","Hami, Hami",CN,6,China,Asia
"The country of Hami, though surrounded by de¬ serts, is accounted one of the most delightful in the world. The soil produces abundance of grain, fruits, leguminous plants, and pasture of every kind. The rice which grows here is particularly esteemed in Chi¬ na } and pomegranates, oranges, peaches, raisins, and prunes, have a most exquisite taste 5 even the jujubes are so juicy, and have so delicious a flavour, that the Chinese call them perfumed jujubes. There is no fruit more delicate or more in request than the melons of Hami, which are carried to Peking for the emperor’s table. These melons are much more wholesome than those of Europe 5 and have this singular property, that they may be kept fresh during great part of the win¬ ter.— But the most useful and most esteemed produc¬ tion of this country is its dried raisins. These are of two kinds : The first, which are most used in the Chinese medicine, seem to have a perfect resemblance to those known in Europe by the name of Corinthian","Hami, Hami",CN,6,China,Asia
"The second, which are in much greater request for the table, are smaller and more delicate than those of Pro¬ vence. The Chinese authors perfectly agree with Messrs Lemery and Geoffrey, respecting the virtue and qualities of these dried grapes or raisins 5 but they at¬ tribute so much more efficacy to those of Hami than to those of China, that they prescribe them in smaller doses. They observe, that an infusion of the first is of great service in facilitating an eruption of the small¬ pox about the fourth day, when the patient either is or seems to be too weak j and to promote a gentle perspiration in some kinds of pleurisies or malignant fevers. The dose must be varied according to the age, habit of body, and strength of the patient; great care must be taken to administer this remedy season¬ ably and with judgment. The emperor caused plants to be transported from Hami to Peking, which were immediately planted in his gardens. As these plants were cultivated with extraordinary care, under his own eyes, they have perfectly succeeded. The raisins pro¬ duced by them are exceedingly sweet, and have a most exquisite flavour","Hami, Hami",CN,6,China,Asia
"Although the country of Hami (the latitude of which is 42,0 53' 20"") lies farther towards the north than several of the provinces of France, we are assured that its climate is more favourable to the culture of vines, and that it gives a superior degree of quality to the grapes. It never rains at Hami ; even dews and fogs are scarcely ever seen there ; the country is wa¬ tered only by the snow which falls in winter, and by the water of this snow when melted, which is collected at the bottoms of the mountains, and preserved with great HAM [ 237 ] HAM Ham}, great care and industry. The method of drying grapes ajnilton in Hami is much simpler than that practised in the —provinces of China. The people of Chensi hold them over the steam of hot wine, and even sometimes hoil them a few seconds in wine in which a little clarified honey has been diluted. In the kingdom of Hami they wait until the grapes are quite ripe 5 they then expose them to the scorching rays of the sun ; after¬ wards pick them, and leave them in that manner until they are quite dry. How'ever dry these grapes may be, they become shrivelled, without losing any of their substance, and without growing flat : good raisins ought to be almost as crisp as sugar candy","Hami, Hami, Hami, Hami","CN,FR",6,"China,France","Asia,Europe"
"The kingdom of Hami contains a great number of villages and hamlets ; but it has properly only one city, which is its capital, and has the same name. It is surrounded by lofty walls, which are half a league in circumference, and has two gates, one of which fronts the east, and the other the west. These gates are ex¬ ceedingly beautiful, and make a fine appearance at a distance. The streets are straight, and well laid out j but the houses (which contain only a ground-floor, and which are almost all constructed of earth) make very little show : however, as this city enjoys a serene sky, and is situated in a beautiful plain, watered by a river, and surrounded by mountains which shelter it from the north winds, it is a most agreeable and de¬ lightful residence. On whatever side one approaches it, gardens may he seen which contain every- thing that a fertile and cultivated soil can produce in the mildest climates. All the surrounding fields are en¬ chanting : but they do not extend far; for on several sides they terminate in dry plains, where a number of beautiful horses are fed, and a species of excellent sheep, which have large flat tails that sometimes weigh three pounds. The country of Hami appears to be very abundant in fossils and valuable minerals : the Chinese have for a long time procured diamonds and a great deal of gold from it j at present it supplies them with a kind of agate, on which they set a great value. With regard to the inhabitants of this small state, they are brave, capable of enduring fatigue, very dexterous in all bodily exercises, and make excellent soldiers ; but they are fickle and soon irritated, and when in a passion they are extremely ferocious and sanguinary","Hami, Hami",CN,6,China,Asia
"-v 'The courtier repairs to the queen’s apartment, and hides himself under a heap of straw (b). Hamlet, up¬ on entering the cabinet, suspecting the presence of some spy, imitates, after his usual affectation of folly, the crow of cock, and, shaking his arms like wings, jumps (c) upon the heap of straw ; till, feeling the courtier, he draws his sword, and instantly dispatches him. He then cuts the body to pieces, boils it, and gives it to the hogs. He then avows to his mother that he only personated a fool, reproaches her for her incestuous marriage with the murderer of her husband ; and concludes his remonstrances by saying, “ Instead, therefore, of condoling my insanity, deplore your own infamy, and learn to lament the deformity of your own mind (d).” The queen is silent ; but is recalled to virtue by these admonitions. Fengo returns to Elsi- neur, sends Hamlet to England under the care of two courtiers, and requests the king by a letter to put him to death. Hamlet discovers and alters the letter j so that, upon their arrival in England, the king orders the two courtiers to immediate execution, and betroths his daughter to Hamlet, who gives many astonishing proofs of a most transcendant understanding. At the end of the year he returns to Denmark, and alarms the court by his unexpected appearance ; as a report of his death had been spread, and preparations w'ere making for his funeral. Having re-assumed his affected insanity, he purposely wounds his finger in drawing his sword, which the bystanders immediately fasten to the scabbard. He afterwards invites the principal nobles to an entertainment, makes them intoxicated, and in that state covers them with a large curtain, which he fastens to the ground with wooden pegs ; he HAM then sets fire to the palace ; and the nobles, being en¬ veloped in the curtain, perish in the flames. During this transaction he repairs to Fengo’s apartment ; and, taking the sword which lay by the side of his bed, puts his own in its place ; he instantly awakens and informs him, that Hamlet is come to revenge the murder of his father. Fengo starts from his bed, seizes the sword ; but being unable to draw it, falls by the hand of Hamlet. The next morning, when the populace were assembled to view the ruins of the palace, Hamlet snm- mons the remaining nobles 5 and in a masterly speech, which is too long to insert in this place, lays open the motives of his own conduct, proves his uncle to have been the assassin of lus father; and concludes in the fol¬ lowing words: “ Tread upon the ashes of the monster, who, polluting the wife of his murdered brother, join¬ ed incest to parricide } and ruled over you with the most oppressive tyranny. Receive me as the minister of a just revenge, as one who felt for the suflerings of his father and his people. Consider me as the person who has purged the disgrace of his country ; extin¬ guished the infamy of his mother; freed you from the despotism of a monster, whose crimes, if he had lived, would have daily increased, and terminated in your destruction. Acknowledge my services; and if I have deserved it, present me with the crown. Behold in me the author of these advantages : no degenerate person, no parricide; but the rightful successor to the throne, and the pious avenger of a father’s murder. I have rescued you from slavery, restored you to liberty, and re-established your glory : I have destroyed a tyrant, and triumphed over an assassin. The recompense is in your hands : you can estimate the value of my services, and in your virtue I rest my hopes of reward.” This speech [ 239 1 (®) ^ reader will recollect, that straw used formerly to be spread over the floors as an article of great luxury. ° (c) Ihis part stands thus in the English account: “ The counsellor entered secretly into the queene’s cham¬ ber, and there hid himselfe behind the arras, and long before the queene and Hamlet came thither: who being craftie and politique, as soone as he w'as within the chamber, doubting some treason, and fearing if he should speak severely and wisely to his mother touching his secret practises hee should be understood, and by that means intercepted, used his ordinary manner of dissimulation, and began to come (r. crow) like a cocke, beating with his arms (in such manner as cockes used to strike with their wings) upon the hangings of the chambers ; whereby feeling something stirring under them, he cried, Aral! a rat! and presently drawing his sworde, thrust it into the hangings ; which done, he pulled the counsellor (half deade) out by the heels, made an end ef killing him ; and, being slain, cut his body in pieces, which he caused to be boiled, and then cast it into an open vault or privie.” Malone's Supplement, vol. i. p. 357",Aral,"DK,KZ,UK",6,"Denmark,Kazakhstan,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"

"“ I do not see (says he) why these difficulties should cheek our author’s inclination to declare in favour of the Carthaginian. That Fabius was not beaten by Hannibal, we cannot much wonder, when we remem¬ ber how steadily the old man kept to his resolution never to fight with him. Bu-t from Fabius’s taking this method to put a stop to the victories of the ene- my, may we not conclude that lie knew no other, and thought Hannibal an overmatch for him ? And why does our author forget Publius Scipio (Africanus’s father), a prudent and able general, whom Hannibal vanquished at the Ticin ? Livy relates some victories of Hannibal over the celebrated Marcellas ; but nei¬ ther Marcellas nor any other general ever vanquished Hannibal before the battle of Zama, if we may be¬ lieve Polybius (lib. xv. c. 16.). Terentius Varro, in¬ deed, is represented as a headstrong rash man ; but the battle of Cann?e was not lost by his imprudence. The order Hanniba C E,'. j 111 a HAN [ 251 ] HAN mibal order in wlncli lie drew up his army is nowhere con- (1 demned ; and Chevalier Folard thinks it excellent, over. And as to the conduct of the battle, ^Flmilius Paulas, a renowned captain, and a disciple of Fabius, had a greater share in it than his colleague. The imprudence with which Varro is taxed, was his venturing, contrary to his colleague’s advice, with above 90,000 men, to en¬ counter in a plain field an enemy who had only 50,000, but was superior in horse. And does not the very advice ofiEmilius, and the charge of temerity on Varro for not following it, imply a confession of Hannibal’s superio¬ rity in military skill over ^Emilius as well as Varro ? It ought likewise to be observed, that Hannibal’s inr fantry had gained the victory over the Roman infan¬ try, before this latter suffered any thing from the Car¬ thaginian cavalry. It was otherwise when Scipio gained the victory at Zama. His infantry would pro¬ bably have been vanquished but for his cavalry. Han¬ nibal, with only his third line of foot (bis Italian army), maintained a long fight against Scipio’s three lines of foot ; and seems to have had the advantage over them, when Masinissa and Laelius, with the horse, came to their assistance. Polybius indeed says, that Hannibal’s Italian forces were equal in number to all Scipio’s in¬ fantry $ but this is contradicted by Ljvy, and is not very probable. The authority of Polybius, who was an intimate friend of Scipio ZEmilianus, is, I imagine, of little weight in matters where the glory of the Scipios is particularly concerned. His partiality and flattery to them are, in many instances, but too vi¬ sible.” Our author then proceeds to show, that Hannibal was not guilty of any of the faults laid to his charge as a general j and having contrasted the moral cha¬ racters of the two generals with each other, makes it evident, that as a man, as well as a general, Hannibal had greatly the advantage of his rival.

"Of these 35, 10 only are allotted for half tones; there remain therefore 25 for the diatonic scale. The lowest note corresponds to G in the bass clifi ; hence it extends upward to the octave above C in alt. For uniformity, take the glasses which are chosen gradually and regu¬ larly diminishing in size as they ascend in tone. This, however, is not absolutely necessary, as the tone of the glass does not entirely depend upon its size, but in a great measure upon the proportion of its different parts to one another: hence the glass corresponding to one note may be smaller than a glass corresponding to a note three or four times higher : however, where it is practicable, they should always be chosen gradually diminishing as they ascend, both on account of the ele¬ gance of appearance, and that an equality in point of loudness may be preserved ; for, as every body knows, an instrument may be liable to great inequality in point of strength, though perfectly in tune.

"Of all the whims and paradoxes maintained by this philosopher, none is more extravagant than his as¬ sertion, that every chord, except the simple unison, is displeasing to the human ear j nay, that we are only reconciled to octaves themselves by being inured to hear them from our infancy. Strange, that nature should have fixed this invariable proportion between male and female voices, whilst at the same time she in¬ spired the hearers with such violent prepossessions against it as were invincible but by long and confirm¬ ed habit! The translator of D""1 Alembert'1 s Elements, as given under the article Music in this Dictionary, has been at peculiar pains to investigate his earliest recol¬ lections upon this subject j and has had such opportu¬ nities, both of attending to his original perceptions, and of recognising the fidelity of his memary, as are not common. He can remember, even from a period of early childhood, to have been pleased with the sim¬ plest kinds of artificial harmony ; to have distinguished the harmonics of sonorous bodies with delight j and to have been struck with horror at the sound of such bo¬ dies as, by their structure, or by the cohesion of their parts, exhibited these harmonics false. This is the chief, if not the only cause, of the tremendous and disagreeable sensation which we feel from the sound of the Chinese ghong. The same horrible cacophony is fiequently, in some degree, produced by a drum une¬ qually braced : from this sound the translator often re¬ members to have started and screamed, when carried through the streets of the town in which he was born in the arms of his nursery-maid j and as be is consci¬ ous, that the acoustic organs of many are as exquisite as his own, he cannat doubt but they may have had the same sensations, though perhaps they do not recol¬ lect the facts. So early and so nicely may the sensa¬ tions of harmony and discord be distinguished. But after all, it seems that harmony is no more than a mo- Hatm dein invention, and even at this late period only ''““v known to the Europeans. We should, however, be glad to know, from what oracle our philosopher learned that harmony was not known to antiquity. From what remains of their works, no proof of his position can be derived ; and we have at least mentioned one probabi¬ lity against it in our notes to the Preliminary Discourse to the article Music, (see note b). But though Rousseau’s mighty objections were granted, that har¬ mony can only he endured by such ears as are habi¬ tually formed and cultivated ; that the period of its prevalence has been short, and the extent of its em¬ pire limited to Europe ; still his conclusion, that it is a Gothic and barbarous invention, is not fairly deduci- ble even from these premises. Must we affirm, that epic poetry has no foundation in nature, because, du¬ ring the long interval which happened from the begin¬ ning of the world to the destruction of Troy, no epic poem seems to have appeared ? Or because a natural and mellifluous versification is less relished by an unpo¬ lished taste, than the uncouth rhimes of a common bal¬ lad, shall we infer, that the power of numbers is mere¬ ly supposititious and arbitrary ? On the contrary, we will venture to affirm, that though harmony cannot, as Rameau supposes, be mathematically demonstrated from the nature and vibrations of sonorous bodies ; vet the idea of its constituent parts, and of their coales¬ cence, is no less established, no less precise and defi¬ nite, than any mode or property of space or quantity to be investigated by geometrical researches or alge¬ braical calculations. It is certain, that the mimetic or imitative power of music chiefly consists in melody ‘7 but from this truth, however evident, it cannot be fair¬ ly deduced that harmony is absolutely unsusceptible of imitation. Perhaps every musical sound, even to the most simple, and all modulations of sound, are more or less remotely connected with some sentiment or pas¬ sion of the human heart. We know, that there are in¬ stinctive expressions of pain or pleasure in their various modes and degrees, which, when uttered by any sensi¬ tive, and perceived by any conscious being, excite in the miad of the percipient a feeling sympathetic with that by which they are prompted. We likewise know from experience, that all artificial sounds modulated in the same manner, have similar, though not equal, ef¬ fects. We have seen that, in order to render harmony compatible with itself, the melody of each part must be congenial^ and, for that reason, one kindred melo¬ dy results from the whole. So far, therefore, as any composer has it in his power to render the general me¬ lody homogeneous, so far the imitation may be preser¬ ved, and even heightened : for such objects as are ma¬ jestic and august, or the feelings which they excite, are more aptly expressed by a composition of kindred sounds, than by any simple tone whatever. Those who sup¬ pose the mimetic powers of music to be consummated in the imitation of mere unmeaning sounds or degrees of motion, must entertain limited and unworthy ideas of its province. It is naturally a representative almost of every sentiment or affection of the soul; and, when this end is gained, the art must have reached its highest perfection, and produced its noblest effects. But these effects, however sensible among the ancients, may in us be superseded by other causes which remain yet uiv- uoex'plored","Of, Troy","TR,US,CN",6,"Turkey,United States,China","Asia,North America,Asia"

"“ The journeymen tel! me (says Mr Clennell), that the dregs are to hold or fill the body, whilst a little vitriol cleanses it of the dirt, &cc. that may be on the rabbit or other wool; too much vitriol would make the whole that was weighed out to the journeymen work into the hats, but by the mutual action of the vitriol and the dregs, the quantity of the first being small, a- bout a wine glassfull, the dirt and the strong hairs get purged out (the last from the shrinking in being slow, as well as their being straight j for was the lessening of the size at plank rapid, they would, in defiance of their straightness, get entangled, and even as it is, they are slightly so-, but care is taken to get them out by rub¬ bing the body of the bat well with the hand in a circu¬ lar manner) whilst, at the same time, the dregs keep the hats plump. Another advantage attending the use of dregs, whether of beer, porter, or wine, is that as the boiling in the dregs does not draw out much of the mucilage from each hat, when they come to be stiffen¬ ed the dregs form a body within the hat sufficiently strong or retentive to keep the glue from coming through amongst the nap ; vitriol alone would purge or weaken the hats too much, consequently, half the quan¬ tity does better with the addition of dregs, and they disallow the body to be closer from its getting more work : many journeymen, however, to hurry this part of the process, use a quantity of vitriol, and open the body again by throwing in a handful or two of oat¬ meal j by this means they get a great many made, though at the same time they are left quite grainyyi-om the want of labour. This, in handling the dry grav hat, when made, may be in part discovered, but in part only j in wearing the effect is shining spots, as if of •grease, but is, in reality, the glue lodging upon the grainy parts.” Of these reasons for the use of dregs, the last only appears to be perspicuous or at all satisfactory.

"Seveial authors contend, that the square character is not the real ancient Hebrew character, written from the beginning of the language, to the time of the Baby¬ lonish captivity ; but that it is the Assyrian or Chaldee character, which the Jews assumed, and accustomed themselves to, during the captivity, and retained after¬ wards. They say, that the Jews, during their captivi¬ ty, had qqite disused their ancient character; so that Ezra found it necessary to have the sacred books trans¬ cribed into the Chaldean square character. These am t mis add, that what we call the Samaritan character, is t le genuine ancient Hebrew. Of this opinion are ocanger, Bochart, Casaubon, Vossius, Grotius, Wal¬ ton, Capellus, &c. and among the ancients Jerome and Eusebius. On this side it is urged, that the present characters are called Assyrian by the ancient Jewish waters of the Talmud, and therefore must have been roug it fiom Assyria: but to this argument it is re- pued, that there were two sorts of characters anciently in use, viz. the sacred or present square character, and the profane or civil, which we call Samaritan ; and t lat the sacred is called Assyrian, because it first began m Assyria to come into common use. It is farther al¬ leged, H E B [ : liiiew. Ifgetl, tliat the Chaldee letters, which the Jews now l—’ use, were unknown to the ancient Jews before the cap¬ tivity, from Dan. i. 4. Moreover, it is inferred from 2 Kings xvii. 28. whence we learn that a Jewish priest was sent to teach the Samaritans the worship of Jeho¬ vah ; on which occasion he must have taught them the law ; and yet no mention occurs of his teaching them the language or character that the law was then written in, the character which the Samaritans used. But the chief argument is taken from some ancient Jewish she¬ kels, with a legend on one side “ The shekel of Israel,” and on the other “ Jerusalem the holy,” both in Sama¬ ritan characters. These shekels, it is said, must have been coined before the division of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel, or at least before the Assyrian capti¬ vity, because the Samaritans never afterwards reckoned Jerusalem holy. On the other side, or for the primi¬ tive antiquity of the square character, are the two Bux- torls, Leusden, Calovius, Hottinger, Spanheim, Light- foot, &c. They urge, from Matthew v, 18. that jod is really the least of the consonants in the present He¬ brew, whereas it is one of the largest characters in the Samaritan alphabet: but Walton replies, that if our Saviour here speaks of the least letter of the alphabet, we can only infer, that the Chaldee character was used in our Saviour’s time, which is not denied by those who maintain the Samaritan to be the original. They also allege, that the Jews were loo obstinate and super¬ stitious to allow their sacred character to be altered ; Lot if this was done under the direction and authority of Ezra, the argument will be much invalidated. Far¬ ther, they say, that Ezra could not alter the ancient character, because it was impossible to make the alte¬ rations in all their copies. This argument, however, is contradicted by fact; since the old English black let¬ ter is actually changed for the Roman. They say, like¬ wise, that Ezra was not disposed to profane the sacred writings with a heathen character : but this supposes that Ezra was so superstitious as to imagine, that there was some peculiar sanctity in the shape of the letters","Of, Jerusalem, Sama, Jerusalem, Leusden, Roman","IL,TR,ES,NL,RO,UK",6,"Israel,Turkey,Spain,Netherlands,Romania,N/A","Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe,Europe,N/A"

H HEBRON, in Ancient Geography, a very ancient city, situated in the hilly country of the tribe of Judah to the south. Its more ancient name was Kiriath Ar- ba, or Cariath Arba. In antiquity this city vied with most ancient cities of Egypt, being seven years prior to Zoan, translated Tanis by the Seventy. Jo¬ sephus makes it not only older than Tanis, but even than Memphis. It stood to the west of the lake Asphal- tites, and was for some time the royal residence of D avid. After the captivity it fell into the hands of the Edomites, as did all the south country of Judea. It is now called Habroun, situated seven leagues to the south of Bethlehem. The Arabs call it El-kalil, “ the well- beloved which is the epithet they usually apply to Abraham, whose sepulchral grotto they still show* Habroun is seated at the foot of an eminence, on which are some wretched ruins, the mishapen remains of an ancient castle. The adjacent country is a sort of ob¬ long hollow, five or six leagues in length, and not dis¬ agreeably varied by rocky hillocks, groves of fir-trees, stunted oaks, and a few plantations of vines and olive trees. These vineyards are not cultivated with a view to make wine, the inhabitants being such zealous Maho¬ metans as not to permit any Christians to live among them : they are only of use to procure dried raisins, which are badly prepared, though the grapes are of au excellent kind. The peasants cultivate cotton likewise, which is spun by their wives, and sold at Jerusalem and Gaza. They have also some soap manufactories, the kali for which is sold them by the Bedouins ; and a very ancient glass-house, the only one in Syria. They make there a great quantity of coloured rings, brace¬ lets for the wrists and legs, and for the arms above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to Constantinople. In consequence of these manufactures, Mr Volney informs us, Habroun is the most powerful village in all this quarter; and is able to arm 800 or 900 men, who adhere to the faction Kaisi, and are the perpetual enemies of the people of Beth¬ lehem. This discord, which has prevailed throughout the country from the earliest times of the Arabs, causes a perpetual civil war. The peasants are incessantly ma¬ king inroads on each other’s lands, destroying their corn, dourra, sesamum, and olive trees, and carrying off their sheep, goats, and camels. The Turks, who are everywhere negligent in repressing similar disorders, are the less attentive to them here, since their autho¬ rity is very precarious. The Bedouins, whose camps occupy the level country, are continually at open ho¬ stilities with them ; of which the peasants avail them¬ selves to resist their authority, or do mischief to each other, according to the blind caprice of their igno¬ rance or the interest of the moment. Hence arises an anarchy which is still more dreadful than the despotism which prevails elsewhere, while the mutual devastations of the contending parties render the appearance of this part of Syria more wretched than that of any other","Aurora, Memphis, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Gaza","SY,US,EG,ZA,IL,PS",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,United States,Egypt,South Africa,Israel,Palestine, State of","Asia,North America,Africa,Africa,Asia,Asia"
"The event which gave occasion to this epocha, was Mahomet’s flight from Mecca.

"The greatest length of the island is about eight miles, and its circumference is above 20. Some of the moun¬ tains are pretty high, covered with wood to the top, and exhibit marks of volcanic eruptions. The eoun- S s try H E L [ try, according to Mr Forster, has a fine appearance j the soil is in many places a rich mould, from six to ten inches deep, and a variety of plants thrive in it luxuri¬ antly. He found many plants here which he had not observed in any other parts of the world. Among these were some called by the natives cabbage-trees, gum- trees, and redwood. The former thrive in moist places •, but the latter are always found on the ridges ol hills, where the soil is dry. The cabbage-tree has rather large leaves 5 but after many inquiries Mr Forster could not find that it was used for any other purpose than that of fuel, and no reason could be assigned why it had ob¬ tained that name. It must not be confounded with the cabbage-tree of America, India, and the South seas, which is a species of palm",,IN,6,India,Asia
"This island is laid out entirely in gardens and pastu¬ rage. Besides peaches, we are assured that the plantain and banana thrive here remarkably well. Cabbages, and other greens, which thrive extremely well, are de¬ voured by caterpillars j and every species of corn is de¬ stroyed by rats. All the pastures were overrun with furze j which, though in our country a very useless and even pernicious plant, was of singular advantage to the inhabitants of St Helena. Before the introduction of that plant, the ground was parched with the intense heat, and all kinds of grass and herbage were shrivelled up. But the furze-bushes, which throve as it were in despite of the sun, preserved a degree of moisture in the ground •, by which means the grass sprung up vigo¬ rously, and the country became covered with a rich and beautiful sod. The furze is now no longer wanted, and the people assiduously root it out for fuel. The num¬ ber of people on St Helena does not exceed 2000 per¬ sons, including 500 soldiers, and 600 slaves ; and it is said that the number of females born on the island con¬ siderably exceeds that of the males. By the arrival of the India ships, which they supply with refreshments, they are in return provided with all sorts of manufac¬ tures and other necessaries ; and the company annually order one or two of their ships to touch there in their way to India, in order to send them a sufficient quan¬ tity of European goods and provisions. Many of their slaves are employed in catching fish, which are very plentiful j and by the help of these, together with their poultry, cattle, roots, and salt provisions, they subsist through the year. Their life (says Mr Forster"") seems to pass along very happily j free from the multitude of cares which distress their countrymen in England, and blessed with quiet and content",,IN,6,India,Asia
"Of all the monuments which remain relating to the Ileliastfe, the most curious is the oath which those judges took before the Thesmothetse: Demosthenes hath preserved it in his oration against Timocrates, who ha¬ ving been bribed by those who had been intrusted with the effects taken on board a vessel of Naucratis, and re¬ fused to give an account of them, got a law passed, by which an enlargement was granted to prisoners for public debts on giving bail. Demosthenes on making his oration against that law, ordered the oath of the Heliastae to be read aloud, as a perpetual auxiliary to his arguments, and happily calculated to interest the multitude and inflame their passions.

"These relations have been multiplied and prodigiously increased with respect to the marvellous, whenever the figure, the colour, or smell of the animal have any thing extraordinary or forbidding in them, as is the case with the sea-hare. Hence we find a long list of noxious and astonishing properties attributed to this animal. Not only are its flesh, and the water in which it has been steeped, of a poisonous nature, but even its very aspect is deadly. A woman who would wish to conceal her pregnancy, cannot resist the sight of a fe¬ male sea-hare, which produces nausea and vomiting, and finally miscarriage, unless a male of the same spe¬ cies, dried and salted, is given her to eat; for it is one of the superstitious ideas entertained by the common people in most countries, that every noxious species of animal carries within itself a remedy for the ill effects which it may occasion. It happens, indeed, unfortu¬ nately for the present story, that in the sea-hare there is no distinction of sex. If these animals in Italy (for the above stories are taken from Pliny) are so deadly to mankind, it is quite otherwise in the Indian seas ; for there it is man who is such a deadly foe to the sea- hare, that he cannot take it alive, since it is destroved by his very touch ! These ridiculous fables respecting an innocent ani¬ mal, are still believed by many people, and others as ridiculous have been added to them.

"Chinese Hemp, a species of cannabis, of which an account is given in the 72d volume of the Philosophical Transactions, p. 46. In that paper Mr Fitzgerald, vice- president of the society for encouraging arts, mentions his having received the seeds from the late Mr Elliot; which being sown, according to his directions, produ¬ ced plants 14 feet high, and nearly seven inches in cir¬ cumference. These being pulled up in November, and steeped for a fortnight in water, were placed against a southern wall to dry. After this the hemp was found to separate easily from the woody part ; and so great was the produce, that 32 plants yielded three pounds and a quarter. In consequence of this success, Mr Fitzgerald applied to the directors of the India Com¬ pany to procure some of the seeds from China ; which being complied with, the society were furnished, in 1785, with some more of the seeds, which were distri¬ buted HEM [ 373 ] HEN bated to several of the members; but, notwithstanding ;>stead.their endeavours, few of the plants appear to have ir™""' ripened their seeds in this country. Two of the species of hemp, tried by the duke of Northumberland, rose to the height of 14 feet seven inches, and would have been much larger, had they not been hurt by a high wind: another kind arose only to that of three feet and a half, the stem about the size of a common wheat straw ; but though it flowered well, did not pro¬ duce any seed.

Thus it appeared, that the seeds of the Chinese hemp had retained their superiority over those of the English ; though how long they would continue to do so cannot be determined but by expe¬ rience. From this experiment Dr Hinton received a silver medal from the society.

"Fie had a just opinion of tbe great abilities of Sir Walter Raleigh ; and is reported to have said, that, “ no king but bis father would keep such a bird in a cage.” And it is affirmed, that bis highness, but a few months before bis death, obtained the lands and castle of Sherburn in Dorsetshire, the confiscated estate of Sir Walter, with an intention of returning it to him. That eminent writer, soldier, and statesman, bad a reciprocal regard for tbe prince, to whom he bad designed to address a discourse, “ Of the Art of War by Sea,” which las highness’s death prevented the author from finishing. Fie had written likewise to the prince another “ Discourse of a Maritimal Voyage, with the passages and incidents therein:” But this has never yet appeared in print. He had also intended, and, as he expresses it, hewn out a second and third volume of his General History, which were to have been directed to his highness : “ but it has pleased God (says he) to take that glorious prince out of this world, to whom they were directed ; whose unspeakable and never- enough lamented loss hath taught me to say with Job, Versa est in luctum cithara me a, Sf organum meum in vcoem jlentiwn.” In the government of bis household and management of bis revenues, though be was so very young, bis ex¬ ample deserved to be imitated by all other princes",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"With regard to any unlawful passion for women, to the temptations of which the prince’s youth and situa¬ tion peculiarly exposed him, his historian, who knew him, and observed him much, assures us, that having been present at great feasts made in the prince’s house, to which he invited the most beautiful ladies ot the court and city, he could not discover by his highness’s behaviour, eyes, or countenance, the least appearance of a particular inclination to any one of themnor was he at any other time witness of such words or ac¬ tions as could justly be a ground of the least suspicion of his virtue; though he observes, that some persons of that time, measuring the prince by themselves, were pleased to conceive and report otherwise of him. It is indeed asserted by the writer of Anlicus Coquinarice, believed upon good grounds to be William Saunder- son, Esq. author of the “ Complete History of Mary Queen of Scotland, and her son and successor King James,” that the prince made court to the countess ol Essex (afterwards divorced from the earl, and married to the viscount Rochester), before any other lady then living. And Arthur Wilson mentions the many amo¬ rous glances which the prince gave her, till discover¬ ing that she was captivated with the growing fortunes of Lord Rochester, and grounded more hope upon him than the uncertain and hopeless love of his highness, he soon slighted her. The learned and pious antiqua¬ ry, Sir Simonds D’Ewes, in a manuscript life of him¬ self, written with his own hand, and brought down to the year 1637, is positive, that, “ notwithstanding the inestimable Prince Henry’s martial desires and initia¬ tion into the ways of godliness, the countess, being set on by tbe earl of Northampton her father’s uncle, first caught his eye and heart, and afterwards prosti¬ tuted herself to him, who first reaped the fruits of her virginity. But those sparks of grace which even then began to show their lustre in him, w’th those more he¬ roic innate qualities derived from virtue, which gave the law to his more advised actions, soon raised him out of the slumber of that distemper, and taught him to reject her following temptations with indignation and superciliousness.” But these authorities, Dr Birdi observes, ought to have little weight to the prejudice of the prince’s character, against the direct testimony in his favour from so well informed a writer as Sir Charles Cornwallis","Mary, Essex, Rochester, Wilson, Northampton","US,TM",6,"United States,Turkmenistan","North America,Asia"
"Soon after bis removal to Berwick, he published a scheme for raising a fund for the benefit of the widows and orphans of Protestant dissenting ministers in the north of England. This idea was probably suggested by the prosperity of the fund which had almost 30 years before been established for a provision to ministers wi¬ dows, &c. in Scotland. But the situations of the clergy of Scotland were very different from the circumstances of dissenting ministers in England. Annuities and pro¬ visions were to be secured to the families of dissenters, without subjecting the individuals (as in Scotland) to a proportional annual contribution, and without such means of creating a fund as could be the subject of an act of parliament to secure the annual payments. Tire acuteness and activity of Dr Henry surmounted these difficulties ; and, chiefly by his exertions, this useful and benevolent institution commenced about the year 1762. The management was entrusted to him for se¬ veral years 3 and its success has exceeded the most san¬ guine expectations which were formed of it. The plan itself, now sufficiently known, it is unnecessary to ex¬ plain minutely. But it is mentioned here, because Dr Henry was accustomed in the last years of bis life to speak of this institution with peculiar affection, and {a reflect on its progress and utility with that kind of sa¬ tisfaction which a good man can only receive from “ the labour of love and of good works.” It was probably about the year 1763 that he first conceived the idea of his History of Great Britain : a work already established in the public opinion ; and which will certainly be regarded by posterity, not only as a book which lias greatly enlarged the sphere of hi¬ story, and gratifies our curiosity on p variety of sub¬ jects which fall not within the limits prescribed by pre¬ ceding historians, but as one of the most accurate and authentic repositories of historical information which tliis country has produced. The plan adopted by Dr Henry, which is indisputably bis own, and its pecu¬ liar advantages, are sufficiently explained in bis general preface. In every period, it arranges, under separate beads or chapters, the civil and military history of Great Britain ; the history of religion 3 the history of our constitution, government, laws, and courts of ju¬ stice 3 the history of learning, of learned men, and of the chief seminaries of learning 3 the history of arts ; the history of commerce, of shipping, of money or coin, and of the price of commodities 3 and the history of HEN ' [ 393 ] HEN enry. of manners, virtues, vices, customs, language, dress, -Y*""—^ diet, and amusements. Under these seven heads, which extend the province of an historian greatly beyond its usual limits, every thing curious or interesting in the history of any country may be comprehended. But it certainly required more than a common share of li¬ terary courage to attempt on so large a scale a subject so intricate and extensive as the history of Britain from the invasion of Julius Caesar.

"HER [ 429 ] HER cula. But little progress was made in tlie excavations till am. Charles infant of Spain ascended the Neapolitan throne j v—by whose unwearied efforts and liberality a very con¬ siderable part of Herculaneum has been explored, and such treasures of antiquity drawn out as form the most curious museum in the world. It being too arduous a task to attempt removing the covering, the king contented himself with cutting galleries to the princi¬ pal buildings, and causing the extent of one or two of them to be cleared. Of these the theatre is the most considerable. On a ballustrade which divided the or¬ chestra from the stage was found a row of statues ; and, on each side of the pulpitum, the equestrian figure of a person of the Nonia family. They are now placed under porticoes of the palace ; and from the great rarity of equestrian statues in marble would be very valuable objects, were their workmanship e.ven less ex¬ cellent than it is : one of them in particular is a very fine piece of sculpture. Since the king of Spain left Naples, the digging has been continued, but with less spirit and expenditure : indeed the collection of curio¬ sities brought out of Herculaneum and Pompeii is al¬ ready so considerable, that a relaxation of zeal and activity becomes excusable. They are now arranged in a wing of the palace ; and consist not only of statues, busts, altars, inscriptions, and other ornamental ap¬ pendages of opulence and luxury ; but also comprehend an entire assortment of the domestic, musical, and chi- rurgical instruments used by the ancients $ tripods of elegant form and exquisite execution, lamps in endless variety, vases and basons of noble dimensions, chande¬ liers of the most beautiful shapes, pateras and other appurtenances of sacrifice, looking-glasses of polish¬ ed metal, coloured glass, so hard, clear, and well stained, as to appear emeralds, sapphires, and other precious stones j a kitchen completely fitted up with copper-pans lined with silver, kettles, cisterns for heat¬ ing water, and every utensil necessary for culinary purposes $ specimens of various sorts of combustibles, retaining their form though burnt to a cinder j corn, bread, fish, oil, wine, and flour j a lady’s toilet, fully furnished with combs, thimbles, rings, paint, ear¬ rings, &c.

"Of all these, one generally called the Theban Hercules, is the most celebrated ; and to him, as may easily be imagined, the actions of the others have been attribu¬ ted. He is reported to have been the son of Jupiter by Alcmena (wife to Amphitryon king of Argos), whom Jupiter enjoyed in the shape of her husband while he was absent; and in order to add the greater strength to the child, made that amorous night as long as three. Amphitryon having soon after accidentally killed his uncle and father-in-law Electryon, was oblig¬ ed to fly to Thebes, where Hercules was born. The jealousy of Juno, on account of her husband’s amour with Alcmena, prompted her to destroy the infant. For this purpose she sent two serpents to kill him in the cradle, but young Hercules strangled them both. He was early instructed in the liberal arts, and Castor the son of Tyndarus taught him how to fight, Eurytus how to shoot with a bow and arrows, Autolicus to drive a chariot, Linus to play on the lyre, and Eumolpus to sing. He, like the rest of his illustrious contemporaries, , soon after became the pupil of the centaur Chiron, and under him he perfected and rendered himself the most valiant and accomplished of the age. In the 18th year of his age he resolved to deliver the neighbourhood of Mount Cithreron from a huge lion which preyed on the flocks of Amphitryon his supposed father, and which laid waste the adjacent country. He went to the court of Thespius king of Thespis, who shared in the general calamity ; and he received here a tender treatment, and was entertained during 50 days. The 50 daughters of the king became mothers by Hercules during HER [ 430 ] , HER Hercules, during his stay at Thespis, and some say that it was et-  v—fected in one night.

"1. The crown is in general hereditary, or descend¬ ible to the next heir, on the death or demise of the last proprietor. All regal governments must be either he¬ reditary or elective: and as there is no instance where¬ in the crown of England has ever been asserted to be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled trial of King Charles I.; it must of con¬ sequence be hereditary. Yet in thus asserting an he¬ reditary right, a jure divino title to the throne is by no means intended. Such a title may be allowed to have subsisted under the theocrative establishments of the children of Israel in Palestine ; but it never yet subsist¬ ed in any other country ; save only so far as kingdoms, like other human fabrics, are subject to the general and ordinary dispensations of Providence. Nor indeed have njure divino and an hereditary right any necessary connection with each other; as some have very weakly imagined. The titles of David and Jehu were equally jure divino as those of either Solomon or Ahab ; and yet David slew the sons of his predecessor, and Jelm his predecessor himself. And when our kings have the same warrant as they had, whether it be to sit upon the throne of their fathers, or to destroy the house of the preceding sovereign, they will then, and not before, possess the crown of England by a right like theirs, immediately derived from heaven. The hereditary right, which the laws of England acknowledge, owe# its origin to the founders of our constitution, and to them only. It has no relation to, nor depends upon, the civil laws of the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, or any other nation upon earth ; the municipal law# of one society having no connection with, or influence upon, the fundamental polity of another. The found¬ ers of our English monarchy might perhaps, if they had thought proper, have made it an elective mo¬ narchy ; but they rather chose, and upon good rea¬ son, to establish originally a succession by inheritance","Palestine, Providence, David, David","US,PA,IL,UK",6,"United States,Panama,Israel,N/A","North America,North America,Asia,N/A"

"HESIOD, a very ancient Greek poet; but whether cotemporary with Homer, or a little older or younger than him, is not yet agreed among the learned ; nor is there light enough in antiquity to settle the matter ex¬ actly. His father, as he tells us in his Opera et Dies, was an inhabitant of Cumte, one of the Lolian isles, now called Taio Nova; and removed from thence to Ascra, a little village of Boeotia, at the foot of Mount Helicon, where Hesiod was probably born, and called, as he often is, Ascrceus, from it. Of what quality his father was, is nowhere said; but that he was driven by his misfortunes from Cumae to Ascra, Hesiod himself informs us. His father seems to have prospered better at Ascra than he did in his own country ; yet Hesiod could arrive at no higher fortune than keeping sheep on the top of Mount Helicon. Here the muses met with him, and entered him into their service: Erewhile as they the shepherd swain behold, Feeding beneath the sacred mount his fold, With love of charming song his breast they fir’d, There me the heav’nly muses first inspir’d; There, when the maids of Jove the silence broke, To Hesiod thus, the shepherd swain, they spoke, &c",Of,"TR,GR",6,"Turkey,Greece","Asia,Europe"

It is a matter at this time quite undecided here 5 nor have I heard or observed any very conclusive reason to suppose that the fly makes its way generally into barns and ricks. A very intel¬ ligent farmer in the county of Bucks, informed me that it was the prevailing opinion there, and so I found it, that the flv did not, either in the field or in the mow, affect the grain of the wheat: a neighbour of his, in threshing the little wheat he had saved last har¬ vest, observed the fly rise from the straw in great num¬ bers wherever it was struck by the flail ; but though it was at first presumed that the fly had insinuated it¬ self into the mow for the purpose of depositing its eggs in the grain or in the straw, no trace of the egg could be discovered from the appearance of any mucus or dust, either in the grain or in the straw; hence it was inferred that all the mischief was done in the field.” HESA CHIUS, the most celebrated of all the an¬ cient Greek grammarians whose works are now extant, ■was a Christian j and, according to some, the same with Hesychius patriarch of Jerusalem, who died in 639.

"The Hidalgos claim a descent from those valiant sol¬ diers who retired into Castile, and the mountains of Asturias, and other remote parts of Spain, on the in¬ vasion of the Moors, where having fortified themselves, they successively descended into the plains, in propor¬ tion to the success of their arms $ from the notoriety of their persons, or the lands they became possessed of, they acquired the appellation of Hidalgos notorios, Hi¬ dalgos de solar conocido, or de casa solariega. Of these, according to Hernando Mexia, there are three sorts ; the first being lords of places, villages, towns, or castles, from whence they took their surnames, as the Guzmans, Mendozas, Laras, Guivras, and others ; the second, who recovered any fortress from the Moors, as the Ponces ol Leon, and others; and the third sort from the places where they resided, or held jurisdiction, as Rodrigo de Navarez was called of Antequara, from being alcayde there. But this definition is not considered as exact or conclusive by Otalora, another civilian, who says that the true meaning of Hidalgos de solar conocido is explained by the laws of Castile to be a well known mansion or possession, the nature of which is particularly explained in the laws oi Parditas, lib. v. tit. 35. which describe three sorts of tenures, called Devisa, Solariega, and Behetria. By the first, lands are devised by the ancestor ; solar is a tenure upon another person’s manor, and obliges the owner to receive the lord of the fee when necessity obliges him to travel ; and Behetria is in the nature of an allo¬ dium. In proportion as these Aborigines gained ground on the Moors, and increased in their numbers, many private persons distinguished themselves by their valour, and obtained testimonies of their services called cartas de mcrced, which served them as a foundation of their birth and good descent, without which documents their posterity could not make it appear; and if from a lapse of time, or other unavoidable accidents, such proof should happen to be lost or destroyed, the law affords them a remedy under these circumstances, by a declaration importing, that such persons as are sup¬ posed to have had such certificates, may be relieved by making it appear that their ancestors, time imme- H I D morial, have always been held and reputed as Hidal- Hidalgo, gos, and enjoyed the privileges of such, form a strong —y— presumption in their favour; the possession of land having equal force to any other document; which is fully set forth in the Pragmatica of Cordova. To these executory letters are granted, cartas executorias, ex¬ pressive of their privileges; and for the better regu¬ lation of these matters, proper officers are appointed in the chancery courts, called alcaldes de lor hidalgos, who ought to be hidalgos themselves, and hold juris¬ diction in these cases, and no others ; but even here innovations have taken place ; for as these grants flow irom the sovereign, who is the fountain of honour, some are declared Hidalgos de sangre, by right of descent, and others de privilegio, or by office, in which the will of the sovereigns has made amends for any deficiency of blood","Of, Hidalgo, Cordova","ES,TR,MX,PH",6,"Spain,Turkey,Mexico,Philippines","Europe,Asia,North America,Asia"

"Hill, Aaron, a poet of considerable eminence, the son of a gentleman of Malmesbury-abbey in Wilt¬ shire, was born in 1685. His father’s imprudence having cut off his paternal inheritance, he left Westminster school at 14 years of age j and embarked for Constan¬ tinople, to visit Lord Paget the English ambassador there, who was his distant relation. Lord Paget recei¬ ved him with surprise and pleasure, provided him a tu¬ tor, and sent him to travel : by which opportunity he saw Egypt, Palestine, and a great part of the east; and returning home with his noble patron, visited most of the courts of Europe. About the year 1709, he pub¬ lished his first poem entitled Camillus, in honour of the earl of Peterborough who had been general in Spain j and being the same year made master of Drury-lane theatre, he wrote his first tragedy Elfred, or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master of the opera- house in the Hay-market $ when he wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which met with great success, being the first that Mr Handel set to music after he came to England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a pro¬ jector as well as poet, and in 17*5 obtained a patent for extracting oil from bcech-nuts ; which underta¬ king, whether good or bad, miscarried after engaging three years of his attention. He was also concerned in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia ; from which he never reaped any advantage ; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of Scotland, on a scheme of applying the woods there to ship-building 5 in which he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived in perfect harmony with all the writers of his time, except Mr Pope, with whom he had a short pa¬ per-war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the Dunciad, as one of the competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of Hulness, in the follow¬ ing lines: “ Then Hill essay’d $ scarce vanished out of sight, “ He buoys up instant, and returns to light ; “ He bears no token of the sabler streams, “ And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.’, This, though far the gentlest piece of satire in the whole poem, and conveying at the same time an oblique complimeat, roused Mr Hill to take some notice of it ; which he did by a poem written during his peregrina¬ tion in the north, entitled, “ The Progress of Wit, a Caveat for the use of an eminent writer which he begins with the following eight lines, in which Mr Pope’s too well known disposition is elegantly, yet very severely characterized : ** Tuneful Alexis on the Thames’ fair side, “ The Ladies play-thing, and the Muses pride j “ With merit popular, with wit polite, “ Easy tho’ vain, and elegant tho’ light} “ Desiring and deserving others praise, “ Poorly accepts a Fame he ne’er repays : “ Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves j “ And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves.” The sneakingly approves, in the last couplet, Mr Pope was much affected by; and indeed through their whole controversy afterwards, in which it was generally thought that Mr Hill had much the advantage, Mr Pope seems rather to express his repentance by denying the offence, than to vindicate himself supposing it to have been given. Besides the above poems, Mr Hill, among many others, wrote one, called The northern star, upon the actions of Czar Peter the Great; for which he was several years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from the empress Catharine, according to the Czar’s desire before his death. He likewise alter¬ ed some of Shakespeare’s plays, and translated some of Voltaire’s. His last production was Merope ; which was brought upon the stage in Drury-lane by Mr Gar¬ rick.

All these have distinct and separate offices, and cannot, according to their laws, intermingle with each other ; but for cer¬ tain offences they are subject to the loss of their cast, which is reckoned the highest punishment they can suffer ; and hence is formed a kind of fifth cast named Pariars on the coast of Coromandel, but in the Shan- scrit or sacred language Chitndalas. Ihese are esteem¬ ed the dregs of the people, and are never employed but in the meanest offices. There is besides a general division which pervades the four casts indiscriminately, and which is taken from the worship of their gods Vishsnou and Sheevah; the worshippers of the former being named Vishnou-bukht; of the latter Sheevah- hufc/it",Coromandel,"IN,BR,CN",6,"India,Brazil,China","Asia,South America,Asia"
"Of these four casts the Bramins are accounted the foremost in every respect ; and all the laws have such an evident partiality towards them, as cannot but in¬ duce us to suppose that they have had the principal hand in framing them. They are not, however, al¬ lowed to assume the sovereignty ; the religious cere¬ monies and the instruction of the people being their peculiar province. They alone are allowed to read the f^eda or sacred books; the Khatries, or cast next in dignity, being only allowed to hear them read ; while the other two can only read the Sastras or commenta¬ ries upon them. As for the poor Chandalas, they dare not enter a temple, or be present at any religious ceremony",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

The books are supposed to have been the work not of the supreme God himself, but ot an inferior deity named Brimha. They inform us, that Brama, or Brahma, the supreme God, having created the world by the word of his mouth, formed a female deity named Baivaney, who in the enthusiasm of joy and praise brought forth three eggs. From these were produced three male deities, named Brimha, VisJmou, and Sheevah. Brimha was endowed with the power of creating the things of this world, Vishnou with that of cherishing them, and Sheevah with that of re¬ straining and correcting them. Thus Brimha became the creator of man j and in this character he formed the four casts from different parts of his own body, the Bramins from his mouth, the Khatry from his arms, the Banians from his belly and thighs, and the Soodera from his feet. Hence, say they, these four different casts derive the different offices assigned them } the Brahmins to teach ; the Khatry to defend and go¬ vern j the Banians to enrich by commerce and agricul¬ ture j and the Soodera to labour, serve, and obey",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"4. Vishnou, the most celebrated of all the Indian deities, is supposed to fly or ride on the garoora, a kind of large brown kite, which is found in plenty in the neighbourhood ; and on which Vishnou is some¬ times represented as sitting; though at others he is represented on a serpent with a great number of differ¬ ent heads. At some of his temples the Bramins accustom all the birds they can find, of the species above mentioned, to come and be fed ; calling them by striking upon a brass plate. This deity is said to have had ten different incarnations to destroy the giants with which the earth was infested ; and in these he is represented in as many different figures, all of which are to the last degree fantastic and monstrous. His common form is that of a man with four hands, and a number of heads set round in a circle, supposed to be emblems of omniscience and omnipotence. In his first incarnation he is represented as coming out of the mouth of a fish, with several hands containing swords, &c. In another he has the head of a boar with mon¬ strous tusks, bearing a city in the air, and stands upon a vanquished giant with horns on his head. In others of his incarnations, he has the head of a horse or other animals, j f 32 H I N T 473 ] H I N [oos, animals, with a great number of arms brandishing r—' swords, &c",,IN,6,India,Asia

"Sometimes a chapel is erected on the place where one of those sacrifices has been performed ; sometimes it is inclosed, flowers planted upon it, and images set up.—- In some few places the Hindoos bury their dead $ and some women have been known to suffer themselves to be buried alive with their deceased husbands : but the instances of this are still more rare than those of burn¬ ing.—No woman is allowed any inheritance among the Hindoos ; so that if a man dies without male issue, his estate goes to his adopted son or to his nearest re¬ lation. *■ I2 The Hindoos, though naturally mild and timid, will Instances on many occasions meet death with the most heroic in-0^^ero’s<,t trepidity. An Hindoo who lies at the point °f will talk of his decease with the utmost composure j and if near the river Ganges, will desire to be carried out, that he may expire on its banks. Such is the ex¬ cessive veneration they have for their religion and cu¬ stoms, that no person will infringe them even to pre¬ serve his own life. An Hindoo, we are told, being ill of a putrid fever, was prevailed upon to send for an Eu¬ ropean physician, who prescribed him the bark in wine ; but this was refused with the greatest obstinacy even 3 0 2 'to H I N [ 476 ] H I h Hindoo?, to the very last, though the governor himself joined in ' ' liis solicitations, and in other matters had a considerable influence over him. In many instances these people, both in ancient and modern times, have been known, when closely besieged by an enemy whom they could not resist, to kill their wives and children, set fire to their houses, and then violently rush upon their adver¬ saries till every one was destroyed. Some seapoys, in the British service, having been concerned in a mu¬ tiny, were condemned to be blown away from the mouths of cannon. Of these some were grenadiers, who cried out, that as they had all along had the post of honour, they saw no reason why they should be denied it now 5 and therefore desired that they might be blown away first. This being granted, they walked forward to the guns with composure, begged that they might be spa¬ red the indignity of being tied, and, placing their breasts close to the muzzles, were shot away.

"The science for which the Bramins, however, were most remarkable, is that of astronomy j and in this their progress was so great, as even yet to furnish matter of admiration to the moderns.—The Europeans first be¬ came acquainted with the Indian astronomy in 1687, Hi„a0o«, from a Siamese MS. containing rules for calculating the ■ ^ < places of the sun and moon, brought home by M. Lou- bere the French ambassador at Siam. The principles on which the tables in this MS. were founded, however, proved to be so obscure, that it required the genius of Cassini to investigate them. The missionaries after¬ wards sent over two other sets of tables from Plindo- stan ; but no attention was paid to them till M. le Gen- til returned from observing the transit of Venus in 1769.

They divide the zodiac into 27 constellations, probably from the motion of the moon through it in 27 clays ; and to this lunar motion the Professor ascribes the general division of time into weeks, which has prevailed so universally throughout the world. The clays of the week were de¬ dicated to the planets, as by the ancient heathens of the west,, and in precisely the same order. The eclip¬ tic is divided into signs, degrees, and minutes, as with us : and indeed their calculations are entirely sexage¬ simal, the day and night being divided into 60. hours ; so that each of their hours is only 24 of our minutes, and each of their minutes 24 of our second'-",Of,"TR,IN",6,"Turkey,India","Asia,Asia"
"The requisites for calculating by the Indian tables are, 1. An observation of the celestial body, in some past moment of time, which is commonly called the Epoch of the tables. 2. The mean rate of the pla¬ net’s motion. 3. The correction on account of the irregular motion of the body, to be added or subtract¬ ed from the mean place, according to circumstances",,IN,6,India,Asia
"The motions of the moon are deduced from a cycle of 19 years; during which she makes nearly 235 revo¬ lutions; and which period constitutes the famous cycle supposed to have been invented by Meton the Athe¬ nian astronomer, and from him called the Metonic Cy¬ cle. They are likewise surprisingly exact in calcula¬ ting H I N [ 478 ] H I N Hindoos, ting the moon’s apogee and some of the inequalities of jier motion j they know the apparent motion of the fixed stars eastward, and the Siamese tables make it only four seconds too quick j which still shows a great accuracy of calculation, as Ptolemny the celebrated astronomer made an error of no less than 14 seconds in calculating the same thing. M. Cassini, however, in¬ forms us, that these tables are not calculated lor the me¬ ridian of Siam, but for a place 180 ^ to the west¬ ward of it, which brings us very near the meridian^ of Benares, the ancient seat of Indian learning. . rLhis likewise agrees with what the Hindoos call their first meridian, which passes through Ceylon, and the banks of the river Remananur. It must be observed, how¬ ever, that the geography of the Hindoos is much more inaccurate than their astronomy",,IN,6,India,Asia
"2. By calculation from our modern tables, it appears that the place of the star Aldebaran, at the commence¬ ment of the Calyougham, differs only 53' from what the Indian tables make it. He thinks this coincidence the more remarkable, as the Bramins, by reason of the inaccuracy of their own date, would have erred by four or five degrees, had they calculated from their most modern tables dated in 1491* 3. At the commencement of this epoch (which ac¬ cording to M. Bailly, happened at midnight between the 17th and 18th of February 3102 B. C.) the sun was in 10s 30 38' 13"" by the Indian tables. But the mean longitude of the sun, according to the tables of M. de la Caille, for the same time, comes out to be only 10s l° 5' 57"", supposing the precession of the equinoxes to have been the same at that time as now. M. de la Grange, however, has demonstrated, that, in former ages, the precession of the equinoxes was less than at present: whence there arises an equa¬ tion of l° 45' 22"" to be added to the sun’s place al¬ ready mentioned : and thus it will differ only 47 from the radical place in the tables of Trivalore. Notwith¬ standing this reasoning, however, Mr Playfair thinks that no stress is to be laid upon this argument, as it de¬ pends on the truth of a conjecture of M. Bailly that the place of the sun above mentioned was not the mean but the true one",,IN,6,India,Asia
"4. The mean place of the moon at Benares, calcula¬ ted from Mr Mayer’s tables, for the 18th of February 3102 B. C. will be 10s o° 51' 16"", provided her mo¬ tion had all that time been equable : but the same astro¬ nomer informs us, that the motion of the moon is sub¬ ject to a small but uniform acceleration, about 9"" in 100 years ; which, in an interval of 4801 years, must have amounted to 50 45' 44""; which added to the preceding, gives 10s 6° 37' for the true place of the moon at the commencement of the Calyougham. Now the place of this luminary, at that time, by the tables of Trivalore, is 108 6® ; the difference is less than two- thirds of a degree, which, for so remote a period, and considering the acceleration of the moon’s motion, for which no allowance could be made in an Indian calcu¬ lation, is a degree of accuracy that nothing but actual observation could have produced.—This conclusion is confirmed by a computation of the moon’s place from all the tables to which the Indians could have any ac¬ cess, and of which the enormous errors would instantly show the deception. Thus, by the tables of Ptolemy, the place of the sun would be 10° 2l' 15"" greater; and that of the moon 11° 52' 7"" greater than has just been found from the Indian tables. By those of Ulug Beg, the place of the sun would be 1° 30', and that of the moon 6°, different from what it is by the Indian tables; and in like manner our author shows that the Indian calculations could not be derived from any other set of tables extant. In like manner, he shows that, with re¬ gard to the mean place of the moon, there is a coinci¬ dence for a period of more than 4000 years between the tables of Mayer and those of India named Chnsnu- bouram ; which, though they bear a more modern date than those ofTrivalorej are thus probably more ancient",,IN,6,India,Asia
"5. Since the time that M. Bailly wrote, every argu¬ ment respecting the acceleration of the moon’s motion has become more worthy of attention, and more con¬ clusive. For that acceleration is no longer a mere em¬ pirical equation introduced to reconcile the ancient ob¬ servations with the modern, nor a fact that can only be accounted for by hypothetical causes, such as the resist¬ ance of the ether, or the time necessary for the trans¬ mission of gravity ; but a phenomenon which M. de la Place has with great ability deduced from the principle of universal gravitation, and shown to be necessarily connected with the changes of eccentricity in the earth’s orbit discovered by M. de la Grange : so that the ac¬ tion of the moon is indirectly produced by the action of the planets, which alternately increasing and dimi¬ nishing this eccentricity, subjects the moon to different degrees of that force by which the sun disturbs the time of her revolution round the earth. It is there¬ fore a periodical inequality, by which the moon’s mo¬ tion, in the course of ages, will be as much retarded as accelerated j but its changes are so slow, that her motion has been constantly accelerated, even for a much longer period than that to which the observations of India extend. To M. de la Grange also we are in¬ debted for one of the most beautiful of the discoveries in physical astronomy, viz. That all the variations in our system are periodical; so that, though every thing, almost without exception, be subject to change, it will, after a certain interval, return to the same state in which it is at present, and leave no room for the intro¬ duction of disorder, or of any irregularity that might constantly increase. Many of these periods, however, are of vast duration. A great number of ages, for in¬ stance, must elapse, before the year be exactly of the same length, or the sun’s equation be of the same mag¬ nitude, as at present. An astronomy, therefore, which professes to be so ancient as the Indian, ought to differ considerably from ours in many of its elements. If, in¬ deed, these diflerences are irregular, they arc the ef¬ fects of chance, and must be accounted errors j but if they observe the laws which theory informs us they do, they must be held as the most undoubted marks of au¬ thenticity",,IN,6,India,Asia
"6. Neither these tables of Trivalore, nor the more ancient ones of Chrisnabouram, are those of the greatest antiquity in India. The Bramins constantly refer to an astronomy at Benares, which they emphatically style the ancient; and which, they say, is not now understood by them, though they believe it to be much more accu- ^ rate than that by which they calculate, lay. From these and other similar arguments, Mr PIp.yfair •on- draws the following conclusions with respect to Indian ''S die astronomy. 1. The observations on which it is founded, 10m Were ma,^e more tlian 3000 years before the Christian ’ era j and, in particular, the places of the sun and moon, at the beginning of the Calyougham, were de- 2. Though the astro- Hindoo^, nomy now in the hands of the Bramins is so ancient in its origin, yet it contains many rules and tables that are of later construction. 3. The basis of their four systems of astronomical tables is evidently the same. 4. T he construction of these tables implies a great knowledge of geometry, arithmetic, and even the theoretical part 21 of astronomy. All this, however, we find controvert-conU'°Te,t* ed, or at least rendered somewhat doubtful, by William Marsden, Eeq. who has written a paper on the chrono-‘ logy of the Hindoos, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1790. “ The Kalee Yoog (says he), or principal chronological era, began in the year 3x02 B. C. ac¬ cording to the common method of computation, or in 3101 according to the astronomical method, on the 18th of February, at sunrise j or at midnight, accord¬ ing to different accounts, under their first meridian of Lanka. At that period it is said to be asserted by their astronomers, that the sun, moon, and all the planets, were in conjunction according to their mean places",,IN,6,India,Asia

Of this a most remarkable instance is given by Mr Playfair, in their finding out the proportion of the circumference of a circle to its diameter to a great degree of accuracy. This is deter¬ mined, in the Ayeen Akbery, to be as 3927 to 1250, and which, to do it arithmetically in the simplest man¬ ner possible, would require the inscription of a polygon of 768 sides ; an operation which cannot be performed without the knowledge ol some very curious properties of the circle, and at least nine extractions of the square root, each as far as ten places of decimals. This pro¬ portion of 1250 to 3927 is the same with that of 1 to 3.1416; and differs very little from that of 113 to 355 discovered by Metrus. He and Vieta were the first who surpassed the accuracy of Archimedes in the so¬ lution of this problem ; and it is remarkable that these two mathematicians flourished at the very time that the Ayeen Akbery was composed among the Hindoos.

The dole is a long nay-row drum slung round the neck ; and the tam-tam is a flat kind of drum resembling a tabor, but larger and louder. They use also the cymbal, which they name talan ; and they have various sorts of trumpets, particularly a great one named tai'y, which emits a most doleful sound, and is always used at funerals, and sometimes to announce the death of persons of distinc- tion. _ > ,s The jugglers among the Hindoos are so expert, that Juggler many of the missionaries have ascribed their tricks toand *»- supernatural power; and even so late a traveller asc^anler Mr Grose seems to be not of a very different opinion !

They take the serpents, though of the most poisonous kinds, out of the bags with their naked hands, and throw them on the ground, where they are taught to rear and move about to the sound of their music. They say that this is accomplish¬ ed by means of certain incantatiens. ^ , The use of fire-arms appears to have been of great Antiqu antiquity in India. They are prohibited by the code()^iC : f of Gentoo laws, which is certainly of a vefy ancientamon'’ date. The phrase by which they are denominated is agneeaster, or weapons of fire ; and there is also men¬ tion mode of shet-agnee, or the weapon that kills an hundred men at once. It is impossible to guess at the time when those weapons were invented among the Hindoos ; but we are certain, that in many places ol the east, which have neither been frequented by Mo¬ hammedans nor Europeans, rockets are almost univer¬ sally made use of as weapons of war. The Plindoo book's themselves ascribe the invention of fire-arms to JSaeshkookerma, who formed all the weapons made use of in a war betwixt the good and evil spirits.

"HINDUSTAN, a celebrated and extensive coun¬ try of Asia, hounded on the north by Great and Little Thibet; on the south, by the hither peninsula of In¬ dia, part of the Indian sea, and bay of Bengal; on the west, by Persia ; and on the east, by Thibet, and the farther peninsula. It is situated between 84° and 102° of east longitude, and between 21° and 36° of north latitude ; being in length about 1204 miles, and in breadth 560; though in some places much less. i This country was in early times distinguished among Derivatioa the Greeks by the name of India, the most probableof lhe derivation of which is from Hind the Persian name.Darae‘ We are assured by Mr Wilkins, that no such words as Hindoo or Hindostan exist in the Sanscrit or learned language of the country ; in which it is named Bharata, a word totally unknown to Europeans. The first ac¬ counts we have of Hindostan are from Herodotus, who lived 113 years before the expedition of Alexan- z der the Great.

He informs us, that Darius Hystaspes, about 508 B. C. had sent Scylax of Caryandra to explore the river Indus. He set sail from Caspatyrus, a town near the source of the Indus, and the territories of Pactya (which Major Rennel sup¬ poses to be the modern Pchkely}, and continued his course eastward to the sea ; then altering his course to the west, he arrived at that place where the Phoenicians had formerly sailed round the continent of Africa; af¬ ter which Darius subdued the Indians, and became ma¬ ster of that sea.

"The Grecian expedition into India soon excited a general curiosity in the Europeans to become ac¬ quainted with a country so wealthy and so remote. Me- gasthenes, the ambassador of Seleucus, resided long at Palihothra the capital of an Indian nation, and from him the ancient writers learned most of what they knew concerning that part of the world. He lived about 300 years before the Christian era, and kept a journal during the time he resided in India",,IN,6,India,Asia
"For some short time the western provinces of India continued subject to the Syrian empire founded by Se¬ leucus ; but he quickly ceded these distant countries to one Sandrocottus, who gave him only 500 elephants in exchange. Soon after this the province of Bac- tria likewise became independent; and thus the con-> nection betwixt India and the western parts of the world y— was entirely dissolved, and we are almost entirely igno¬ rant of the transactions of that country till the time of the Mohammedan conquest. That the extensive country we now c&\\Hindostan was divided among many different nations, we have no reason to doubt ; hut Major Ren¬ nel is of opinion, that however this might be the case, there was generally a large empire or kingdom, which occupied the principal part of that immense valley through which the Ganges takes its course ; the capi¬ tal of which has fluctuated between Delhi and Patna, as the limits of the empire have varied. This was named the kingdom of the Prasij or Gangaridce in the times of Alexander and Megasthenes. Major Rennel is of opinion that it extended westward to the Panjab country ; and he also thinks it probable that the capi¬ tal named Palibothra stood on the same spot which is now occupied by the city of Patna. The kingdom, according to this supposition, would occupy part of Bengal ; and he thinks that it could not be less than that of France. It was on the borders of this king¬ dom that Alexander’s army mutinied and refused to proceed any farther. Arrian informs us, that the people were rich, excellent soldiers, and good husbandmen ; that they were governed by nobility, and that their rulers imposed nothing harsh upon them. ^ The Hindoos themselves pretend to an extravagant No ancle antiquity ; but we are informed by Major Rennel, that®IB^00J “ there is no known history of Hindostan (that rests on the foundation of Hindoo materials or records) ex¬ tant before the period of the Mohammedan conquests ; for either the Hindoos kept no regular histories, or they were all destroyed, or secluded from common eyes by the Pundits. We may judge of their traditions by that existing concerning Alexander’s expedition ; which is, that he fought a great battle with the emperor of H indostan near Delhi, and though victorious, retired to Persia across the northern mountains ; so that the remarkable circumstance of his sailing down the Indus, in which he employed many months, is sunk altoge¬ ther.

"The only traces of Indian history we meet with are in the Persian historians. In the beginning of the 17th century, Mohammed Ferishta composed a history of Hindostan, most of which was given in that of Colonel Dow, published upwards of 30 years ago ; hut with regard to the early part of it, Major Rennel is of opinion that it cannot at all he depended upon. ®_ The authentic history of Hindostan commences with Expfd'11 the conquests of Mahmud or Mahmood Gazni, a^0U^u(jG»‘ the year loco. His kingdom had arisen out of that.nMjnj of the Saracens, who under the caliph A1 Walid had extended their conquests immensely both to the east and west. Mahmud was the third from Abistagi, » governor of Khorasan, who had revolted from the king of Buckharia. He possessed great part cf that coun¬ try formerly known by the name of Bactria.

His first invasion took place in the year 1000 j during which he made no farther progress than the province of Moultan. That part of the country was inhabited by the Kuttry and Rajpoot tribe, the Malli and Gather! of Alexander, who still retained their ancient spirit, and made a very stout resistance to the armies of that furious enthusiast",Balkh,"IN,AF",6,"India,Afghanistan","Asia,Asia"
"As he was prompted to this undertaking no less by a desire of exterminating the Hindoo religion than by that of conquest, a league was at last formed against him among all the Indian princes from the banks of the Ganges to the Nerbudda. Their allied forces, however, were defeated, and the year 1008 was mark¬ ed by the destruction of the famous temple of Nagra- cut in the Panjab country. Having satiated himself with plunder on this occasion, Mahmud returned to his own country $ but in ion invaded Hindostan once more, destroying Tanafar a city on the west of Delhi, and a more celebrated place of worship than Nagracut itself. Delhi was reduced on this occasion ; and in seven years after Canoge was taken ; the temples of Matra or Methura, the Methora of Pliny, a city of great antiquity, and remarkable for a place of worship near Agra, were likewise demolished ; but he failed in his attempts on the Rajpoots of Agimere, either through their own valour or the strength of their country. His twelfth expedition took place in the year 1024, when he destroyed the celebrated temple of Sumnaut in the peninsula of Guzerat, adjoining to the city of Puttan on the sea-coast, and not far from the island of Diu, now in the hands of the Portuguese. In this expedi¬ tion he proved very successful, reducing the whole peninsula of Guzerat, with many cities, the temples of which he constantly destroyed j and indeed seemed no less pleased with the overthrow of the Hindoo religion than with the conquest of the country. At his death, which happened in 1028, he was possessed of the east¬ ern and by far the largest part of Persia, and nominal¬ ly of all the provinces from the western part of the Ganges to the peninsula of Guzerat ; as well as those lying between the Indus and the mountains of Agi¬ mere j but the Rajpoots in that country still preserved their independency, which they have done all along, 7 even to the present time","Delhi, Delhi, Diu","IN,PT",6,"India,Portugal","Asia,Europe"
"After his death in 1205, the empire of Gazna was again divided ; and the Patan or Afghan empire was founded by Cuttub, who had the Indian part, the Per¬ sian remaining to Eldoze. Cuttub fixed his imperial residence at Delhi j and in 1210 the greatest part of Hindostan Proper was conquered bv the emperor Al- tumish, the successor of Cuttub. After his time the government of Bengal was always bestowed upon one of the reigning emperor’s sons j and during his reign the bloody conqueror Jenghiz Khan put an end to the other branch of the Gaznian empire, known by the name of IC/iarasm ; of which revolution an account is given under the article Gazna ; but Hindostan was at S that time left undisturbed. In 1242 the Moguls began inTa- to make irruptions into Hindostan, but did not at thissioB of the time make any permanent conquest. The country was now in much the same state in which it had been before the invasion of the Mohammedans, viz. divided into a great number of states tributary to the empe¬ ror, but in a great measure independent ; and which did not fail to revolt whenever a favourable opportu¬ nity offered. The kingdom of Malwa, which had been reduced by Cuttub in 1205, shook off the yoke in the year 1265, and the Rajpoots were on every oc¬ casion ready to revolt, notwithstanding that their coun¬ try lay in the neighbourhood of the capital. The most dreadful massacres, rebellions, and confusion^ now took place, which, from that period almost to the time that the British government commenced, made up the history of Hindostan. I he empire being parcelled out among a set of rapacious governors, the people were reduced to the last degree of misery, and were at last so far misled as to imagine that it was their interest to take up arms, in order to render tliese governors in¬ dependent. Had the emperors of Hindostan consulted their true interest, they would have given up the pro¬ vinces which lay beyond the upper part of the Indus and the deserts of Agimere ; as these formed a bar¬ rier which could not easily be passed by any invader",Delhi,"IN,AF,GB",6,"India,Afghanistan,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Europe"

Alla, having accomplished his undertaking, during f which he amassed an incredible quantity of treasure, deposed and murdered the emperor, assuming to him¬ self the sovereignty of Hindostan. He then began a new plan of conquest; and the first instance of his suc¬ cess was the reduction of Guzerat, a strong fortress, which had hitherto remained independent, and, while it continued so, was a strong obstacle to his designs upon the Deccan. He next reduced Rantanpour and Cheitore, two of the strongest forts in the Rajpoot country. In 1303 the city of Warangole, capital of a kingdom of the Deccan named Tellingana, was re¬ duced $ but in the midst of these conquests the Moguls invaded the country from an opposite quarter, and plun¬ dered the suburbs of Delhi. Notwithstanding this check the emperor resumed his plan of conquest j the remainder of Malwa was subdued } and in 1306 the conquest of the Deccan was again undertaken. The conduct of the war was now committed to Cafoor j who not only carried his army into Dowlatabad, but, in 1310, penetrated into the Carnatic also. Ihe ex¬ tent of his conquests in that country is not known ; and indeed his expeditions seem to have been made with a view rather to plunder than to achieve any permanent conquest. The quantity of riches he amassed was so great, that the soldiers are said to have carried away only the gold, leaving silver behind them as too cum¬ bersome.

In the beginning of the year 1399 he was met by the Indian army, whom he defeated with great slaughter, and soon after made himself master of the imperial city of Delhi. At this time the capital con¬ sisted of three cities, named Old Delhi, Seyri, and Je- han Denali. Seyri was surrounded with a wall in the form of a circle j and Old Delhi was the same, but much larger, lying to the south-west of the other",Delhi,IN,6,India,Asia
"These two were joined on each side by a wall: and the third, which was larger than the other two, lay be¬ tween them. As the city made no resistance, there could not be a pretence for using the inhabitants with any cruelty: and thus matters passed on quietly till the 12th of January, when the Tartar soldiers insulted some of the inhabitants at one of the gates. The Emirs were ordered to put a stop to these disorders, but found it impossible. The Sultanas, having a curiosity to see the rarities of Delhi, and particularly a famous palace adorned with 1000 pillars built by an ancient Indian king, went in with all the court $ and the gate being thus left open for every body, above 15,000 soldiers got in unperceived. But there was a far larger number of troops in a place between the cities above mention¬ ed, who committed such disorders, that an insurrection commenced j some of the inhabitants attacking them, while others, in despair, set fire to their houses, and burnt themselves with their wives and children. The soldiers, taking advantage of this confusion, pillaged the houses j while the disorder was augmented by the admission of more troops, who seized the inhabitants of the neighbouring cities that had fled to Delhi for shelter. The Emirs caused the gates to be shut j but they were quickly opened by the soldiers, who rose in arms against their officers j so that, by the morning of the next day, the whole army had entered, and the city was totally destroyed. Some soldiers carried off no fewer than 150 slaves, men, women, and children 5 nay, some of their boys had 20 slaves a-piece to their share.

He did not, however, disturb the succession to the throne, but left Mahmud in quiet possession of it, reserving to himself only that of the Panjab country. The death of Mahmud, which hap¬ pened in 1413, put an end to what is called the Patan dynasty, founded by Cuttub in 1205. He was suc¬ ceeded by Chizer, who derived hi§ pedigree from the impostor Mohammed, and his posterity continued to enjoy it till the year 1450 $ when Belloli, an Afghan of the tribe of Lodi, took possession of it, the reigning prince Alla H. having abdicated the government. Un¬ der him all Hindostan was divided into separate states; and a prince, whose title was the king of the east, who resided at Jionpour in the province of Allahabad, became so formidable, that the king of Delhi had only a shadow of authority remaining to him. A consi¬ derable part of the empire, however, was recovered by the son of Belloli ; who, in the year 1501, fixed his royal residence at Agra. During his reign the Portu¬ guese first accomplished the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, but they had no connection with any other part of Hindostan than some maritime places in the Deccan which had always been independent of the court of Delhi.

"This year Mohammed Shah died, after a reign of 29 years ; which, considering the fate of his immediate predecessors, and the anarchy universally prevalent throughout Hindostan, must be accounted very won¬ derful. He was succeeded by his son Ahmed Shah ; during whose reign, which lasted about six years, the total division of the remainder of the empire took place. Nothing now remained to the family of Ta¬ merlane but a small tract of territory round the city of Delhi, now no longer a capital, and exposed to the re¬ peated depredations of invaders, with consequent mas¬ sacres and famines. The last army which could with propriety be termed imperial, was defeated by the Ro- hillas in 1749 > ^7 vvhich their independence was fully established in the eastern parts of the province of Del¬ hi. The Jauts, or Jats, a Hindoo tribe, established themselves in the province of Agra ; the Deccan and Bengal were seized upon by their viceroys, Nizam and Aliverdy. Oude was seized on by Seifdar Jang (fa¬ ther to the late Sujah Dowlah) ; Allahabad by Moham¬ med Kooli. Malwa was divided between the Poonah Mabrattas and several native princes and zemindars : Agimere reverted of course to its ancient lords, the Raj¬ poot princes j and the Mahrattas, in addition to their proper share of Malwa, possessed the greatest part of Guzerat, Berar, and Orissa ; besides their ancient do¬ minions in the Deccan.

Ibis country, ex¬ tending all the way betwixt India and Persia, is known by the name of Duran, or Turan ; and was possessed by the Afghans, of whom Abdallah became the sove¬ reign. He was descended from an illustrious family ; and having the misfortune of being taken prisoner by Hussein Khan, then chief of Candahar, along with bis brother Zulfecur Khan, they were released by the celebrated Nadir Shah in his passage through that country to Hindostan j but as that conqueror still looked upon them with a jealous eye on account of their great influence with their countrymen, both were sent to Mazandaran in Persia. Here Zulfecur Khan, the brother of Ahmed, died ; and, some time after, we find the latter promoted to the command of a body of Afghan cavalry in the Persian army. He continued attached to the interests of Nadir while that conqueror lived; and even attempted, though ineffectually, to revenge his death. Proving unsuccessful in this at¬ tempt, he returned to his own country *, and, arriving at Candahar, was saluted chief of the Afghans. In the course of a few months he became master of all the countries which the Mogul had been obliged to cede to Nadir Shah ; and, encouraged by the distracted state of the affairs of Hindostan at that time, he crossed the Indus, and plundered the country to the south¬ east. An indecisive battle fought with the Indian army under the command of the prince royal and vizier, in which the latter was killed, obliged Ahmed to return to his own territories j but he soon undertook another expedition, in which he conquered the pro¬ vince of Lahore. In 1755 he returned j and after staying some time at Lahore, marched to Delhi the capital, having been invited thither, as was supposed, by the.Mogul himself, in order to get rid of the ty¬ ranny of his vizier. The latter was accordingly de¬ serted in a battle by orders of the emperor, and obli¬ ged to surrender himself prisoner 5 but instead of be¬ ing put to death, he had the address to ingratiate himself with the conqueror j and the unfortunate Al- lumghire, the Mogul, was obliged to submit to be ruled by him as before^ Ahmed took care to indem¬ nify himself for his trouble, by laying the city of Delhi under a heavy contribution j and having staid for about a month, during which time he concluded a marriage betwixt his son Timur and the emperor’s niece, he marched against a tribe of Hindoos named the Jauts, and conquered the greatest part of the province of Agra. In this expedition he surprised the city of Matra, famous for being the birth-place of Krishen, the Apollo of the Hindoos j and sacrificed to the Gopia, the muses of the country. He failed in his attempt to surprise Agra through the resolution of Fazil Cawn the governor •, after which he led back his troops to Delhi, where he married the daughter of Mohammed Shah the late emperor, whom Allumghire had in vain solicited for himself","Lahore, Lahore, Delhi, Delhi, Delhi","IN,PK,AF",6,"India,Pakistan,Afghanistan","Asia,Asia,Asia"
"Having settled his sou Timur in the government of 3 Lahore, Ahmed quitted Hindustan, and returned to Hiadoiu his dominions, where he found every thing in confu- '—vi¬ sion. Timur, who during his father’s absence had been frequently disturbed by the Seiks, a tribe of Hin¬ doos who profess deism, was in 1760 driven out by a vast army of Mahrattas commanded by Ilagonaut Row the Peishwa’s brother, of whom so much mention has already been made. Next year, however, Ahmed crossed the Indus, and easily recovered his former ter¬ ritories j soon after which he became head of a league formed among some of the Indian princes, in order to oppose the overgrown power of the Mahrattas. In this enterprise he proved successful j and overthrew the Mahrattas in a decisive and very bloody battle, in which more than 50,000 of them were killed on the spot. The pursuit lasted several days, and their vast army was totally dispersed j Ahmed being every¬ where received with acclamations as the deliverer of the faithful. In 1762 he again crossed the Indus, with a view to conquer, or rather to exterminate, the Seiks, whose incursions had become very troublesome, and even dangerous to his kingdom. Having defeated their army, and forced them to take refuge in the woods and strong holds, he set a price on the heads of all those who professed their tenets ; and that with such success, that heaps of them are said to have been piled up in all the principal towns in these parts. At last, hearing that they had assembled in great numbers to celebrate an annual festival, he marched with an army to surprise them. The Seiks, however, were well provided for his reception, and an obstinate battle ensued. During the time of the engagement an eclipse of the sun happened, which, though disregarded by the Seiks, greatly dismayed the superstitious Moham¬ medans. Ahmed was therefore defeated ; and though he frequently returned, was never able thoroughly to subdue that people. At last, having been long afflict¬ ed with an ulcer in his face, he died on the 15th of July 1773, at a place named Kohtoba, among the mountains of Candahar, to which he had retired for the sake of coolness, and was succeeded by his son Timur, who still continues to enjoy the sovereignty",Lahore,"PK,IN",6,"Pakistan,India","Asia,Asia"
"2. The Seiks inhabit a country on the other side of the Indus, and making part of Hindostan propej iy so called. They derive their origin from a Hindoo named Nanuck of the cast of Khatry. His father, named Baba Caloo, possessed a small district in the province of Lahore named Telvandi, where Nanuck was born m the year 1470. Like other founders of new sects or nations, he is said during his infancy to have given many indications of his future superiority to the rest of mankind. He seems, however, to have received no farther education than what was common to young men of his cast, viz. reading, writing, and arithmetic, and hearing the sastras or commentaries on the sacred books. In his early youth he was married to a woman of his own cast, by whom he had two sons. Being * eonvert to the worship of the Invisible, or deism, he accustomed himself to declaim against the folly of wor¬ shipping idols, and the impiety of paying adoration to any but the Supreme Being. At the age of 25 he left 1ms H I N C 489 ] H I N lostan. his family to visit Bengal, and the eastern parts of Hin- Y—> dostan ; in a second journey he visited the southern, and in a third he went as far as Persia and Arabia. On his return from this last journey, he expressed a desire of remaining in his native country ; and was furnished, according to his wish, with a piece of ground on the hanks of the river Bavy, about 80 miles north-eastward from the city of Lahore. Here he took up his resi¬ dence for the rest of his days ; and choosing to be free from the cares of this world, he dwelt at a distance from his wife and children, who came occasionally to visit him. Having acquired great reputation for his piety, wisdom, and learning, he died at the age of *70; and since his death the place of his abode has obtained the name of Dihra Daira, or “ the place of worship.” His eldest son founded a sect of devotees named Nanuck Shoiy ; but his second employed himself in the usual oc¬ cupations of mankind. On account of the oppression of the Mohammedan governors, however, he removed from Telvandi, the estate of his ancestors, and settled at Kartarpour, which his descendants still possess. They are respected by the Seiks on account of their being the posterity of Nanuck, but are not held in any veneration on a religious account","Lahore, Lahore",PK,6,Pakistan,Asia
"For many years the Seiks lived in peace, and gained the good-will of the Mohammedan governors by their quiet and inoffensive behaviour. By degrees their numbers and their power greatly increased, but in proportion to their good fortune, they seem to have lost their virtue j so that their gourous, or chiefs, who had hitherto borne the character of apostles, at last stood forth as military leaders. The first of these was named Taigh, whose successor, named Govand Sing, was the tenth and last of the gourous. He engaged in a rebellion against the government 3 but was at last obliged to submit, and even attended the emperor Bahader Shah in person. At last he was assassinated by a Petan soldier, not without a suspicion of the emperor himself being concerned. As he did not name a successor, his followers chose a chief for them¬ selves named Banda, who soon began to make depre¬ dations on his neighbours 3 but being at last taken pri¬ soner, and sent to Delhi with his family and many of his countrymen, they were all put to an ignominious death. By this execution the Seiks were so much ex¬ asperated, that they swore eternal vengeance against the Mohammedans, and have ever since manifested a most implacable hatred against them. Taking advan¬ tage of the distraction of the Mogul empire by the invasion of Nadir Shah, they conquered several pro¬ vinces. Wherever they came they threw down the mosques, and obliged every one to quit the country Vol. X. Part II. ' f who refused to embrace their tenets. The war with Ahmed Shah has been already mentioned. Since his death they have recovered all the territories they lost during their contest with him 5 and now possess the greatest part of Moultan, as well as several districts in the province of Delhi 3 including in their territories the whole of that rich country named the Panjab, on ac¬ count of five rivers which descend from the northern mountains, and inclose or intersect it, running after¬ wards into the Indus","Banda, Delhi, Delhi",IN,6,India,Asia
"The Seiks, as has already been mentioned, worship one God ; but without image, or believing in any me¬ diator. They eat all kinds of meat except beef 3 spa¬ ring the black cattle, in all probability, on account of their utility. Pork is very generally eaten, probably on account of its being forbidden by the Mohamme¬ dans. They are commonly dressed in blue, a colour reckoned unlucky by the other Hindoos. Their dress consists of blue trowsers of cotton, a sort of plaid ge7 nerally chequered with blue and thrown over the right shoulder, with a blue turban. Their government is lodged in an assembly of different chiefs, but who as individuals, are independent of one ar other, and have separate territories. They meet annually, or oftener if occasion requires, at a place called Anlberser, which is held in a kind of religious veneration ; where there is a large tank lined with granite, and surrounded with buildings, and beautifully ornamented. Their force is very considerable, amounting to no fewer than 200,000 cavalry. However, they can seldom be brought to act in concert, unless the whole-nation be threatened with some imminent danger. They are a strong hardy race of men, and capable of bearing much fatigue ; and so expert in war, that of late almost all the neigh¬ bouring countries have been laid under contribution by them, several petty chiefs having consented to pay them a small annual tribute in order to avoid their in¬ cursions. When in the field, none but the principal officers have tents, and those extremely small, so that they may be struck and transported with the greater quickness and facility. In cold weather the soldiers wrap themselves during the night in a coarse blanket, which in the time of marching is folded and carried on their horse. Their country is well cultivated, po¬ pulous, and abounding in cattle, particularly horses, which are reckoned the best in all Hindostan. This may probably be owing to the studs which were for¬ merly established in different places of the province of Lahore on account of the Mogul himself. Stallions were sent thither from Persia and Arabia, and there was a fixed order to send to the studs in Lahore all such Arabian and Persian horses as by any accident should be rendered unfit for mounting. Notwithstand¬ ing their deism, the Seiks are said to have a supersti¬ tious veneration for their sword ; insomuch, that before one of them will eat with a person of another religion, he draws his sword, and passing it over the victuals, repeats some words of prayer, after which he will freely partake of them. Contrary to the practice of all the other Hindoos, they dislike the smoking of tobacco 3 but many of them smoke and chew bang, which sometimes produces a degree of intoxi¬ cation","Lahore, Lahore",PK,6,Pakistan,Asia

With a body of English seapoys who had been put under his command, and some other troops whom he had taken into his service, he subdued the countries near Delhi, conquered almost all the territories of the Jauts, reducing the cities of Agra, Dieg, and other principal towns. These con¬ quests were indeed effected in the name of the Mogul, but he derived little benefit from them j Nadjiff being the real master, and keeping possession of them till his death, which happened in 1782: and since that time the countries we speak of have been involved in a scene of continual anarchy and bloodshed",Delhi,"UK,IN",6,"N/A,India","N/A,Asia"
"4. Next to the provinces of Delhi are the dominions of the independent rajahs, whose dominions lie conti¬ guous to one another. The principal are those of Joinagar, or Jaypour, Joadpour, orMarwar, Oudiapour or Chitore, and Jesalmire. These countries are under a kind of feudal constitution, and every village is ob¬ liged to furnish a certain number of horseman at the shortest warning. The people are brave, hardy, and very much attached to their respective chiefs j and their army is very formidable, amounting when collected to about 150,000 horsemen",Delhi,IN,6,India,Asia
"Seeva-jee having thusestablished himself, soon became formidable to his neighbours. Many of the Hindoo princes put themselves under his protection, and he atHinciostat length ventured to make war upon the emperor Aureng- w- zebe. In this he proved unsuccessful, was taken prisoner, and carried to Delhi. Having found means, however, to make his escape, he quickly recommenced hostilities j and the emperor, who was now far advanced in life, thought proper to come to an accommodation with so troublesome an enemy. On this occasion the Mahrat¬ tas pretend that their prince obtained a grant of 10 per cent, on all the revenues of the Deccan j which has often served as a pretence to invade that country, and levy contributions on the southern nabobs. Since that time the Mahrattas have become so powerful, that all the princes of Hindostan are alarmed when they put themselves in motion. Their territories extend about 1000 miles in length and 700 in breadth j and they are governed by a number of separate chiefs, all of whom acknowledge the Ram Rajah as their sovereign, and all except Moodajee Booslah acknowledge the Paishwa as his vicegerent. The capital of the sovereign was Sattarah ; but the Paishwa generally resides at Poonah, one degree to the southward, and about too miles distant from Bombay. The country extends along the coast nearly from Goa to Cambay. On the south it borders on the territories of Tippoo Saib ; on the east it has those of the Nizam and the rajah of Berar j and on the north those of the Mahratta chiefs Sin- dia and Holkar","Delhi, Goa","IN,PH",6,"India,Philippines","Asia,Asia"
"9. The Deccan, as left in 1748 by Nizam al Mulek, was by far the most important and extensive soubadary or viceroyship in the empire. It then surpassed in size the largest kingdom in Europe ; but since that time many provinces have been conquered by the Mahrattas, and the northern Circars by the British. The posses¬ sions of the Nizam are also diminished by the cession of the Carnatic to the nabob of Arcot; great part of the territories of TippooSaib; and many other pro¬ vinces of less note. Still, however, the Nizam possesses very considerable territories ; but his finances are in such a wretched condition, and his provinces so ill govern¬ ed, that he is accounted a prince of no consequence, though otherwise he might be reckoned one of the most considerable powers of Hindostan",Arcot,"IN,GB",6,"India,United Kingdom","Asia,Europe"
"10. The dominions of Tippoo Saib, the son and suc¬ cessor of Hyder Ally, are bounded on the north by the territories of the Paishwa ; on the south by Travancore, the territory of an independent Hindoo prince ; on the west by the sea ; and on the east by a great ridge of mountains, which separate them from the territories of the nabob of Arcot. The country lying to the eastward of these mountains is called the Carnatic Payen Ghat, and to the westward the Carnatic Phalla Ghat. The latter belongs to Tippoo Saib; and the two toge¬ ther make up the country formerly named the Carnatic, though the name is now restricted to the Payen Ghat",Arcot,IN,6,India,Asia

In this council all matters, whether relating to peace or war, government or commerce, were debated, the governor having no other superiority than that of giving the casting vote. In other respects the whole executive power was lodged in his hands, and all the correspondence with the native princes of India was carried on by bis means, the dispatches to them be¬ ing signed by him singly •, and all the princes and great men who visited the presidency were first received by him, and then introduced to the counsellors. He was military governor of Fort William, and commander in chief of the presidency j whence, as by his office he was invested with a considerable degree of power, he became an object of some envy and jealousy to the Hi members of the council and other considerable people in that part of the world. In consequence of this, the government was divided into two parties, one siding with the governor, and the other opposing him j in consequence of which, the debates were frequently car¬ ried on with such heat and violence, that the records of the company were frequently stufted with nothing but accounts of the contentions of these jarring parties",,"IN,GB",6,"India,United Kingdom","Asia,Europe"
"Another source of reproach to the British govern¬ ment in India was, that the court of directors in Eng¬ land became infested with the same spirit ot party and contention which pervaded all other departments ot the state. Lord Clive and Mr Sullivan were the two great leaders of these party disputes ; and as the in¬ terest of the one or the other prevailed, different per¬ sons were appointed to the administration, and differ¬ ent measures adopted. The event of all this was, that whenever a new administration was formed, the first object was to condemn the measures of those who had gone before him. Thus, in the year 1764* when Lord Clive was made governor of Bengal, the new di¬ rectors represented the affairs of the company as in the worst situation imaginable, from which they could on¬ ly be extricated by the abilities of Clive. On the ar¬ rival of the latter in the east, he took care to write home reports to the same purpose, and to condemn in the most violent manner every thing that had been done} the whole body of the company’s servants were censured indiscriminately without being allowed any means of defence, as they were in truth ignorant of the charges brought against them. When the affairs of the company were brought under a parliamentary review in the year 1774* ^ie governmen'' was brought under a new regulation. It now consisted of a gover¬ nor-general and four counsellors j three of whom were sent from England j two being military gentlemen of high rank, and the third a gentleman employed in the war-office. On their arrival they proceeded in the same manner that Lord Clive had done before them : they pronounced in the most decisive manner, that the company’s affairs were in a ruinous state j and that every species of corruption had been practised by the former government. This general accusation, unsup¬ ported by any kind of evidence, was the constant theme of the dispatches sent by them to England j and thus has the reputation of the British government suffered exceedingly through the unwarrantable liber¬ ties which its own servants have been allowed to take with one another. It must also be considered, that from the remote situation of India, and the unavoid¬ able ignorance of its affairs on that account, it was easy for any person, whose malicious purposes it might suit, to prejudice the public against the servants of the company Hi istan H I N company to as great a degree as he pleased",Clive,"IN,GB,US",6,"India,United Kingdom,United States","Asia,Europe,North America"
"It has not been uncommon, I am well assured, for the chief, that is, the first clerk of a factory, to order a peasant to plough up a rich field of poppies, and sow it with rice or some other grain. The pretence was to prevent a scarcity of provisions j but the real reason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price a large quantity of opium he had on hand. Upon other occasions the order has been reversed, and a rich field of rice or other grain has been ploughed up to make room for a plantation of poppies, when the chief saw that extraordinary profit was to be made by opium.” To this, however, the following answer has appeared in a late publication, entitled A short Review of the British government in India. “ The poppy is a plant which requires a peculiar soil, and particular care in the culture of it. The medium price of the land on which it is cultivated is about xi or 12 rupees abegah, or one-third of an English acre. It is sowed at the beginning of October, when the season of the perio¬ dical rain expires. The plant begins to be fit for in¬ cision, in order to extract its juice, of which opium is made, about the end of December, and continues so till March. It requires a dry soil, and can be brought to maturity only in the dry season, when the periodical rains have ceased. Paddy or rice lands let on a me¬ dium at three rupees a begah. Rice is sowed about the end of May, just before the periodical rains com¬ mence. One crop is raised about the end of Septem¬ ber j and another, which is the last, and by far the greatest, about the end of December. It requires a soil saturated with water, and lies soaked in it for a considerable time. On this account it is sowed just before the periodical rains commence; and nine-tenths of the quantity of rice produced in the company’s pro¬ vinces grow in the kingdom of Bengal, which is so low and flat, that the grounds are either overflowed by the rivers Ganges and Burrampooter, with their tributary streams, or soaked with the rain which falls and stag¬ nates upon them. It is therefore evident, that the soil and the season, which alone can fructify the paddy or rice, would rot and destroy the poppy j and it is there- C 493 1 H I N Hence fore as evident, that it is utterly impossible, from the Himlostan* nature of the two plants, that the one can be ploughed v——y——a up to sow the other.” With regard to the administration of the British af¬ fairs in the East Indies, it must also be remarked, that the company now act in a very different capacity from wh^t they originally did. From a society of mer¬ chants, they are now become sovereigns of the coun¬ try to which they trade. The latter character was quite foreign to them ; and they have accordingly look¬ ed upon that of merchants to be the principal one, while that of sovereigns was to be only a kind of ap¬ pendage to it. Thus, instead of acting for the interest of the country they govern, and which as sovereigns they naturally ought to do, they have acted in many cases directly opposite to it, which, as merchants, is also their natural interest. Hence also, when the ad¬ ministration in India did any thing in obedience to the orders of the directors, which orders being dictated by merchants, were prejudicial to the interests of the coun¬ try, that injury has been sometimes unjustly attributed to their servants, who acted merely in obedience to the orders they received. On the other hand, when the India administration acted with the generous spirit of sovereigns, they were sometimes blamed by the direc¬ tors, who judged as merchants, and sometimes by the ministry, who were always ready upon the smallest pre¬ tence to interfere in their affairs",March,"GB,IN,UK",6,"United Kingdom,India,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"
"From the consultations of the select committee in 1769, we are informed that the zemindars have a power of levying fines at pleasure; that they raise large sums from duties collected in the market; and that they frequently oblige the ryots or husbandmen to work for nothing. In short, the same claims made by the European barons on their vassals in the times of the feudal system, are now made by the zemindars on the common people of Hindostan. If one of them is to be married, if he has a child born, if honours are to be conferred upon him ; nay, if he is even to be fined for his own misconduct, the poor ryot must always contribute his share. Air Scrofton, in his hi¬ story of Hindostan, sets forth the situation of the in¬ habitants in the following words :—“ Unhappily for the Gentoos, themselves are made the ministers of op¬ pression over each other ; the Moor-men, haughty, lazy, and voluptuous, make them, of whom they have no jealousy, the ministers of their oppression, which further answers the end of dividing them, and prevents their uniting to fling off the yoke ; and by the strange intoxication of power, they are found still more rapa¬ cious and cruel than their foreign masters; and what is more extraordinary, the Bramins still exceed the rest in every abuse of power, and seem to think, if they bribe God by bestowing a part of their plun¬ der on cows and faquirs, their iniquities will be par¬ doned.” From this account of the situation of the people of ■Hindostan under their native rulers, it is by no means probable that they could make a worse exchange by falling under the jurisdiction either of the Mohammedans or Europeans. A notion indeed hath been industriously propagated, that the British government has behaved with the greatest cruelty in collecting the revenues and that they have even invented tortures to make the rich people discover their treasures; but on examining the matter impartially, the reverse of this is found to be true. At the time that the British government in- S terfered in the affairs of Hindostan, the provinces were Hindc found to be in a ruinous state, in consequence of thev wars which had taken place in the country. Even in the most settled state, and when the administration was most regular, the government was altogether despotic, and the mode of collecting its revenues extremely ar¬ bitrary ; the punishments inflicted very cruel ; and the whole system of government such as would be reckon¬ ed quite shocking in Europe. It is only within these few years that the British could effectually interpose in behalf of the natives; and in that short time it has produced a very considerable reformation. It is cer¬ tain, that the British government has discouraged op¬ pressive measures as much as possible ; abolished the cruel modes of punishment used by the Alohammedans; and by instituting a more regular plan of justice, has procured ease and security to the natives, and preserved them in a state of tranquillity altogether unknown to them before its commencement. Many instances of the greatest cruelty exercised upon the zemindars and other collectors are to be met with in the history of Bengal, written by a native historian, and translated by Gladwin : yet the person who exercised these cruel¬ ties w'as dignified with the titles of the faithful servant of the Empire, and the Glory of the State; which shows that the people were absolutely familiarised with cruel¬ ty, and did not know what it was to be under a lenient government. Since the British had the dominion, matters have been totally reversed, and the Hindoos, instead of being treated with cruelty, persecuted on account of their religion, and compelled to renounce it, have been used with at least comparative lenity, and great indulgence has been shown to them even in their most absurd practices and superstitions. When the Bri¬ tish government first accepted of the office of dewanny, or collector of the revenues, it was not in their power to interpose with any kind of efficacy for the relief of the inhabitants ; because it was at first thought pro¬ per to allow the taxes to be collected by natives, who would undoubtedly follow their ancient modes of col¬ lection. Even at that time, however, the mildness of the British governors had some effect upon the Asia¬ tics ; so that the people in general were treated with more lenity than formerly: and in the year 1772, when the council of Bengal openly assumed the office of dewan themselves, an immediate stop was put to all those arbitrary and oppressive methods which had been formerly in use. Formerly some zemindars had been flogged even to death, by an instrument called a korah : but from the moment that the British coun¬ cil took the collection into their own hands, not only this instrument was laid aside, but all kind of corpora! punishment; by which means the severity of tire Alohammedan government has been entirely abolish¬ ed, and no other punishments inflicted in cases of in¬ solvency than such as are in use in our own country",Asia,"GB,PH",6,"United Kingdom,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"Still, however, in such extensive dominions, where a great share of power must be one way or other com¬ mitted to the natives, it is impossible but some arbitrary acts must be committed, as the natives are always prone to acts of despotism whenever they can commit them with impunity; but examples of this kind cannot with any degree of candour be brought as a general charge against the British government in India.—Mr Scrofton gives the following account of the wretched state of H I N C 495 ] H I N istan. the provinces now under the British jurisdiction at the ——1 time they were ceded to them by the Mogul. “ When the governors of the provinces found the weakness of the Mogul, and each set up as sovereign in his own province, although they could not break through these immutable laws, they invented new taxes under new names, which doubled or trebled the value of the ori¬ ginal ones, and which the landholder was obliged to levy upon his tenants. The old stock of wealth for some time supported this; but when that failed, and the tenants were still pressed for more, they borrowed money of usurers at an exorbitant interest j and the go¬ vernment still continuing these demands, the lords of the lands were obliged to do the same : but as all this while the value ot lands did not increase, the con¬ sequence was, that at last, unable to pay the interest ot the mortgages, the rents were seized by rapacious usurers. The government finding the revenues fall shorter every year, at last sent collectors and farmers of the revenues into the provinces. Thus the lord of the land was divested of power over his country, and the tenants exposed to merciless plunderers j till the farmer and manufacturer, finding that the more they laboured the more they paid, the manufacturer would work no more, and the farmer would cultivate no more than was just sufficient for the subsistence of his family",,"GB,IN",6,"United Kingdom,India","Europe,Asia"
"Thus this once flourishing and plentiful country has, in the course of a few years, been reduced to such mi¬ sery, that many thousands are continually perishing through want. T-he crown lands are still worse off, let out to the highest bidder; and the Jagheer lands alone remain unplundered. Hence that equal distri¬ bution of wealth that makes the happiness of a people, and spreads a face of cheerfulness and plenty through all ranks, has now ceased ; and the riches of the coun¬ try are settled partly in the hands of a few usurers and greedy courtiers, and the rest is carried out of the country by the foreign troops taken into pay to maintain the governors in their usurpations. This unhappy decay the India company has already experienced in the de¬ cay of their trade, and the rise and price of their manu¬ factures ; and will, I fear, experience more and more annually.” With regard to the depositions of the nabobs by the British, which has been used as a great argument against the general spirit of British government in those parts, it must be remembered, in the first place, that these nabobs were mere usurpers, who had not the least title to their dominions, and consequently could not, in point of right, complain more reasonably of being deprived of their dominions, tliian the persons from whom they had taken them might do of their in¬ justice in driving them out. Their behaviour in government also was such, that it was impossible it could have subsisted for any length of time without the absolute ruin of the countries they possessed. Thus, in the case of Jaffier Ally Cawn, Mr Vansittart de¬ clared the country to be in so confused and im¬ poverished a state, that in all human appearance an¬ other month could not have been run through before he would have been cut off by his own seapoys for want of pay, and the city become a scene of plunder and disorder. On this account he was degraded, though without any of those circumstances of cruelty which generally characterise the revolutions in this part of the world. The administration was transferred tOHindostan",,"GB,IN",6,"United Kingdom,India","Europe,Asia"
"An account of his proceedings has already been given ; but whatever applause he might gain, and in some respects deservedly at the time, it is now said with some probability, that he raised the expectations of the people of England by far too high. The seeds of the succeeding evils were already sown. Many sources of wealth were dried up. Raw silk, cloths, and other manufactures, had formerly been exported to Guzerat, Lahore, and even Ispahan. This had ceased on the invasion of Nadir Shah ; and the influx of wealth from the European nations had ceased before the British government in Bengal had an existence. It was com¬ puted that Cossim Aly Cawn robbed the country of near five millions sterling in jewels and specie. China, Madras, and Bombay, were supplied from Bengal to the amount of more than two millions ; and several other circumstances besides these contributed to dimi¬ nish the riches and opulence of the country. In the mean time the internal administration of the country had been extremely defective. The zemindars being under very little restraint, acted in a very arbitrary manner within their own districts; and the tenants had no redress against the impositions and exactions which were laid upon them. Meer Cossim appointed annuls to the collection of the revenues rather than zemindars",Lahore,"CN,PK,GB",6,"China,Pakistan,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Europe"
"The aumils derive their authority directly from the person who has the command of the country for the present time, and consequently are more easily called to an account than the zemindars. At last, how¬ ever, these aumils, having obtained too great an in¬ fluence in the country, Lord Clive thought proper to change the plan of collection. Three natives were now appointed, in the nabob’s name, to superintend this department; and one English gentleman, through whom the business was transacted, had his residence at the nabob’s court, and communicated the intelligence to Calcutta. The principal acting minister in this plan, however, thought proper to change the mode of collection once more, and to re-appoint the aumils; , in consequence of which the revenne became greatly diminished, and they were besides complained of as greatly oppressing the people. To remedy these evils, it was first proposed by Mr Verelst, to send some of the company’s servants into the internal parts of the country with the title of supervisors: but the defects of administration were now beyond their power to re¬ medy; the revenue was not only greatly diminished, but the expence of government exceedingly augmented ; and in the year 1771 ^le company were alarmed by accounts that bills had been drawn upon them to the amount of 1,200,000!. At this time Mr Hastings was appointed to be governor of Bengal; and the con¬ fused state in which matters were at the commencement of bis administration will easily appear from the following extract of a letter from the government of Bengal, dated in the month of November 1772.—“Every zemindary was left to its own particular customs* The articles which , H IN [ 495 ] H I N Hindustan which composed the revenue, the form of keeping the ed a disposition to oppress, rather than to relieve, the Hindustan ^ »—ly!—i accounts, the computation of time, even the techni- oppressed inhabitants oi Hindostan.

The Hindoos themselves acknowledge this, and are as well pleased with the mildness of the British government, as they are displeased with the superstition and cruelty of the Mohammedans. Under the British government we cannot suppose but that commerce, to which the inhabitants of this country are so much ad¬ dicted, will be much more encouraged than by the ava¬ ricious and barbarous Mohammedans. The latter had imposed so many restraints upon trade of all kinds, by the multitude of taxes collected at the landing-places, watch-houses, markets, &c. that it was almost impos¬ sible to carry it on with any advantage. Among other salutary regulations, however, enacted by the British government in 1772, many of those taxes upon com¬ merce were abolished, and a plan laid for efFectually li¬ berating the inhabitants from those shackles by which their commerce had been so long fettered.—Regard has also been paid to the instruction of the people in useful knowledge •, and the seminary established at Cal¬ cutta by Sir William Jones, certainly does much ho¬ nour to the founder. Some regard had indeed been paid to this by the Mohammedan emperors ; but at the time that the British government commenced, these had been entirely neglected, their endowments re¬ sumed by government, and even the buildings fallen into ruin.” From-a comparison of any government to which the Hindoos have hitherto been subject, with that of Bri¬ tain, indeed, it is evident that the preference must be given greatly in favour of the latter. At the time when the British first visited that country, they were not under the jurisdiction of their native sovereigns, nor had they been so for a long time before. The Moguls were not only foreigners, but a most cruel and detest¬ able race of men ; and it was by usurpations of their own rebellious subjects that the anarchy and confusion was introduced, in which the country was involved for so long a time. The British are foreigners as well as the Moguls; but the latter, who profess the intolerant superstition of Mohammed, suffer their conduct to be influenced by it in such a manner as to treat the natives with the utmost cruelty. The greatest evil perhaps which results from the British government is, the ex¬ portation of great sums of money to a foreign country $ hut this evil, with respect to the provinces possessed by the British, existed also under theMohammedan govern¬ ment. The Mogul emperors resided at Delhi, which is far distant from the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, the territories now possessed by Britain j so that the greatest part of the treasure sent to that capital was totally lost to them. In the time of Aureng-zebe, the emperor’s ti’ibute amounted to three millions ster¬ ling ; and of this a considerable part was specie 5 but since that time the tribute was fixed at only 1,250,000!",Delhi,"GB,IN,UK",6,"United Kingdom,India,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"

"The same superstitious bigotry which incited the Ara¬ bian caliphs to destroy the monuments of western learn¬ ing, likewise impelled the Tartar khans to overthrow the religious temples of the eastern worship.

"With regard to the study of history, we must con-Of the it* sider, that all the revolutions which have happened in^I0^' the world have been owing to two causes. 1. The£t0,3r' connexions between the different states existing toge¬ ther in the world at the same time, or their different situations with regard to one another; and, 2. The different characters of the people who in all ages constituted these states, their different geniuses and dispositions, &c. by which they were either prompted to undertake such and such actions of themselves, or were easily induced to it by others. The person who would study history, therefore, ought in the first place to make himself acquainted with the state of the world in general in all different ages; what nations inhabited the different parts of it; what their extent of territory was; at what particular time they arose, and when they declined. He is then to inform himself 0! the various events which have happened to each par¬ ticular nation; and, in so doing, he will discover many of the causes of those revolutions, which before he only knew as facts. Thus, for instance, a per¬ son may know the Roman history from the time of Romulus, without knowing in the least why the city ot Rome happened to be built at that time.

"that the bare reading must be a sufficient confutation of them to every reasonable person. See the articles China and Egypt. Some historians and philosophers are inclined to discredit the Mosaic accounts, from the appearances of volcanoes, and other natural pheno¬ mena : but their objections are by no means sufficient to invalidate the authority of the sacred writings ; not to mention that every one of their own systems is liable to insuperable objections. See Geology. It is therefore reasonable for every person to accept of the Mosaic account of the creation as truth : hut an historian is under an absolute necessity of doing it, be¬ cause, without it, he is quite destitute of any standard or scale by which he might reduce the chronology of different nations to any agreement; and, in short, with¬ out receiving this account as true, it would be in a man¬ ner impossible at this day to write a general history of the world. _ 1. The transactions during the first period, viz. from History the creation to the flood, are very much unknown, no-^rom thing indeed being recorded of them but what is to be^^°ojt0 found in the first six chapters of Genesis. In general, we know, that men were not at that time in a savage state; they had made some progress in the arts, had invented music, and found out the method of working metals. They seem also to have lived in one vast com¬ munity, without any of those divisions into different na¬ tions which have since taken place, and which evident¬ ly proceeded from the confusion of languages. The most material part of their history, however, is, that having once begun to transgress the divine commands, they proceeded to greater and greater lengths of wick¬ edness, till at last the Deity thought proper to send a flood on the earth, which destroyed the whole human race except eight persons, viz. Noah and his family",,"CN,EG",6,"China,Egypt","Asia,Africa"

"For near 200 years after this period, we find no accounts of any other nation than those mentioned in the Gretki Scripture. About 1280 B. C. the Greeks began to make other nations feel the effects of that enterprising and martial spirit for which they were so remarkable, and which they had undoubtedly exercised upon one another long before. Their first enterprise was an in¬ vasion of Colchis (now Mingrelia), for the sake of the golden fleece. Whatever was the nature of this ex¬ pedition, it is probable they succeeded in it; and it is likewise probable, that it was this specimen of the riches of Asia which inclined them so much to Asiatic expeditions ever after. All this time we are totally in the dark about the state of Asia and Africa, except in so far as can be conjectured from Scripture.

"of( ' About 1048 B. C. the kingdom of Judea under jtw King David approached its utmost extent of power. In its most flourishing condition, however, it never was remarkable for the largeness of its territory. In this respect it scarce exceeded the kingdom of Scotland j though, according to the accounts given in scripture, the magnificence of Solomon was superior to that of the most potent monarchs on earth. This extraordina¬ ry wealth, was owing partly to the spoils amassed by King David in his conquests over his various enemies, and partly to the commerce with the East Indies which Solomon had established. Of this commerce he owed his share to the friendship of Hiram king of Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, whose inhabitants were now the most famed for commerce and skill in maritime af¬ fairs of any in the whole world","Of, Tyre","TR,LB",6,"Turkey,Lebanon","Asia,Asia"
"After the death of Solomon, which happened about 975 B. C. the Jewish empire began to decline ; and soon after many powerful states arose in different parts of the world. The disposition of mankind in general seems now to have taken a new turn, not easily ac¬ counted for. In former times, whatever wars might have taken place between neighbouring nations, we have no account of any extensive empire in the whole world, or that any prince undertook to reduce far di¬ stant nations to his subjection. The empire of Egypt indeed is said to have been extended immensely to the east, even before the days of Sesostris. Of this coun¬ try, however, our accounts are so imperfect, that scarce any thing can be concluded from them. But now, as it were all at once, we find almost every nation aiming at universal monarchy, and refusing to set any hounds whatever to its ambition. The first shock given to the Jewish grandeur ivas the division of the kingdom into two, through the imprudence of Reho- boam. This rendered it more easily a prey to Shishak king of Egypt ; who five years after came and pillaged Jerusalem, and all the fortified cities of the kingdom of Judah. The commerce to the East Indies was now discontinued, and consequently the sources of wealth in a great measure stopped ; and this, added to the perpetual wars between the kings of Israel and Judah, contributed to that remarkable and speedy decline which is now so easily to be observed in the Jewish affairs","Of, Jerusalem","EG,IL,TR",6,"Egypt,Israel,Turkey","Africa,Asia,Asia"
"Whether this king Shishak was the Sesostris of pro¬ fane writers or not, his expedition against Jerusalem as recorded in scripture seems very much to resemble the desultory conquests ascribed to Sesostris. His infan¬ try is said to have been innumerable, composed of 509 TORY",Jerusalem,IL,6,Israel,Asia
"Though the Jews obtained a temporary deliverance from Shishak, they were quicklv after attacked by new enemies. In 941 B. C. one Zerah an Ethiopian in¬ vaded Judaea with an army of a million of infantry and 300 chariots; but was defeated with great slaugh¬ ter by Asa king of Judah, who engaged him with i4 an army of 580,000 men. About this time also we Of the Sy- find the Syrians grown a considerable people, and118*1®"" bitter enemies both to the kings of Israel and Judah ; aiming in fact at the conquest of both nations.

"Before the death of David, however, one Rezon, who it seems bad rebelled against Hadadezer, having found means to make himself master of Damascus, erected there a new kingdom, which soon became very power¬ ful. The Syrian princes being thus in the neighbour¬ hood of the two rival states of Israel and Judah (whose capitals were Samaria and Jerusalem), found it an easy matter to weaken them both, by pretending to assist the one against the other ; but a detail of the transactions between the Jews and Syrians is only to be found in the Old Testament, to which we refer","David, Damascus, Jerusalem","IL,PA,US",6,"Israel,Panama,United States","Asia,North America,North America"
"In 740 B. C. however, the Syrian empire was totally destroyed by Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria ; as was also the kingdom of Samaria by Shalmaneser his suc¬ cessor in 721 B. C. The people were either massacred, or carried into captivity into Media, Persia, and the countries about the Caspian sea. 15 While the nations of the east were thus destroying Of the each other, the foundations of very formidable em- Western pires were laid in the west, which in process of timeIlallons' were to swallow up almost all the eastern ones. In Africa, Carthage was founded by a Tyrian colony, about 869 B. C. according to those who ascribe the highest antiquity to that city ; but, according to others, it was founded only in 769 or 770 B. C. In Europe a very considerable revolution took place about 900 B. C. The Heraclidae, whom we have formerly seen expelled from Greece by Atreus the father of Aga¬ memnon, after several unsuccessful attempts, at last conquered the whole Peloponnesus. From this time the Grecian states became more civilized, and their hi¬ story becomes less obscure. The institution, or rather the revival and continuance, of the Olympic games, in 776 B. C. also greatly facilitated the writing not only of their history, but that of other nations ; for as each Olympiad consisted of four years, the chronology of every important event became indubitably fixed by re¬ ferring it to such and such an Olympiad.

"Nebuchadnezzar, a wise and valiant prince, now sat on the throne of Babylon. By him the kingdom of Judaea was totally overthrown in 587 B. C. Three years before this he had taken and razed the city of Tyre, and overrun all the kingdom of Egypt. 'He is even said by Josephus to have conquered Spain, and reigned there nine years, after which he abandoned it to the Carthaginians; hut this seems by no means pro¬ bable. I he extent of the Babylonian empire is not certainly known : but from what is recorded of it we may conclude, that it was not at all inferior even in this respect to any that ever existed ; as the scripture tolls us it was superior in wealth to any of the succeed¬ ing ones. We know that it comprehended Phoenicia, Palestine, Syria, Babylonia, Media, and Persia, and Hot improbably India also ; and from a consideration of this vast extent of territory, and the riches with which every one of these countries abounded, we may form some idea of the wealth and power of this mo¬ narch.

"The king of Macedon, being now master of all Greece, projected the conquest of Asia. To this he was encouraged by the ill success which had attended the Persians in their expeditions against Greece, the successes of the Greeks in their invasions, and the re¬ treat of the ten thousand under Xenophon. All these events showed the weakness of the Persians, their vast inferiority to the Greeks in military skill, and how ea¬ sily their empire might be overthrown by a proper union among the states",Asia,"GR,PH",6,"Greece,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"The Asiatics have in all ages been much inferior to the European nations in valour and military skill. They were now sunk in luxury and effeminacy $ and what was worse, they seem at this period to have been seized with that infatuation and distraction of councils which scarce ever fails to be a forerunner of the destruction of any nation. The Persian ministers persuaded their sovereign to reject the prudent advice that was given Sect.

Nay, they even prevented him from engaging the enemy in the most proper manner, by dividing his forces ; and persuaded him to put Charidemus the A- thenian to death, who had promised with 100,000 men, of whom one-third were mercenaries, to drive the Greeks out of Asia. In short, Alexander met with only two checks in his Persian expedition. The one was from the city of Tyre, which for seven months re¬ sisted his utmost efforts; the other was from Memnon the Rhodian, who had undertaken to invade Macedo¬ nia. The first of these obstacles Alexander at last got over, and treated the governor and inhabitants with the utmost cruelty. The other was scarce felt; for Memnon died after reducing some of the Grecian islands, and Darius had no other general capable of conducting the undertaking. The power of the Per¬ sian empire was totally broken by the victory gained over Darius at Arbela in 331 B. C. and next year a total end was put to it by the murder of the king by Bessus one of his subjects. 55 The ambition of Alexander was not to be satisfied H*8 con- with the possession of the kingdom of Persia, or indeed^|, °ft of any other on earth. Nothing less than the total ^5 subjection of the word itself seemed sufficient to him ; and therefore he was now prompted to invade every country of which he could only learn the name, whe¬ ther it had belonged to the Persians or not. In con¬ sequence of this disposition, he invaded and reduced Hy rcania, Bactria, Sogdia, and all that vast tract of country now called Bukharia. At last, having entered India, he reduced all the nations to the river Hypha- sis, one of the branches of the Indus. But when he would have proceeded farther, and extended his con¬ quests quite to the eastern extremities of Asia, his troops positively refused to follow him farther, and he was constrained to return. In 323 B. C. this mighty conqueror died of a fever ; without having time to settle the affairs of his vast extended empire, or even to name his successor. . ^ While the Grecian empire thus suddenly sprung np^81^ in the east, the rival states of Rome and Carthage iveremans making considerable advances in the west. The Ro¬ mans were establishing their empire on the most solid foundations ; to which their particular situation natu¬ rally contributed. Being originally little better than a parcel of lawless banditti, they were despised and hated by the neighbouring states. This soon produced wars; in which, at first from accidental circumstances, and af¬ terwards from their superior valour and conduct, the Romans proved almost constantly victorious. The jea¬ lousies which prevailed among the Italian states, and their ignorance of their true interest, prevented them from combining against that aspiring nation, and crush¬ ing it in its infancy, which they might easily have done ; while in the mean time the Romans being kept in a state of continual warfare, became at last such ex¬ pert soldiers, that no other state on earth could resist them. During the time of their kings they had made a very considerable figure among the Italian nations; but after their expulsion, and the commencement ot the republic, their conquests became much more rapid and extensive.

It is proper also to observe, that af¬ ter the destruction of Tyre by Alexander the Great, almost all the commerce in the western part of the world fell to the share of th.e Carthaginians. Whether they had at this time made any settlements in Spain is not known.

The kings of Macedon, though they did not preserve the same authority over the Grecian states that Alexander, Antipater, and Cassander, had done, yet effectually prevented them from those outrages up- on one another, for which they had formerly been so remarkable. Indeed, it is somewhat difficult to deter¬ mine, whether their condition was better or worse than before they were conquered by Philip; since, though they were now prevented from destroying one another, they were most grievously oppressed by the Macedonian tyrants",Lagos,"MK,GR,AM,SY,EG,PT",6,"North Macedonia,Greece,Armenia,Syrian Arab Republic,Egypt,Portugal","Europe,Europe,Asia,Asia,Africa,Europe"

"This revolution, however, was of no long continu¬ ance. In 167 B. C. Mattathias restored the true worship in most of the cities of Judea ; and in 168 the temple was purified, and the worship there restored by Judas Maccabseus. This was followed by along series of wars between the Syrians and Jews, in which the latter were almost always victorious ; and before these wars were finished, the destruction of Carthage happen¬ ed, which puts an end to the sixth general period for¬ merly mentioned. 32 7. The beginning of the seventh period presents us Seventh pe- with a view of the ruins of the Greek empire in the declining states of Syria and Egypt j both of them of^ much circumscribed in bounds. The empire of Syria world, at first comprehended all Asia to the river Indus, and beyond it j but in 312 B. C. most of the Indian pro¬ vinces were by Seleucus ceded to one Sandrocottus, or Androcottus, a native, who in return gave him 500 elephants. Of the empire of Sandrocottus we know nothing farther than that he subdued all the countries between the Indus and the Ganges ; so that from this time we may reckon the greatest part of India inde¬ pendent on the Syro-Macedonian princes. In 250 B. C. however, the empire sustained a much greater loss by the revolt of the Parthians and Bactrians from Antiochus Theus. The former could not be subdued j and as they held in subjection to them the vast tract which now goes under the name of Persia, we must look upon their defection as an irreparable loss. Whe¬ ther any part of their country was afterwards recover¬ ed by the kings of Egypt or Syria is not very certain ; nor is it of much consequence, since we are assured that in the beginning of the seventh period, i. e. 146 B. C. the Greek empires of Syria and Egypt were reduced by the loss of India, Persia, Armenia, Pon- tus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Pergamus, &c. The ge¬ neral state of the world in 146 B. C. therefore was as follows. In Asia were the empires of India, Par- thia, and Syria, with the lesser states of Armenia, Pontus, &c. above mentioned j to which we must add that of Arabia, which during the sixth period had grown into some consequence, and had maintained its independency from the days of Ishmael the son of Abraham. In Africa were the kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia; the Carthaginian territories now sub¬ ject to the Romans ; and the kingdoms of Numidia, Mauritania, and Getulia, ready to be swallowed up by the same ambitious and insatiable power, now that Carthage was destroyed, which served as a barrier a- gainst it. To the south lay some unknown and bar¬ barous nations, secure by reason of their situation and insignificance, rather than their strength, or distance from Rome.

The battle of Actium, however, deter¬ mined the fate of Antony, Cleopatra, and Egypt it¬ self ; which last was reduced to a Roman province about 9 B.

"From this time we may date the loss of the Roman liberty ; for though Sylla resigned his dictatorship two years after, the succeeding contests between Csesar and Pompey proved equally fatal to the republic. These contests were decided by the battle of Pbarsalia, by which Caesar became in effect master of the empire in 43 B. C. Without loss of time he then crossed over into Africa totally defeated the republican army in that continent; and, by reducing the country of Mau¬ ritania to a Roman province, completed the Roman conquests in these parts.

Mahomet had not taken care to establish the apostleship in his family, or to give any particular directions about a successor. 'I he consequence of this was, that the ca¬ liphate, or succession to the apostleship, was seized by many usurpers in different parts of the empire j while the true caliphs, who resided at Bagdad, gradually lost all power, and were regarded only as a kind of high- priests. Of these divisions the Turks took advantage to establish their authority in many provinces of the Mohammedan empire; but as they embraced the same religion with the Arabs, and were filled with the same enthusiastic desire of conquest, it is ol little consequence to distinguish between them ; as indeed it signified little to the world in general whether the Turks or Saracens were the conquerors, since both were cruel, barbarous, ignorant, and superstitious",Of,"IT,IS,TR",6,"Italy,Iceland,Turkey","Europe,Europe,Asia"
"Thus was the world once more divided into three °f the great empires. The empire of the Arabs or Saracens extended from the river Ganges to Spain ; compre¬ hending almost all of Asia and Africa which has ever been known to Europeans, the kingdoms of China and Japan excepted. The eastern Roman empire was re¬ duced to Greece, Asia Minor, and the provinces ad¬ joining to Italy.

The Saxons, however, as yet possessed Britain unmolested by external enemies, though the seven kingtjoms erected by them were engaged in perpetual contests. The Venetians also enjoyed a nominal liberty, tliough it is probable that their situ¬ ation would render them very much dependent on the great powers which surrounded them.

The superstition of Omar the second caliph had prompted him to invade this country, part of the territories of the Greek empe¬ ror, who was doing him no hurt; and now when it had been so long under the subjection of the Mahometans, a similar superstition prompted the pope to send an army for the recovery of it. The crusaders accordingly poured forth in multitudes, like those with which the kings of Persia formerly invaded Greece ; and their fate w'as pretty similar. Their impetuous valour at first, indeed, carried every thing before them ; they reco¬ vered all Palestine, Phoenicia, and part of Syria, from the infidels ; but their want of conduct soon lost what their valour had obtained, and very few of that vast multitude which had left Europe ever returned to their native countries. A second, a third, and several other crusades, were preached, and were attended with a like success in both respects : vast numbers took the cross, and repaired to the Holy Land ; which they polluted with the most abominable massacres and treacheries, and from which very few of them returned. In the third crusade Richard I. of England was embarked, who seems to have been the best general that ever went into the east: but even his valour and skill were not sufficient to repair the faults of his companions; and he was obliged to return even after he had entirely de¬ feated his antagonists, and was within sight of Jeru¬ salem","Ho, Palestine","GR,SY,GH,US",6,"Greece,Syrian Arab Republic,Ghana,United States","Europe,Asia,Africa,North America"

These owed their rise to an error propaga¬ ted by some doctors of the church, who asserted that Christ had established a double rule oj sanctity and vir¬ tue for two different orders of Christians. Of these rules, one was ordinary, the other extraordinary ; the one of a lower dignity, the other more sublime: the first for persons in the active scenes of life ; the other for those who, in a sacred retreat, aspired after the glory of a celestial state. In consequence of this sys¬ tem, they divided into two parts all those moral doc¬ trines and instructions which they had received either by writing or tradition. One of these divisions they called precepts, and the other counsels. They gave the name of precepts to those laws that were universally ob¬ ligatory upon all orders of men ; and that of counsels to those which related to Christians of a more sublime rank, who proposed to themselves great and glorious ends, and breathed after an intimate communion with the Supreme Being.—Thus were produced all at once a new set of men, who made pretensions to uncommon sanctity and virtue, and declared their resolution of obeying all the precepts and counsels of Christ, in order to their enjoyment and communion with God here, and also that, after the dissolution of their mortal bo¬ dies, they might ascend to him with the greater fa¬ cility, and find nothing to retard their approach to the centre of happiness and perfection. They looked up¬ on themselves as prohibited from the use of things which it was lawful for other Christians to enjoy; such as wine, flesh, matrimony, and commerce.

In consequence, then, of the decisions of this famous council, the bishop of Constantinople began to contend obstinately for the supremacy with the Ho¬ man pontiff, and to crush the bishops of Antioch and Alexandria. About the same time, Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem, attempted to withdraw himself and his church from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Caesarea, and aspired after a place among the first prelates of the Christian world. The high degree of veneration and esteem in which the church of Jerusalem was held among all other Christian societies (on account of its rank among the apostolical churches, and its title to the appellation of mother-church, as having succeeded the first Christian assembly formed by the apostles), was extremely favourable to the ambition of Juvenal, and rendered bis project much more practicable than it would otherwise have been. Encouraged by this, and likewise by the protection of Theodosius the younger, this aspiring prelate not only assumed the dignity of patriarcli of all Palestine, a rank which rendered him independent-of all spiritual authority j but also invad¬ ed the rights of the bishop of Antioch, and usurped his jurisdiction over the provinces of Phoenicia and Arabia","Ho, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Palestine, Antioch","US,IL,GH",6,"United States,Israel,Ghana","North America,Asia,Africa"

These were persons of a most singular and extravagant turn of mind, who stood motionless on the tops of pillars expressly raised for this exercise of their patience, and remained there for several years amidst the admiration and applause of the stupid populace. The inventor of this strange discipline was one Simeon a Syrian, who began his follies by changing the agreeable employment of a shepherd for the austerities of a monkish life.

Many of the inhabitants of Syria and Pa¬ lestine, seduced by a false ambition and an utter igno¬ rance of true religion, followed the example of this fanatic, though not with the same degree of austerity",,SY,6,Syrian Arab Republic,Asia
"While the Popish superstition reigned thus violently in the west, the absurd doctrines of Mahomet over¬ spread ail the east. The rise of this impostor is rela¬ ted under the article Arabia. His successors con¬ quered in order to establish the religion of their apostle; and thus the very name of Christianity was extinguished in many places where it had formerly flourished. The conquests of the Tartars having inter¬ mingled them with the Mahometans, they greedily em¬ braced the superstitions of that religion, which thus al¬ most .entirely overspread the whole continents of Asia ami Africa ; and, by the conquest of Constantinople by tlie Turks in 1453, ""as likewise established through¬ out a considerable part of Europe",Asia,PH,6,Philippines,Asia

Sect. III. Of the Composition of History,Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"Of historic Truth is, as it were, the very life and soul of truth. history, by which it is distinguished from fable or ro¬ mance. A historian therefore ought not only to be a man of probity, but void of all passion or bias. He must have the steadiness of a philosopher, joined with the vivacity of a poet or orator. Without the former, he will be insensibly swayed by some passion to give a false colouring to the actions or characters he de¬ scribes, as favour or dislike to parties or persona affect his mind. Whereas he ought to be of no party, nor to have either friend or foe while writing j but to pre¬ serve himself in a state of the greatest indifferency to all, that be may judge of things as they really are in Composi- tioa of Historv, o R Y. Sect, in It their own nature, and not as connected with this or that person or party. And with this firm and sedate temper, a lively imagination is requisite $ without which his descriptions will be fiat and cold, nor will he be able to convey to his readers a just and adequate idea of great and generous actions. Nor is the assist¬ ance of a good judgment less necessary than any of the former qualities, to direct him what is proper to be said and what to be omitted, and to treat every thing in a manner suitable to its importance. And since these are the qualifications necessary for a historian, it may perhaps seem the less strange that we have so few good histories",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"But the generality of writers in his kind content them¬ selves with taking their accounts from hearsays, or transcribing them from others, without duly weighing the evidence on which they are founded, or giving themselves the trouble of a strict inquiry. Few will use the diligence necessary to inform themselves of the certainty of what they undertake to relate. And as the want of this greatly abates the pleasure of reading such writers, while persons read with diffidence; so nothing more recommends an historian than such in¬ dustry. Thus we are informed of Thucydides, that when he wrote his history of the Peloponnesian war, he did not satisfy himself with the best accounts he could get from his countrymen the Athenians, fearing they might be partial in their own cause; but spared no expence to inform himself how the same facts were re¬ lated by their enemies the Lacedmmonians ; that, by comparing the relations of both parties, he might better judge of the truth. And Polybius took greater pains than he, in order to write his history of the Roman af¬ fairs ; for he travelled into Africa, Spain, and Gaul, and other parts of the world, that by viewing the se¬ veral scenes of action, and informing himself from the inhabitants, he might come at a greater certainty of the facts, and represent them in a juster light. But as an historian ought not to assert what he knows to be false ; so he should likewise be cautious in relating things which are doubtful, and acquaint his readers with the evidence he goes upon in such facts, from whence they may be able to judge how far it is proper to credit them. So Herodotus tells us what things he saw himself in his travels, and what he heard from the information of the Egyptian priests and others with whom he conversed. And Curtius, in the life of Alex¬ ander, speaking of the affairs of India, ingenuously confesses, that he wrote more than he fully believed",Roman,"ES,IN,RO,EG",6,"Spain,India,Romania,Egypt","Europe,Asia,Europe,Africa"
"3. But as a particular history consists in a number of facts relating to the same state, suitably connected and laid together in a proper series; so a general history is made up of several particular histories, whose separate transactions within the same period of time, or part of it, should be so distinctly related as to cause no confu¬ sion. Such was the history of Diodorus Siculus, which contained an account of most of the eminent states and kingdoms in the world, though far the greatest part of it is now unhappily lost. Of the same nature is the hi¬ story of Herodotus, though not so extensive; to whom we are especially indebted for the Persian affairs. And to this kind may likewise be referred Justin’s history, though it be only the epitome of a larger work written by another hand. The rules proper for conducting such histories are much the same as those above men¬ tioned concerning particular histories; excepting what relates to the order, of which we shall have occasion to speak hereafter. • But the histories both of particular states and those 3 Y 2 which HISTORY",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia

"The Grecians had formerly two armies in Asia, one under Xeflophon and the other commanded by Agesi- laus. Now the Asiatics did not venture to oppose or molest either of these armies in their march. This made King Philip, Alexander’s father, who was an ambiti¬ ous prince, and aspired after universal monarchy, think it might be a practicable thing to make a conquest of Asia.

8S Of speech¬ es,Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"III. Speeches inserted by historians. These are of two sorts, oblique and direct. The former are such as the historian recites in his own person, and not in that of the speaker. Of this kind is that of Hannibal in Justin $ by which he endeavours to persuade King Antiochus to carry the seat of the war against the Ro¬ mans into Italy. It runs thus : “ Having desired jjli- bevty to speak, he said none of the present counsels and designs pleased him j nor did he approve of Greece for the seat of the war, which might be managed in Italy to greater advantage : because it was impossible to conquer the Romans but by their own arms, or to subdue Italy but by its own forces; since both the nature of those men, and of that war, was different from all others. In other wars, it was of great importance to gain an advantage of place or time, to ravage the coun¬ tries and plunder the towns; but though you gain some advantage over the Romans, or defeat them, you must still fight with them when beaten. Wherefore, should any one engage with them in Italy, it was possible for him to conquer them by their own power, strength, and arms, as he himself had done ; but should he attempt it out of Italy, the source of their power, he would be as much deceived, as if he endeavoured to alter the course of a river, not at the fountain-head, but where its streams were largest and deepest. This was his judgment in private, and what he had offered as his advice, and now repeated in the presence of his friends; that all might know in what manner a war ought to be carried on against the Romans, who were invincible abroad, but might be conquered at home. For they might sooner be driven out of their city than their em¬ pire, and from Italy than their provinces ; having been taken by the Gauls, and almost subdued by himself","Of, Hannibal","IT,GR,TR,US",6,"Italy,Greece,Turkey,United States","Europe,Europe,Asia,North America"

> 111... v— 99 Of order,Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"In a general history, the order of time cannot al¬ ways be preserved; though, where the actions of^ dif¬ ferent communities have respect to one as the princi¬ pal, they should all, as far as possible, he referred to the transactions of that state. But even here the se¬ veral affairs of those different states ought to be rela¬ ted separately, which will necessarily occasion the an¬ ticipating some things, and postponing others, so that they cannot all stand in the order of time in which they were performed. However, Velleius Paterculus says very justly with regard to this subject, “ That every entire action placed together in one view, is much better apprehended than if divided by different trifles.” In this case, therefore, for better preserving the chronology, it is usual with historians, when they have finished any particular narrative, in passing to the next, to express the time by some short and plain transition ; and sometimes to apologize for themselves, by assigning the reasons of their conduct. So Poly¬ bius, whose history is of this kind, says concerning himself: “ As in writing the actions of each year, in the order of time, I endeavour to represent the affairs of the same nation together in one summary view, it is plain that inconvenience must of course attend this 3 O R Y. Sect. II way of writing.” Curtins professes only to write the Composi actions of Alexander king of Macedon ; but his history nan of contains in it the principal affairs of the greatest states ,11 in the world during that period. Now although, in the course of those transactions, the war between Ar- chelaus governor ol Macedonia, and Agis king of Sparta, happened before the battle of Alexander at Arbela ; yet the historian not only relates that battle first, but carries on the account of Alexander s aflairs in Asia to the death of Darius without interruption; for which he gives this reason: “ If I should relate Lib. v",Asia,"MK,PH",6,"North Macedonia,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"the affairs of Alexander, which happened in the meanM,,<- time, either in Greece or Illyricum anti Thrace, each in their proper order and time, I must interrupt the affairs of Asia ; which it is much better to represent together in one continued series as they fell out, to the flight and death of Darius.” Such anachronisms, therefore, are nothing more than what necessarily arise sometimes from the nature of the subject: As every thing, the more complex it is, and contains under it a great number of parts, is more difficult to be digested in a regular order. But in a history composed of se¬ veral states, whose affairs are independent of one an¬ other, the actions of each nation must necessarily be separated, in order to represent bhem in a just view, and prevent confusion. This is the method which Herodotus has taken, as likewise Diodorus Siculus and Justin. Now both the pleasure and benefit which such histories afford, arise from observing the conduct of each state separately in the course of their affairs, and then comparing one with the other. And as the order of time must frequently be interrupted, it is not unusual to continue the chronology at proper distances in relating the affairs of each nation; which preserves an unity in the whole, and connects it in one consistent body. . , The division of histories into books was designed only for the better distinction of the subject and ease of the reader. And the dividing these hooks again into chapters, is rather a practice of latter editors (founded, as they have thought, on the same rea¬ sons), thaa countenanced by the example of ancient writers",Asia,"GR,PH",6,"Greece,Philippines","Europe,Asia"

Genesis xxxiv. 2.). Lastly, there were some beyond Jordan, at the foot of Mount Her- mon (Joshua xi. 3.). Bochart is of opinion, that Cad¬ mus, who carried a colony of Phoenicians into Greece, was an Hivite. His name, Cadmus, comes from the Hebrew Keden, “ the east,” because he was of the east¬ ern part of the land of Canaan. The name of his wife Hermione, comes from Mount Hermon, at the loot whereof the Hivites had their dwelling.

"His care in the discharge of this office gained him the esteem of that prince in a very high degree : and though lie afterwards withdrew his public favour to Mr Hobbes on account of his writings, yet he always retained a sense of the services he had done him 51 showed him various marks of his favour after he was restored to his dominions \ and, as some say, had his picture hanging in his closet. This year also was printed in Holland, by the care of M. Sorbiere, a second and more com¬ plete edition of his book De CzW; to which are pre¬ fixed two Latin letters to the editor, the one by Mr Gassendi, the other by Father Mersenne, in commen¬ dation of it: and in 1650 was published at London a small treatise of Mr Hobbes’s, entitled Human Nature ; and another He corpore politico, or “ Of the elements qf the law.” AU this time Mr Hobbes had been digesting with great care and pains his religious, political, and moral principles, into a complete system, which he called the ^ Leviathan, and which was printed in English at Lou¬ don in 1650 and 1651. After the publication of his Leviathan he returned to England, and passed the sum¬ mer commonly at his patron the earl of Devonshire’s seat in Derbyshire, and some of his winters in town, where he had for his intimate friends some of the great¬ est men of the age. In 1660, upon the Restoration, he quitted the country, and came up to London, where he obtained from the king assurance of protection, and had an annual pension of look settled upon him out of the privy purse. Yet this did not render him en¬ tirely safe : for, in 1666, his Leviathan and his trea¬ tise He Give were censured by parliament j which alarmed him very much, as did also the bringing in of a bill into the house of commons to punish atheism and profaneness. When this storm was a little blown over,, he began to think of procuring a beautiful edition of his pieces that were in Latin $ but finding this im¬ practicable in England, be caused it to be undertaken abroad, where they were published in quarto in 1668, from the press of John Bleau. In 1669, he was vi¬ sited by Cosmo de Medicis, then prince, afterwards duke of Tuscany, who gave him ample marks of his esteem and respect; and having received his picture, and a complete collection of his writings, caused them to be reposited, the former among his curiosities, the latter in his noble library at Florence. The like visits he received from foreign ambassadors and other strangers of distinction j who were curious to see a person whose singular opinions and numerous writings had made so much noise all over Europe. In 1672, he wrote his own life in Latin verse, when, as he observes, he had completed his 84th year: and, in 1674, he published in English verse four books of Homer’s Odyssey; which was so well received, that it encouraged him to under¬ take the whole Iliad and Odyssey, which he likewise performed and published in 1675. About this time he took his leave of London, and went to spend the remainder of his days in Derbyshire : where, however, he did not remain inactive, notwithstanding his ad¬ vanced age ; hut published from time to time several pieces, to be found in the collection of his works. He died in 1679, aSe^ 92, As to his character and manners, they are thus de¬ scribed by Dr White Kennet, in his Memoirs of the Cavendish family. “ The earl of Devonshire (says he) for his whole life entertained Mr Hobbes in his family, as his old tutor rather than as his friend or confidant. He let him live under his rool in ease and plenty, and in his own way, without making use of him in any public, or so much as domestic affairs. He would frequently put off the mention of his name, and say, ‘ He was a humorist, and nobody could account for him.’ There is a tradition in the family, of the manners and customs of Mr Hobbes, somewhat obser¬ vable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to his exercise, and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore, at his first rising, he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach $ or if the weather was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, to be in a sweat: recom¬ mending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had more moisture than heat, and therefore by such IJoi.hr HOB [ 549 3 HOC ] jbes, such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture ex- bby. pelted. Alter this, he took a comfortable breakfast $ ’ ’ ' and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the children, and any consider¬ able strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He kept these rounds till about 12 o’clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he ate always by himself without ceremony. Soon af¬ ter dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle with 10 or 12 pipes of tobacco laid by him ; then shut¬ ting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and wri¬ ting for several hours. He retained a friend or two at court, and especially the lord Arlington, to protect him if occasion should require. He used to say, that it was lawful to make use of ill instruments to do our¬ selves good : * If I were cast (says he) into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to be drawn out by it.’ After the Re¬ storation, he watched all opportunities to ingratiate himself with the king and his prime ministers; and look¬ ed upon his pension to be more valuable, as an earnest of favour and protection, than upon any other account","Holland, London, Of, London, Florence, London, Arlington","US,GB,UK,TR",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A,Turkey","North America,Europe,N/A,Asia"

"Having rarely been admitted into polite circles, none of his sharp corners had been rubbed off, so that he continued to the last a gross uncultivated man. The slightest contradiction transported him into rage. To some confidence in himself he was certainly entitled ; for, as a comic painter, he could have claimed no ho¬ nour that would not most readily have been allowed him ; but he was at once unprincipled and variable in his political conduct and attachments. He is also said to have beheld the rising eminence and popularity of Sir Joshua Reynolds with a degree of envy ; and, if we are not misinformed, frequently spoke with asperity both of him and his performances. Justice, however, obliges us to add, that our artist was liberal, hospi¬ table, and the most punctual of paymasters ; so that, in spite of the emoluments his works had procured to him, he left but an inconsiderable fortune to his wi¬ dow.

"In many of his prints the deficiency is so great as plainly to imply a want of all principle j which makes us ready to believe, that when we do meet with a beautiful group, it is the effect of chance.

If the sheriff officers had not been placed in a line, and had been brought a little lower in the picture, so as to have formed a pyramid with the cart, the composition had been unexceptionable $ and yet the first print of this work is such a striking instance of disagreeable composition, that it is amazing how an artist who had any idea of beautiful forms could suffer so unmasterly a performance to leave his hands. Of the distribution of light Hogarth had as little knowledge as of composi¬ tion.

The author of the Ana¬ lysis of Beauty, it might he supposed, would have given us more instances of grace than we find in the works of Hogarth j which shows strongly that theory and practice are not always united.

The grand pensionary was a person of great dignity and weight in this assembly, and his office required extraordinary abilities. There were also two councils composed of deputies, one for South and another for North Holland, who had the cognizance of the revenue and military affairs. The whole province sent one deputy from among the noblesse to the states- general, who took precedence of all others, together with three or four more.

Here they arrived on the 13th of Octo¬ ber j and having supplied themselves with a great num¬ ber of live stock, they set sail on the 12th of Novem¬ ber, but were long impeded by contrary winds from the south-east. On the 25th they were only 80 leagues distant from the Cape, when Governor Phillip left the Sirius and went aboard the Supply tender j in hopes, by leaving the convoy, to gain sufficient time for exa¬ mining the country round Botany Bay, that the most proper situation for the new colony might be chosen before the transports should arrive. They now met with favourable winds, blowing generally in very strong gales from the north-west, west, and south-west. The wind shifted only once to the east, but did not continue 4 in that direction above a few hours.

As it was the intention of thisIlat*Tes• gentleman to conciliate if possible their friendship, he used every method at this first interview to inspire them with a favourable idea of the Europeans. For this pur¬ pose he presented them with beads and other trifling ornaments, which they seemed pleased to wear, though Captain Cook found them very indifferent about any kind of finery he could furnish them with. They seemed, according to the account of that celebrated na¬ vigator, to be so attached to their own ornaments, that they made no account of any thing else. They recei¬ ved indeed such things as were given them, but made no offer to return any thing in exchange 5 nor could they be made to comprehend that any thing of the kind was wanted. Many of the presents which they had received were afterwards found thrown away in the woods. 6 Governor Phillip having parted with his new ac-Inooimni- quaintance in a friendly manner, next set about an ex-ence of Bo- amination of the country about Botany Bay, which had^any been strongly recommended by Captain Cook as theSelt*C' most eligible place for a settlement.

Of¬ fenders, therefore, he said, would certainly be punished with the utmost rigour ; though such as behaved them¬ selves in a proper manner, might always depend upon encouragement.

Of this, however, there seems to be little doubt: the general spirit of emigration which prevails through most, indeed we may say all the coun¬ tries of Europe, will undoubtedly soon supply a suffi¬ cient number j and even some of the Americans, not¬ withstanding the extent and fertility of their own country, and the liberty they enjoy in it, are said to be willing to exchange these blessings for the precari¬ ous hopes of what may be obtained in New Holland among British convicts and slaves. This rambling dis¬ position may perhaps be accounted for from an obser¬ vation which has been made, viz. that “ it may admit of a doubt whether many of the accommodations of a civilized life be not more than counterbalanced by the artificial wants to whioh they give birth.

"The settlers about Port Jackson found enough for the common purposes of life; but Captain Tench in¬ forms us, that when he left the country, towards the end of 1788, there had been no discovery of a stream large enough to turn a mill. Since that time, how¬ ever, Governor Phillip has been more successful} as we are informed by a letter of his to Lord Sydney, of date February 13. 1790 : In this letter he relates, that soon after the ships sailed in Nov. 1788, he again made an excursion to Botany Bay, where he staid five days ; but the researches he made there tended only to confirm him in the opinion he already entertained that the country round it was by no means an eligible situation for a colony. After having visited Broken Bay several times with boats, a river was found, which has since been traced, and all those branches explored, which afforded any depth of water. This river has obtained the name of Hawkcsbury, is from 300 to 800 feet wide, and seems navigable for the largest merchant ships as far up as Richmond hill, at which it becomes very shallow, and divides into two branches } on which account the governor calls Richmond hill the head of the river. As after very heavy rains, however, the water sometimes arises 30 feet above its level, it would not be safe for ships to go up so far} but 15 or 20 miles below it they would lie in fresh water, and be perfectly safe","Bay, Richmond, Richmond","ZA,PH",6,"South Africa,Philippines","Africa,Asia"
"Some ground having been cleared and cultivated, the governor in the above letter writes, that 27 acres were sown with corn, and that in December the crop was got in : That the corn was exceedingly good} about 200 bushels of wheat and 60 of barley, with a small quantity of flax, Indian corn, and oats; all which is preserved for seed : That if settlers are sent out, and the convicts divided amongst them, this settlement will very shortly maintain itself} but without which this country cannot be cultivated to any advantage. u At present (continues the governor) I have only one per¬ son, who has about 100 convicts under his direction, who is employed in cultivating the ground for the pub¬ lic benefit, and he has returned the quantity of corn above mentioned into the public store : the officers have raised sufficient to support the little stock they have: some ground I have had in cultivation will re¬ turn about 40 bushels of wheat into store ; so that the produce of the labour of the convicts employed in cul¬ tivation has been very short of what might have been expected, and which I take the liberty of pointing out to your lordship in this place } to show as fully as pos¬ sible the state of this colony, and the necessity of the convicts being employed by those who have an interest in their labour.” The, country for 20 miles to the west¬ ward is very capable of cultivation } though the labour of cutting down the trees is very great. At Sydney Cove the stores had been infested by a swarm of rats which destroyed no less than 12,000 lb. weight of flour and rice. The gardens also had suffered very consider¬ ably ; so that, having met with such a considerable loss of 3 H O L [ 569 ] H O L Hoi- of provision, and a sufficient supply not being procured I d. from the Cape, Governor Phillip thought proper to send a further detachment to Norfolk Island, where the fertility of the soil afforded great hopes of their being able in a short time to subsist themselves independent of any assistance from the stores",,"NF,IN",6,"Norfolk Island,India","Oceania,Asia"
"The New Hollanders appear extremely deficient in the useful arts. Of tiie cultivation of the ground they have no notion ; nor can they even be prevailed upon to eat bread or dressed meat. Hence they depend en¬ tirely for subsistence on the fruits and roots they can gather, with the fish they catch. Governor Phillip also mentions their frequent setting fire to the grass, in order to drive out the opossums and other animals from their retreats : and we have already taken notice of their using decoys for quails. As all these resources, however, must be at best precarious, it is no wonder that they are frequently distressed for provisions. Tims, in the summer-time, they would eat neither the shark nor sting-ray ; but in winter any thing was acceptable",Of,TR,6,Turkey,Asia
"The New Hollanders generally display great per¬ sonal bravery on the appearance of any danger. An old man, whom Governor Phillip had treated with some familiarity, took occasion to steal a spade; but being taken in the fact, the governor gave him a few slight slaps on the shoulder; on which the old man caught hold of a spear, and coming up to him, seem¬ ed for some time determined to strike, though had he done so, it would have been impossible for him to escape, being then surrounded by the officers and sol¬ diers. No encounters between parties of the natives themselves have been observed, though from some cir¬ cumstances it appears that wars are parried on among them. They have more than once been seen assembled as if bent on some expedition. An officer one day met 14 of them marching along in a regular Indian file through the woods, each man having a spear in one hand and a stone in the other. A chief appeared at their head, who was distinguished from the rest by being painted. They passed on peaceably, though greatly superior in number to our people. On another occasion they ofiered no hostilities when assembled to the number of 200 or 300, anti meeting the governor attend¬ ed only by a small party. With all their courage, however, they are much afraid of a musket, and almost equally so of a red coat, which they know to be the martial dress of the Europeans. The mischief which they have hitherto done has been exercised only on some straggling convicts, most of whom probably have been the first aggressors",,IN,6,India,Asia
"Though these savages allow their beards to grow to a considerable length, it does not appear that they look upon them to be any ornament, but rather the contrary, as appears from the following instance. Some young gentlemen belonging to the Sirius, one day met an old man in the woods with a beard of consi¬ derable length. This his new acquaintance let him know that they would rid him of, streaking their chins, and showing him the smoothness of them at the same time. At length the old fellow consented ; and one of the youngsters taking a penknife from his poc¬ ket, and making the best substitute for lather he could, performed the operation with such success, that the Indian seemed highly delighted. In a few days he paddled alongside of the Sirius again, pointing to his beard ; but could not by any means be prevailed upon to enter the ship. On this a barber was sent down to him, who again freed him from his beard, at which he expressed the utmost satisfaction. It has, however, been found impossible to form any kind of permanent intercourse with the natives, though many 4 C 2 attempts H O L r 572 ] H O L Xcw Hoi' attempts have been made for that purpose *, hut in his land. letter above quoted, Governor Phillip declares that he U""1 -v""—1 bas not the least apprehension of their doing any da¬ mage to the colony. At first the colonists imagined the spears of the New Hollanders to be very trivial weapons ; but it now appears that they are capable of inflicting very grievous and mortal wounds. T-hey are sometimes pointed with a sharp piece of the same reed of which the shafts are made, but more frequently with the sharp bone of the sting-ray. They certainly burn their dead, which perhaps has given rise to the report of their being cannibals. Governor Phillip, ob¬ serving the ground to be raised in several places, caused one of these tumuli to be opened, in which were found a jaw-bone half consumed and some ashes. From the manner in which the ashes are deposited, it appears that the body has been laid at length, raised from the ground a little space, and consumed in that posture, be¬ ing afterwards lightly covered with mould",,IN,6,India,Asia

"Hooke, Nathaniel, author of an esteemed Roman history and other performances. Of this learned gen¬ tleman the earliest particulars to be met with are fur¬ nished by himself, in the following modest but man¬ ly address to the earl of Oxford, dated Oct. 7* “ My Lord, the first time I had the honour to waittf/VM* upon your lordship since your coming to London, your lordship had the goodness to ask me, what way of life I was then engaged in ? A certain mauvmse ' honte hindered me at that time from giving a direct answer. The truth is, my lord, I cannot be said at present to be in any form of life, but rather to live extempore. The late epidemical distemper seized me, I endeavoured to be rich, imagined for a while that I was, and am in some measure happy to find myself at this instant but just worth nothing. If your lordship, or any of your numerous friends, have need of a ser¬ vant with the bare qualifications of being able to read and write, and to be honest, I shall gladly undertake any employments your lordship shall not think me unworthy of. I have been taught, my lord, that nei¬ ther a man’s natural pride, nor his self-love, is unequal judge of what is fit for him ; and I shall endeavour to remember, that it is not the short part we act, but the manner of our performance, which gains or loses us the applause of Him who is finally to decide of all human actions. My lord, I am just now employed in trans¬ lating from the French, a History of the Life of the late Archbishop of Cambray ; and I was thinking to beg the honour of your lordship’s name to protect a work which will have so much need of it. The ori¬ ginal is not yet published. ’Tis written by the author of the Discourse upon F.pic Poetry, in the new edi¬ tion of Telemaque. As there are some passages in the book of a particular nature, I dare not solicit your lordship to grant me the favour I have mentioned, till yon first have perused it. The whole is short, aud pretty fairly transcribed. If your lordship could find a spare hour to look it over, I would wait upon your lordship with it, as it may possibly be no unpleasing entertainment. I should humbly ask your lordship s pardon for so long an address in a season of so much business. But when should I be able to find » time in which your lordship’s goodness is not employed ? l am with perfect respect and duty, my lord, your lordship’s most obliged, most faithful, and most obedient humble servant, Nathaniel Hooke.” The translation here spoken of was afterwards printed in l2mo, From this period till his death, Mr Hooke enjoyed the con¬ fidence and patronage of men not less distinguished by virtue than by titles. In 17 .. he published a trans¬ lation H O O [ 595 ] H O O 3, Utlou of Ramsay’s Travels of Cyrus, in 4to ; in 1733 —' he revised a Translation of “ The History ol the Con¬ quest of Mexico by the Spaniards, by Thomas Town¬ send, Esq.” printed in 2 vols 8vo j and in the same year he published, in 410, the first volume of “ The Roman History, from the building of Rome to the ruin of the Commonwealth ; illustrated with maps and other plates.” In the dedication to this volume, Mr Hooke took the opportunity of “ publicly testifying his just esteem for a worthy friend, to whom he had been long and much obliged,” by telling Mr Pope, that the displaying of his name at the head of those sheets was “ like the hanging out a splendid sign, to catch the traveller’s eye, and entice him to make trial of the entertainment the place affords. But, (he pro¬ ceeds), when I can write under my sign, that Mr Pope has been here, and was content, who will ques¬ tion the goodness of the house ?” The volume is in¬ troduced by “ Remarks on the History of the Seven Roman Kings, occasioned by Sir Isaac Newton’s ob¬ jections to the supposed 244 years duration of the royal state of Rome.” His nervous pen was next em¬ ployed in digesting ** An Account of the conduct of the Dowager-duchess of Marlborough, from her first coming to court to the year 1710, in a Letter from herself to Lord in *1742,” 8vo.

Xenophon describes a solemn sacrifice of horses, which was made with ceremony to the sun : they were all the finest steeds, and were led with a white chariot, crowned, and consecrated to the same god. We may believe that the horses which Josiah removed out of the court of the temple, were appointed for the like sacri¬ fices. The rabbins inform us, that these horses were every morning put to the chariots dedicated to the sun, whereof there is mention made in the same book j and that the king, or some of his officers, got up and rode to meet the sun in its rising, as far as from the eastern gate of the temple to the suburbs of Jerusalem. Others are of opinion, that the horses mentioned in the book of Kings were of wood, stone, or metal, erected in the temple in honour of the sun: Others, that they were horses which none were permitted to ride or fasten to the yoke, but were free, and left to themselves, like those which Julius Caesar let loose and set at liberty af¬ ter his passage of the Rubicon",Jerusalem,IL,6,Israel,Asia

He discovered an invincible propensity to learning at a very early period, and acquired the knowledge of languages with astonishing facility. The trustees of the schools had their attention attracted towards Hottinger by his amazing progress in the knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, whom they determined to send to foreign universities at the public expence.

Being anxious, however, to en¬ joy still more advantages than this situation afforded, he went to Leyden, where he became tutor to the chil¬ dren of Professor Golius, whose knowledge of oriental languages was at that time unrivalled. By his instruc¬ tions and those of a Turk then at Leyden, Hottinger’s knowledge of the Arabic became very extensive, and Golius allowed him to copy many of the Arabic ma¬ nuscripts which he had in his possession. In 1641 he was chosen chaplain to the embassy of the states-general to Constantinople j but the magistrates of Zurich would not allow him to accept of it, resolving that his talents should be exerted for the glory and benefit of their own public schools. They permitted him to visit Eng¬ land prior to his return home, where he contracted ha¬ bits of intimacy with some of the most distinguished li¬ terary characters. As soon as he returned to Zurich, he was appointed professor of church-history, when no more than 22 years of age ; and when 23, he was cho¬ sen professor of catechetical divinity and oriental lan¬ guages.

"Not satisfied, however, with what he had already done, he concludes his “ Account of Lazarettoes” with announcing his “ intention again to quit his coun¬ try, for the purpose of revisiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, and extending his tour in the east. I am not insensible (says he) of the dangers that must attend such a journey. Trusting, however, in the protection of that kind Providence which has hi¬ therto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of unerring wisdom. Should it please God to cut off my life in the prosecution of this design, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to rashness or enthusiasm, but to a serious deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty, and to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrower circle of a retired life.” Accordingly, to the great concern of his friends, h« set out in summer 1789 on this hazardous enterprixe •, the principal object of which was to administer a me¬ dicine in high repute at home, in maligaant fever* under a strong persuasion that it would be equally effi-p*'v‘,er cacious in the plague. In this second tour in the east, “ it did please God to cut off his life :” for, ha¬ ving spent some time at Cherson, a new settlement of the empress of Russia, on the mouth of the Dnieper or Borysthenes, toward the northern extremity of the Black sea, near Oczakow, he caught, in visiting the Russian hospital of that place, or as some say a young lady who was ill of the same complaint, a malignant fever, which carried him off on the 20th of January, after an illness of about twelve days : and after ha¬ ving been kept, according to his express directions to his servant, five days, he was buried, by his own de¬ sire, in the garden of a villa in the neighbourhood, be¬ longing to a French gentleman from whom he bad received [ 650 ] *; M ]fi (in in *7 HOW [ 651 ] HOW imd received great civilities, by his faithful servant who had |j attended him on his former journeyings, and whom he we. expressly enjoined not to return home till five weeks from his death. While absent on his first tour to Tur¬ key, &c. his character for active benevolence had so much attracted the public attention, that a subscrip¬ tion was set on foot to erect a statue to his honour, and in no long space above 1500I. was subscribed for that purpose. But some of those who knew Mr Howard best, never concurred in the scheme, being well assured that he would neither countenance nor accede to it; and in ^'^•consequence of two letters from Mr Howard himself* |v0^i to the subscribers, the design was laid aside. It has, however, been resumed since his death: And surely, of all the statues or monuments ever erected by pub¬ lic gratitude to illustrious characters either in ancient or modern times, none was ever erected in honour of worth so genuine and admirable as his—who devoted his time, his strength, his fortune, and finally sacrificed his life, in the pursuits of humanity :—who (to adopt expressive words of Mr Burke f) “ visited all Eu- ^stn/ rope [and the east], not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the stateliness of temples j not to make ac¬ curate measurements of the remains of ancient gran¬ deur, nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art j not to collect medals, or to collate manuscripts : but to dive into the depth of dungeons ; to plunge into the infection of hospitals $ to survey the mansions of sorrow and of pain 5 to take the gauge and dimensions of mi¬ sery, depression, and contempt ; to remember the for¬ gotten to attend to the neglected ; to visit the forsa¬ ken ; and to compare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries.

One of them built a very tall steeple to the church here, whither the inhabitants might retire in case of inundations; to which it is very liable from the great freshes that come down the Ouse sometimes at ebb.

This intrepid mariner, in searching after a nor: h-west passage to the South seas, discovered three straits, through which he hoped to find out a new way to Asia by America. He had made two voyages before on the same adventure; the first in 1607, and the second in 1608. In his third and last, 16x0, he entered the straits that lead into this new mediterranean, the bay known by his name ; coasted a great part of it; and penetrated to eighty degree* and a half into the heart of the frozen zone. His ardour for the discovery not being abated by the diffi¬ culties he struggled with in this empire of winter, and world of frost and snow, he staid here until the ensu¬ ing spring, and prepared in the beginning of 1611 to pursue his discoveries •, but his crew, who suffered equal hardships, without the same spirit to support them, mutinied, seized upon him and seven of those who were most faithful to him, and committed them to the fury of the icy seas in an open boat.

In 1746 Captain Ellis wintered as far north as 57 degrees and a half, and Captain Christopher attempted farther discoveries in 1761. But besides these and the late voyages, which satisfy us that we must not look for a passage on this side of the latitude 67 degrees north, we are indebted to the Hudson’s Bay company for a journey by land 5 which throws much additional light on this matter, by affording what may be called demonstration, how much farther north, at least in seme parts of their voyage, ships must go, before they can pass from one side of America to the other. The northern Indians, who come down to the company’s factories to trade, had brought to the knowledge of our people a river, which, on account of much copper being found near it, had obtained the name of the Copper-mine river. The company being desirous of examining into this matter with precision, directed Mr Hearne, a young gentle¬ man in their service, and who having been brought up for the navy and served in it the war before last, was extremely well qualified for the purpose, to pro¬ ceed over land under the convoy of those Indians, for that river, which he had orders to survey if possible quite down to its exit into the sea *, to make observa¬ tions for fixing the latitudes and longitudes •, and to bring home maps and drawings both of it and the countries through which he should pass. Accordingly Mr Ilea rne set out from Prince of Wales’s fort, on Churchill river, latitude 58° 47E north, and longi¬ tude 940 yp west from Greenwich, on the 7th of December 1770. On the 13th of June be reached the Copper-mine river, and found it all the way, even to its exit into the sea, encumbered with shoals and falls, and emptying itself into it over a dry flat of the shore, the tide being then out, which seemed by the edges of the ice to rise about 12 or 14 feet. This rise, on account of the falls, will carry it but a very small way within the river’s mouth, so that the water in it had not the least brackish taste. Mr Hearne was nevertheless sure of the place it emptied itself into be¬ ing the sea, or a branch of it, by the quantity of whale¬ bone and seal skins which the Esquimaux had at their tents, and also by the number of seals which he saw upon the ice. The sea at the river’s mouth was full of islands and shoals as far as he could see by the assist¬ ance of a pocket telescope \ and the ice was not yet (July 17th) broken up, but thawed away only for about three quarters of a mile from the shore, and for a little way round the islands and shoals which lay off the river’s mouth. But he had the most extensive view of the sea when he was about eight miles up the river ; from winch station the extreme parts of it bore north-west by west and north-east. By the time Mr Hearne had finished his survey of the river, which was about one o’clock in the morning on the 18th, there came on a very thick fog and drizzling rain ; and as he had found the river and sea in every respect unlikely to be of any utility, be thought it unnecessary to wait for fair wea¬ ther to determine the latitude more exactly by observa¬ tion j but by the extraordinary care he took in observ¬ ing the courses and distances, walking from Congeca- thawhachaga, where he had two very good observa¬ tions, he thinks the latitude may be depended on with- HUD It appears fiom the map which Mr Hearne constructed of this singular journey, that the mouth ol the Copper-mine river lies in latitude 720 north, and longitude 250 west from Churchill river; that is, about 1190 west of Greenwich. Mr Hearne’s jour¬ ney back from the Copper-mine river to Churchill last¬ ed till June 30th 1772 : so that he was absent almost a year and seven months. The unparalleled hardships he suffered, and the essential service he performed, met with a suitable reward from his masters, and he xvas made, governor of Prince of Wales’s fort on Churchill river. The recent voyage of Captain Parry (1820) has shown that a sea does exist towards the parts where Hearne observed it, but whether this sea communicates directly with Hudson’s bay remains to be discovered","Hudson, Bay, Hudson","US,PH",6,"United States,Philippines","North America,Asia"

In 1767, lie returned to Edinburgh, with a much larger income, procured to him by the earl of Hertford, than he formerly had ; and now formed the same design he had formerly entertained, namely, of burying himself in his philosophical retreat. In this, however, he was again disappointed, by receiving an invitation from Ge¬ neral Conway to be under secretary ; and this invita¬ tion he was prevented from declining, both by the character of the person, and his connexions with Lord Hertford.

I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company.

"Tobacco, by its narcotic quality, seems well adapted to counteract the uneasy impressions which the gastric juice makes on the nerves of the stomach when it is empty; and the combination of testaceous powder with it may tend to correct the secretion that is suppo¬ sed to be the chief agent in digestion, and which, if not acid, is always united with acidity. Certain at least it is, that their operation is both grateful and sa¬ lutary ; for we find the luxurious inhabitants of the East Indies mix them with the betel nut, to the chew¬ ing of which they are universally and immoderately ad¬ dicted.

But in 1784, a student of physic at Edinburgh confined himself for a longer space of time to a pint of milk and half a pound of white bread daily: And he assured our au¬ thor, that he passed through the usual labours of study and exercise without feeling any decay of health or strength, and without any sensible loss of bulk.

In January xySi* he was unanimously elected to succeed the late Dr John Fothergill as president of the Medical Society. As his name and talents were known and respected in every part of Europe, so the honours conferred on him w'ere not limited to his own country. In 1780, the Royal Medical Society at Pa¬ ris elected him one of their foreign associates j and in 2782, he received a similar mark of distinction from the Royal Academy of Sciences in that city",,"GI,IN",6,"Gibraltar,India","Europe,Asia"
"He chose rather to execute it at his own expence ; and accordingly purchased a spot of ground in Great Wind¬ mill-street, where he erected a spacious house, to which lie removed from Jermyn-street in I770, I*1 this building, besides a handsome amphitheatre and other convenient apartments for his lectures and dissections, there was one magnificent room, fitted up with great elegance and propriety as a museum. Of the magni¬ tude and value of his anatomical collection some idea may be formed, when we consider the great length of years HUN [ 6?2 1 HUN years he employed in the making of anatomical prepa¬ rations and in the dissection ot morbid bodies, added to the eagerness with which he procured additions from the collections of Sandys, Hewson, .Falconer, Blackall, and others, that were at different times offer¬ ed for sale in this metropolis. His specimens of rare diseases were likewise frequently increased by presents from his medical friends and pupils j who, when any thing of this sort occurred to them, very justly thought theyS could not dispose of it more properly than by placing it in Hr Hunter’s museum. Speaking of an acquisition in this way in one of his publications, he savs, “ I look upon every thing of this kind which is given to me, as a present to the public ; and consider mvself as thereby called upon to serve the public with more diligence.” Before his removal to YVindmill-street, he had con¬ fined his collection chiefly to specimens of human and comparative anatomy and of diseases *, but now he ex¬ tended his views to fossils, and likewise to the promo¬ tion of polite literature and erudition. In a short space of time he became possessed of “ the most magnificent treasure of Greek and Latin books that has been accu¬ mulated by any person now living since the days of Mead.” A cabinet of ancient medals contributed like¬ wise much to the richness of his museum. A descrip¬ tion of part of his coins in this collection, struck by the Greek free cities, was afterwards published by the Doctor’s learned friend Mr Combe. In a classical de¬ dication of this elegant volume to the queen, Hr Hunter acknowledges his obligations to her majesty. In the preface some account is given of the progress of the collection, which has been brought together since the year 1770, with singular taste, and at the expence of upwards of 20,0001. In 1781, the museum received a valuable addition of shells, corals, and other curious subjects of natural history, which had been collected by the late worthy Dr Fothergill, who gave directions by his will, that his collection should be appraised after his death, that Dr Hunter should have the refusal of it at 500!. under the valuation. This was accordingly done, and Dr Hunter purchased it for the sum of 1200I. The fame of this museum spread throughout Europe. Few foreigners distinguished for their rank or learning visit¬ ed this metropolis without requesting to see it. Men of science of our own country always had easy access to it.—Considered in a collective point of view, it is per¬ haps without a rival",Of,"GR,TR",6,"Greece,Turkey","Europe,Asia"
"Hunting was a favourite diversion of the great and bloody conqueror Jenghiz Khan, if indeed we can apply the word diversion to a monster whose mind was set upon the destruction of his own species, and who only endeavoured to make the murder of brutes subservient to that of men, by keeping his soldiers in a kind of warfare with the beasts when they had no human ene¬ mies to contend with. His expeditions were conduct¬ ed on a plan similar to that of the Mexicans already mentioned j and were no doubt attended with still greater success, as his numerous army could enclose a much greater space than all the Indians whom the Spanish viceroy could muster. The East Indian princes still show the same inclination to the chase ; and Mr Blane, who attended the hunting excursions of Asoph Ul Dowlah visir of the Mogul empire and nabob of Gude in 1785 and 1786, gives the following account of the method practised on this occasion",,"ES,IN",6,"Spain,India","Europe,Asia"
"The time chosen for the hunting party is about the beginning of December ; and the diversion is continued till the heats, which commence about the beginning of March, oblige them to stop. During this time a cir¬ cuit of between 400 and 600 miles is generally made j Han ling, the hunters bending their course towards the skirts —v-—/ of the northern mountains, where the country is wild and uncultivated. The visir takes along with him not only his court and seraglio, but a great part of the inhabitants of his capital. His immediate attendants may amount to about 2000 ; but besides these he is also followed by 500 or 600 horse, and several battalions of regular sepoys with their field-pieces. Four or five hundred elephants are also carried along with him t of which some are used for riding, others for fighting, and some for clearing the jungles and forests of the game. About as many sumpter horses of the beauti¬ ful Persian and Arabian breeds are carried along with him. A great many wheel carriages drawn by bul¬ locks likewise attend, which are used chiefly for the convenience of the women ; sometimes also he has an English chaise or two, and sometimes a chariot; but all these as well as the horses are merely for show, the visir himself never using any other conveyance than an elephant, or sometimes when fatigued or indisposed a palanquin. The animals used in the sport are prin¬ cipally grehounds, of which there may be about 3004 he has also about 200 hawks, and a few trained leo¬ pards for hunting deer. There are a great number of marksmen, whose profession it is to shoot deer j with many fowlers, who provide game : as none of the natives of India know how to shoot game with small shot, or to hunt with slow hounds. A vast num¬ ber of matchlocks are carried along with the company, tvith many English pieces of various kinds, 40 or 50 pairs of pistols, bows and arrows, besides swords, dag¬ gers, and sabres without number. There are also nets of various kinds, some for quail, and others very large, for fishing, which are carried along with him upon ele¬ phants, attended by fishermen, so as always to be ready for throwing into any river or lake that may be met with. Every article that can contribute to luxury or pleasure is likewise carried along with the army. A great many carts are loaded with the Ganges water, and even ice is transported for cooling the drink. The fruits of the season and fresh vegetables are daily sent to him from his gardens by bearers stationed at the distance of every ten miles j by which means each ar¬ ticle is conveyed day or night at the rate of four miles an hour. Besides the animals already mentioned, there are also fighting antelopes, buffaloes, and rams in great numbers $ also several hundred pigeons, some fighting cocks, with a vast variety of parrots, nightin¬ gales, &c",March,"UK,IN,GB",6,"N/A,India,United Kingdom","N/A,Asia,Europe"

"Of the merits or defects of this theory (for an account of which, see Geology), our readers must judge for them- gelves. It has found a very able advocate in Professor Playfair of the university of Edinburgh, whose illustra¬ tions of it have received a very candid and ingenious re¬ ply from an anonymous writer, who entitles his book, A comparative view of the Jrluttonian and Neptunean sys¬ tems of geology. Hr Hutton’s theory did not meet with that reception from the public which the doctor’s admi¬ rers expected, and which it is probable he looked for himself. Professor Playfair thinks it was in a great mea¬ sure owing to the obscurity with which he wrote, so re¬ pugnant to the perspicuity of his conversation $ but as the world had received so many unsatisfactory theories before, it is not improbable that men were become dis¬ gusted with every thing of the kind, and almost deter¬ mined to refuse a hearing to every subsequent attempt","Of, Edinburgh","TR,GB",6,"Turkey,United Kingdom","Asia,Europe"
"Hyde, Dr Thomas, professor of Arabic at Oxford, and one of the most learned writers of the 17th cen¬ tury, was born in 1636 \ and studied first at Cam¬ bridge, and afterwards at Oxford. Before he was 18 years of age, he was sent from Cambridge to London to assist Mr Brian Walton in the great work of the Poly¬ glot Bible ; and about that period undertook to tran¬ scribe the Persian Pentateuch out of the Hebrew cha¬ racters, which Archbishop Usher, who well knew the difficulty of the undertaking, pronounced to be an im¬ possible task to a native Persian. After he had happi¬ ly succeeded in this, he assisted in correcting several parts of Mr Walton’s work, for which he was perfect¬ ly qualified. He was made archdeacon of Gloucester, canon of Christ-church, head keeper of the Bodleian library, and professor both of Hebrew and Arabic in the university of Oxford. He was interpreter and se¬ cretary of the Oriental languages, during the reigns of Charles II. James II. and William III. ; and was perfectly qualified to fill this post, as he could converse in the languages which he understood. There never was an Englishman in his situation of life who made so great a progress $ but his mind was so engrossed by his beloved studies, that he is said to have been but ill qualified to appear to any advantage in common con¬ versation. Of all his learned works (the very cata¬ logue of which, as observed by Anth. Wood, is a cu¬ riosity), his Religio Veterum Persarum is the most ce¬ lebrated. Dr Gregory Sharpe, the late learned and ingenious master of the Temple, has collected several of his pieces formerly printed, and republished them with some additional dissertations, and his life prefixed, in two elegant volumes quarto. This great man died on the 18th of February 1702. Among his other works are, 1. A Latin translation of Ulug Beig’s ob¬ servations on the longitude and latitude of the fixed stars $ and, 2.
