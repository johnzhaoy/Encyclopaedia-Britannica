In general this was a religious usage or rite among the ancient Greeks; and derived from yet older ages, it Clement of Alex¬ andria rightly informs us.

"Their celebrated historian Josephus, giving a detail of the rites and customs of the Essenes, who were con¬ fessedly the strictest and most pious professors of the Jewish religion, has this remarkable passage to the pre¬ sent purpose: “ The priest,” says he, “ begs a blessing before they presume to take any nourishment; and it is looked upon as a great sin to take or taste before.” Then follows the thanksgiving before meat: and “ when the meal,” proceeds he, “ is over, the priest prays again; and the company with him bless and praise God as their preserver, and the donor of their life and nourish¬ ment.” Philo, in his book De vita cantemplativa, gives an account of a body of men and women stricter than even the Essencs themselves.

"5. Man is endowed not only with sensation, but also with the faculty of reasoning; and simple inarticulate sounds are insufficient for expressing all the various modifications of thought, for communicating to others a chain of argumentation, or even for distinguishing be¬ tween the different sensations either of pain or of plea¬ sure: a man scorched with fire or unexpectedly plunged among ice, might utter the cry naturally indicative of sudden and violent pain ; the cry would be the same, or nearly the same, but the sensations of cold and heat are widely difl’erent. Articulation, by which those sim¬ ple sounds are modified, and a particular meaning fixed to each modification, is therefore absolutely necessary to such a being as man, and forms the language which distinguishes him from all other animals, and enables him to communicate with facility all that diversity of ideas with which his mind is stored, to make known his particular wants, and to distinguish with accuracy all his various sensations. Those sounds thus modified are called words j and as words have confessedly no natural relation to the ideas and perceptions of which they are significant, the use of them must either have been the result of human sagacity, or have been suggest¬ ed to the first man by the Author of nature",Man,CI,6,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

It has indeed the same significa¬ tion nearly with the numerical word one ; and in French and Italian, the same word that denotes unity is also the article of which we now treat. But the essence of the article THE being to define objects, by pointing them out as those of which something is affirmed or denied which is not affirmed or denied of the other objects of the same class, it is equally applicable to both numbers : for things may he predicated of one set of men, as well as of a single man, which cannot be predi¬ cated of other men. The use and import of each article will appear from the following example : “ Man was made for Society, and ought to extend his good-will to all men; but a man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for the men with whom he has the most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with the man whose temper and disposition suit best with his own.” We have said, that the article A cannot be applied to plurals, because it denotes unity : but to this rule there is apparently a remarkable exception in the use of the adjectives Jew and many (the latter chiefly with the word great before it), which, though joined with plural substantives, yet admit of the singular article A : two",Man,"CI,FR,IT",6,"Côte d'Ivoire,France,Italy","Africa,Europe,Europe"
"In languages of which the nouns, adjectives, verbs, have inflexion, no mistake can arise from the want ofthe indefinite article $ because it can always be known by the terminations of the noun and the verb, and by the circumstances predicated of the noun, whether a whole species or one individual be intended. But this is not the case in English. In that language, the adjectives having no variation with respect to gender or number, and the tenses of the verbs being for the most part the same in both numbers, it might be often doubtful, had we not the indefinite article, whether the specific name was intended to express the whole species or only one in¬ dividual. Thus, if we say in English, Man was born sent from God,” we must be understood to mean that the birth of every man is from God, because to the specific term the indefinite article is not prefixed. Yet the words Eyenlo uvO^uTrti; uTrirccXpivog ©sov convey no such meaning to any person acquainted with the Greek language ; as the word without any article, is restricted to an individual by its concord with the verb and the participle 5 and the sense of the passage is, A man was born {or existed') sent from God",Man,"UK,CI,GR",6,"N/A,Côte d'Ivoire,Greece","N/A,Africa,Europe"

Again, “ Man was made for society, and ought to extend his good-will to all men ; but one man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for those men with whom he has the most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with that man whose temper and disposition suit best with his own.” Now the words Hie and ille be¬ ing exactly of the same import with the words this and that ; it follows, that wherever the place of the article THE may in English be supplied by THIS or by THAT, it may in Latin be supplied by Hie or by ILLE. This is the case with respect to Nathan’s reproof of Da¬ vid, where the definite article is indeed most empha- tical.

"he apparent from the following examples. Vir qui sapit, vir sapiens, and vir sapientice; “ a man who is wise, a wise man, and a man of wisdom j” are certainly phrases of the same import. Again, homo, cui ingratus est animus, tmilus fit amicus, may he translated into Greek, uvQ^uTroi k>cx(>irlicts Koocof ; and into English, “ the man of ingratitude is a bad triend.” 47. Thus then it appears, that the relative pronoun contains in itself the force of the prepositive pronoun, together with \\\*K. connection implied in English by the preposition of, and in the ancient languages by the ge¬ nitive case. When one says vir sapit qui pauca loquitur, the relative clause qui pauca loquitur expresses that at¬ tribute of the man from which his wisdom is inferred : it is conceived by the mind, as stript of its propositional form, and standing in the place of a substantive noun governed in the genitive case by vir. The whole sen¬ tence might be thus translated, “ the man of little speaking is wise j” or, did the use of the English lan- guaiie admit of it, “ the man of he speaks little is wise.” In like manner, when it is said, “ Man who is horn of a woman is of few days and full of trouble j”—the re¬ lative clause is equivalent to an abstract noun in the ge¬ nitive case, and the whole might be expressed in the following manner, “ man of he is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.” We are sensible, that these expressions into which, in the instances adduced, we have resolved the relative clauses, will appear extremely uncouth and offensive j hut we mean not to recommend them as common modes of phraseology. Against their being employed as such, present use loudly remonstrates (l).

"The clause of a sentence, in which there is a rela¬ tive, as it is in every other respect, so is it in this, equivalent to an adjective; it either modifes, or does not viodij'y, the antecedent, according as the attribute which it expresses is or is not characteristic of the species to which the antecedent belongs. Thus, when it is said, 4< Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble,” the relative clause—who is born of a woman, expresses an attribute common to all men, and •therefore cannot modify. In like mariner when we say *»-“ SOCRATES, who taught moral philosophy, was virtuous,”—the clause, who taught moral philosophy, does not modify. In both these instances the relative clause might be omitted; and it might be said with equal truth, “ Man is of few days and full of trouble, —and “ Socrates was virtuous.” But if it be said, vir sapit quipauca loquitur, the re¬ lative clause—quipauca loquitur, modifes K.\\e antecedent vir ; for it is not affirmed of every man, that he is wise, but only oisuch men as speak little.

But in the expression, ” Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble,” the relative may be so resolved, at least without violating truth “ Man is of few days and full of trouble, and he is born of a woman.” The only difference between the sentence with the relative who, and the same sentence thus resolved,—is—that, in the former case, itcontains butane predication ; in the latter two, anti these but loosely connected","Man, Man",CI,6,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"But when the attribute expressed by the clause of the relative is characteristic of the genus or species of the antecedent, and consequently applicable to every indivi¬ dual which that genus or species comprehends, the re¬ lative clause may be entirely omitted without affecting the truth of the proposition, which is already as gene¬ ral as it can be. As in this case the import of the re¬ lative clause is not restrictive of the signification of the antecedent, it is of little consequence whether the at¬ tribute be represented by the connective part of the re¬ lative, as of the antecedent, or be affirmed to belong to the antecedent in a separate assertion. Thus it matters not much, whether we say, “ Man, who is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated that is, ac¬ cording to our analysis, “ Man of he is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated or, forming the relative clause into a separate assertion, and connecting the two by the particle and, tve say, “ Man, and he is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated.” In the one sentence, indeed, the reason is implied rvhy man should not be too much elated, viz. his being subject to death: in the other, no reason is assigned for this j we only affirm that man is subject to death, and likewise that he should not be too much elated : but as both af¬ firmations are equally true and evident, it is of little con¬ sequence in such a case as this, whether the reason upon which either is founded be implied or not","Man, Man, Man",CI,6,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"If these w’ords be relatives, and if our analysis of the relative be just, it is obvious, that no complete meaning can be contained in the clause, “ Who is your principal friend ?” for that clause contains nothing more than the circumstance o{ being your principal friend predicated of some unknown person ; “ of he is your principal friend.” That this is indeed the case, every man may be convinced, by asking himself what he means by the are merely interrogative xvho in such a sentence j for he will find l'e^atiTe ? it impossible to affix to it any meaning without supply-a!ul ing an antecedent clause, by which that which is called an interrogative will be immediately converted into the relative pronoun. The custom, however, of language, and the tone of voice with which the relative clause is uttered, intimates, without the help of the antecedent, the wish of the speaker to be informed by the person addressed of the name and designation of his principal friend •, and we know that the sentence when completed is, “ Tell me the name and designation of the person who is your principal friend.” Again, when the pro¬ phet says, “ who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bo/.rah ?” he utters but part of a sentence, which when completed will run thus : “ describe the person who cometh from Edom (this is that person), with dyed garments from Bozrah.” He sees a person coming from Edom, of whose name D 2 and 2 8 GRAMMAR",Bo,SL,6,Sierra Leone,Africa

"(m) Of the causal conjunctions mentioned in the text, recause has been already considered ; and some account must be given of the two words SINCE and AS. The former of these, according to Mr H. Tooke, is a very cor¬ rupt abbreviation, confounding together different words and different combinations of words. To us it appears to be compounded of seand, seeing ; and ES, that or it; or of SIN, seen, and ES. Seand and sin are the present and past participles of the Anglo-Saxon verb SEON, to see. In modern English SINCE is used four ways ; two as a preposition affecting words, and two as a conjunction affecting sentences. W hen used as a proposition, it has always the signification of the past participle SEEN joined to thence (i. e. seen and thenceforward'), or else the signification of the past participle seen only. When used as a conjunction, it has sometimes the signification of the present participle SEEING, or seeing that; and sometimes the signification of the past participle SEEN, or SEEN THAT. Wfe shall give examples of all these significations. 1st. As a preposition signifying seen and thence¬ forward: “ A more amiable sovereign than George HI. has not swayed the English sceptre since the conquesti‘'> That is, “ The conquest seen (or at the completion of the sight of the conquest), and thenceforward, a more ami¬ able sovereign than George III. has not swayed the English sceptre.” Since, taken in this sense, seems rather to be a corruption of siththan or sithence, than a compound of SEAND and ES. 2dly, As a preposition signi¬ fying SEEN simply : Hid George III. reign before or SINCE that example ? 3dly, As a conjunction, SINCE means seeing that: as, “ If I should labour for any other satisfaction but that of my own mind, it would be an effect of phrenzy in me, not of hope ; SINCE (or seeing that) it is not truth but opinion that can travel through the world without a passport.” 4thly, It means seen that or that seen ; as, “ Since death in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one, it were a foolish madness in the shipwreck of worldly things, when all sinks but the sorrow, to save that ;” i. e.—Heath in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one ; THAT SEEN, it were a foolish madness,” &,c","Of, George, George","UK,ZA,TR",6,"N/A,South Africa,Turkey","N/A,Africa,Asia"

"With her he received a handsome addition of fortune; and during the whole period of their union, which was but for the space of nine years, enjoyed the highest portion of domestic happiness. Of her character it is enough to say, that her husband, in that admired lit¬ tle work, A Father’s Legacy to his Daughters, the last proof of his affection for them, declares, that “ while he endeavours to point out what they should be, he draws but a very faint and imperfect picture of what their mother was.” The field of medical practice at Aberdeen being at that time in a great measure pre- N 1 occupied G R E [ ioo ] G R 'E Giegfory. occupied by his elder brother Dr James Gregory, and .— 0t[iers 0f some note in their profession, our author de¬ termined to try his fortune in London.

The late George Lord Lyt¬ telton was his friend and patron. An attachment, which was founded on a striking similarity ot manners, of tastes, and of dispositions, grew up into a firm and permanent friendship; and to that nobleman, to whom Dr Gregory was wont to communicate all his literary productions, the world is indebted for the publication of the Comparative View ot the State and J acuities ot Man, which made him first known as an author. Dr Gregory likewise enjoyed the friendship of the late Ld- wartl Montagu, Esq. and of his lady, the celebrated champion of the fame of Shakespeare, against the ca¬ vils and calumnies of Voltaire.

"The island flourished from the liberty that was enjoyed there. The inhabitants collected about I2C0 slaves, by whose labours they made themselves a revenue of near 20,oool. a-year in cotton.—The other Grenadines do not afford a prospect of the same advantages, though the plantation of sugar is begun there. It has succeed¬ ed remarkably well at Becouya, the largest and most fertile of these islands, which is no more than two leagues distant from St Vincent.” In the year 1779, the conquest of this island was accomplished by D’Estaign the French admiral, who had been prevented from attempting it before by his enterprise against St Vincent. Immediately after his conquest of St Lucia, however, being reinforced by a squadron under M. de laMotte, he set sail for Grenada with a fleet of 26 sail of the line and 1 2 frigates, ha¬ ving on board 10,000 laud forces. Here he arrived on the second of July; and landed 3000 troops, chiefly Irish, being part of the brigade composed of natives of Ireland in the service of France. These were con¬ ducted by Count Dillon, who disposed them in such a manner as to surround the bill that overlooks and commands George’s town, together with the fort and harbour. To oppose these, Lord M‘Cartney, the governor, had only about 150 regulars, and 300 or 400 armed inhabitants ; but though all resistance was evidently vain, he determined nevertheless to make an honourable and gallant defence. The preparations be made were such as induced D’Estaign himself to be present at the attack ; and, even with his vast superiori¬ ty of force, the first attack on the entrenchments proved unsuccessful",George,"IE,FR,GD,ZA",6,"Ireland,France,Grenada,South Africa","Europe,Europe,North America,Africa"

"Having thus attained the age of 74, through a life of continued prosperity, universally admired as a gentle¬ man and a scholar, he fell by the hand of an assassin, one of his own domestics, who immediately stabbed himself with the same weapon with which he had mur¬ dered his master. This fellow’s name was Haywood j and the cause is said to have been a severe reprimand for his presumption in upbraiding his master for not providing for him after his death. It seems he had been witness to Lord Brook’s will, and knew the con¬ tents. Some say he stabbed him with a knife in the back, others with a sword. This affair happened at Brook-house in Holborne.—Lord Brook was buried with great pomp in St Mary’s church at Warwick, in his own vault, over which he had erected a monu¬ ment of black and white marble, ordering at his death the following inscription to be engraved upon the tomb : “ Fulke Greville, servant to Queen Elizabeth, counsellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sid¬ ney.

"Grimaldi was amiable in his manners, as well as skilful in his profession : he was generous without profusion, respectful to the great without meanness, and chari¬ table to the poor. The following instance of his bene¬ volence may serve to characterize the man. A Sicilian gentleman, who had retired from Messina with his daughter during the troubles of that country, was re¬ duced to the misery of wanting bread. As he lived over-against him, Grimaldi was soon informed of it •, and in the dusk of the evening, knocking at the Sici¬ lian’s door, without making himself known, tossed in money and retired. The thing happening more than once, raised the Sicilian’s curiosity to know his bene¬ factor *, who finding him out, by hiding himself behind the door, fell down on his knees to thank the hand that had relieved him. Grimaldi remained confused, offered him his house, and continued his friend till his death. He died of a dropsy at Rome in 1680, and left a considerable fortune among six children. The genius of Grimaldi directed him chiefly to landscape, which he executed most happily. His colouring is strongs his touch light and delicate j his situations are uncom¬ monly pleasing; and the leafing of his trees is admi¬ rable. Sometimes, indeed, his colouring G E I ig appears ra- IC8 ] ther too green : but those landscapes, which he painted Grimaif in the manner of Caracci, may serve as models for all |) those who admire the style of that school ; and he de- signed his figures in an elegant taste.

"GRISONS, a people situated among the Alps, and allies of the Swiss. Their country is bounded on the north G R I [ Grifon*. north by the countries of Surgans and Bludenz v—' canton of Claris, and the principality of Lichtenstein 5 on the south by the canton’s Italian bailhvics, the county of Chavenne, and the Valteline : on the east by the territories of Venice and Milan ; and on the west by some of the Italian bailiwics, and the canton of Uri. It is divided into three leagues, viz. the Grison or grey league, the league of the house oj God, and that of the ten jurisdictions ; which unite and term one republic. The two first lie towards the south, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above 70 miles, and the breath about 60. The in¬ habitants are said to have had the name of Orisons from the grey coats they wore in former times. This coun¬ try, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous ; but the mountains yield good pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats, with some rye and barley : in the valleys there is plenty of grain, pulse, fruits, and wine. This coun¬ try also abounds with hogs and wild-fowl } but there is a scarcity of fish and salt, and their horses are mostly purchased of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are also several lakes, most of which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Grisons is either a corrupt Italian or the German. Each of the leagues is subdivided into several lesser communities, which are so many demo¬ cracies ; every male above 16 having a share in the go¬ vernment of the community, and a vote in the election of magistrates. Deputies from the several communi¬ ties constitute the general diet of the Grison leagues, which meets annually, and alternately at the capital of each league ; but they can conclude nothing without the consent of their constituents. This country was anciently a part of Rhetia. After the extinction of the Roman empire in the west, it w,as some time sub¬ ject to its own dukes, or those of Swabia. Then the bishop of Coire, and other petty princes, dependent on the emperors of Germany, became masters of great part of it: at last, by the extinction of some, pur¬ chase, voluntary grants, and force, it got rid of all its lords, and erected itself into three distinct republics, each of which, as we observed already, is subdivided into a certain number of communities, which are a sort of republics, exercising every branch of sovereignty, except that of making peace or war, sending embassies, concluding alliances, and enacting laws relating to the whole country, which belong to the provincial diets of the several leagues. The communities may be compa¬ red to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the seve¬ ral leagues to the provincial states. The particular diets are composed of a deputy from each community ; and both in them and the communities every thing is deter¬ mined by a majority of votes. In the communities, every male above 16 has a vote. Besides the annual provincial diets for choosing the chiefs and other offi¬ cers, and deliberating on the affairs of the respective leagues, there are general diets for what concerns all the three leagues or whole body. In both these, the representatives can do nothing of themselves, but are tied down to the instructions of their principals","Venice, Roman, Holland","IT,DE,US,RO,SZ",6,"Italy,Germany,United States,Romania,Eswatini","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe,Africa"
"The richest benefices do not perhaps yield more than 20I. or at most 25I. per annum, and the poorest some¬ times scarcely 61. This scanty income is attended with many inconveniences. It obliges the clergy who have families to follow some branch of traffic, to the neglect of their ecclesiastical studies, and to the degradation of the professional character. Another inconvenience is superadded to the narrowness of their income. In most communities the ministers, though confirmed by the synod, are chosen by the people of the parish, and are solely dependent on their bounty. In 1798, the Grisons, who had formerly been only the al¬ lies of the Swiss, were incorporated with the confe¬ deracy as a canton, which still remained however di¬ vided into the three leagues as before. The whole po¬ pulation of the Grisons has been recently estimated at 73,000, of whom 26,000 speak German, 10,000 Ita¬ lian, and 37,000 the Romansh, or ancient Rhcetian lan¬ guage.

Young Grose obtained an independent fortune by the death of his father, which happened in the year 1769. He was paymaster and ad¬ jutant in the Surry militia, but dissipation so far pre¬ vented him for some time from paying proper attention to his duty, that in his own humorous mode of express¬ ing himself, he kept but two books of accounts, his right and left hand pockets.

"A dreadful famine was the consequence of this kind of war. The colonists were reduced to graze in the Helds, to eat their own excrements, and to dig up dead bodies for their subsistence. Many who had been slaves at Algiers, held in abhorrence the hands that had broken their fetters : and all of them cursed their exist¬ ence. It was in this manner that they atoned for the crime of their invasion, till the government of Aubert brought a peace with the savages at the end of the year 1640. The remembrance, however, of hardships en¬ dured in an invaded island, proved a powerful incite¬ ment to the cultivation of all articles of immediate ne¬ cessity j which afterwards induced an attention to those of luxury consumed in the mother-country. The few inhabitants who had escaped the calamities they had drawn upon themselves, were soon joined by some dis¬ contented colonists from St Christopher’s, by Europeans fond of novelty, by sailors tired of navigation, and by some sea-captains, who prudently chose to commit to the care of a grateful soil the treasures they had saved from the dangers of the sea.

After setting forth the services which the Scots had performed for Charles VII. in expelling the English out of France, and reducing the kingdom to his obedience, he adds—“Since which Mit. of reduction, and for the service of the Scots upon that occasion, and for the great loyalty and virtue which he Seysil^ma- found in them, he selected 200 of them for the guard ster of re- of his person, of whom he made an hundred men at quests to arms, and an hundred life-guards : And the hundred tllat Jjrince“ men at arms are the hundred lances of our ancient or¬ dinances ; and the life-guard men are those of our guard who still are near and about our person.”—As to their fidelity in this honourable station, the histo¬ rian, speaking of Scotland, says, “ The French have so ancient a friendship and alliance with the Scots, that of 400 men appointed for the king’s life-guard, there are an hundred of the said nation who are the nearest to his person, and in the night keep the keys of the apartment where he sleeps. There are, moreover, an hundred complete lances and two hundred yeomen of the said nation, besides several that are dispersed through the companies : And for so long a time as they have served in France, never hath there been one of them found that hath committed or done any fault against the kings or their estate ; and they make use of them as of their own subjects.” The ancient rights and privileges of the Scottish life-guards were very honourable; especially of the twenty-four first. The author of the Ancient Alliance says, “ On high holidays, at the ceremony of the royal touch, the erection of knights of the king’s order, the reception of extraordinary ambassadors, and the public entries of cities, there must be six of their number- next to the king’s person, three on each side; and the body of the king must be carried by these only, where¬ soever ceremony requires. They have the keeping of the keys of the king’s lodging at night, the keeping of the choir of the chapel, the keeping the boats where the king passes the rivers; and they have the honour of bearing the white silk fringe in their arms, which in Fiance is the coronne coleur. The keys of all the cities where the king makes his entry are given to their captain in waiting or out of waiting.—He has the privilege, in waiting or out of waiting, at ceremonies, such as coronations, marriages, and funerals of the kings, and at the baptism and marriage of their chil¬ dren, to take duty upon him. The coronation robe belongs to him ; and this company, by the death or change of a captain, never changes its rank, as do the three others.” This company’s first commander, who is recorded as a person of great valour and military accomplish¬ ments, was Robert Patillock, a native of Dundee ; andu [ 125 ] G U A [ 126 ] G U A Cuanl, an« tiie 1)an(5» ever ar(3ent t0 distinguish itself, conti- Guardian. nued in great reputation till the year 1578.

From that river to the river Gambia, and in the southerly course to Cape Sierra Leona, is comprehended a coast of about 700 miles ; being the same tract for which Queen Elizabeth grant¬ ed charters to the first traders to that coast.

"Here are vast meadows, which feed large herds of P* 4(5- great and small cattle, and poultry numerous : the villages that lie thick on the river, show the country R 3 is 9 u i [ i; GUj„ea is well peopled.” The same author, in the account of v~~— a voyage he made up the river Gambia, the mouth of which lies about 300 miles south of the Senegal, and is navigable about 600 miles up the country, says, “ that he was surprised to see the laud so well culti¬ vated *, scarce a spot lay unimproved ; the low lands divided by small canals were all sowed with rice, &c",,"GM,SN",6,"Gambia,Senegal","Africa,Africa"
"th.e higher ground planted with millet, Indian corn, and pease of different sorts j their beef excellent j poultry plenty and very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.” Mr Moore, who was sent from England about the year 1735, in the service of the African company, and resided at Janies Fort on the river Gambia, or in other factories on that river, about five years, confirms the above account of the fruitful¬ ness of the country. Captain Smith, who was sent in the year 1726 by the African company to survey their settlements throughout the whole coast of Guinea, * Voyage says *> “ th0 country about the Gambia is pleasant and to Guinea, fruitful j provisions of all kinds being plenty and ex- p. 31, 34. ceeding cheap.” The country on and between the two above-mentioned rivers is large and extensive, in¬ habited principally by those three Negro nations known by the name of Jalqfs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalofs possess the middle of the country. The Fulis principal settlement is on both sides of the Senegal : great numbers of these people are also mixed with the Mandingos j which last are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia. The government of the Jalofs is represented as under a better regulation than can be expected from the common opinion we entertain of the negroes. We are told in Astley’s Collection, “That the king has under him several ministers of state, who assist him in the exercise of justice. The grand jerafo is the chief justice through all the king’s dominions, and goes in circuit from time to time to hear complaints and determine controversies. The king’s treasurer exercises the same employment, and has under him alkairs, who are governors of towns or villages. That the kondi, or viceroy, goes the cir¬ cuit with the chief justice, both to hear causes and in¬ spect into the behaviour of the alkadi, or chief ma¬ gistrate of every village in their several districts.” Vas- concelas, an author mentioned in the Collection, says, “ the ancientest are preferred to be the prince’s coun¬ sellors, who keep always about his person ; and the men of most judgment and experience are the judges.” The Fulis are settled on both sides of the river Senegal: their country, which is very fruitful and populous, extends near 400 miles from east to west. They are generally of a deep tawney complexion, appearing to bear some affinity to the Moors, whose country they join on the north : they are good farmers, and make great harvest of corn, cotton, tobacco, &c. and breed great numbers of cattle of all kinds. But the most particu¬ lar account we have of these people is from Moore, + Travels who saysf, “ Some of these Full blacks, who dwell on into distant both sides the river Gambia, are in subjection to the parts of Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell, having been Africa, prohably driven out of their country by war or famine",Moore,"GM,GN,SN,US,IN",6,"Gambia,Guinea,Senegal,United States,India","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"
"P- 19 * They have chiefs of their own, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink brandy, or any thing stronger than water and sugar, being strict Maho¬ metans. Their form of government goes on easy, be¬ cause the people are of a good quiet disposition, and so 52 ] GUI well instructed in what is right, that a man who does Gwnti 6"" ill is the abomination of all, and none will support him'—-~ against the chief. In these countries the natives are not covetous of land, desiring no more than what they use y and as they do not plough with horses and cattle, they can use but very little ; therefore the kings are willing to give the I ulis leave to live 111 their country, and cultivate their lands. If any of their people are known to be made slaves, all the Fulis will join to re¬ deem them j they also support the old, the blind, the lame, amongst themselves j and as far as their abilities go, they supply the necessities of the Mandingos, great numbers of whom they have maintained in famine.” The author, from his own observations, sajs, “ Ihey were rarely angry, and that he never heard them abuse one another.” The Mandingos are said by Mr Brue before men¬ tioned, “ to be the most numerous nation on the Gambia, besides which, numbers of them are dispersed over all these countries j being the most rigid Maho- ^ metans amongst the negroes, they drink neither wine ^ nor brandy, and are politer than the other negroes",,GM,6,Gambia,Africa
"Many are industrious and laborious, keeping their grounds well cultivated, and breeding a good stock of cattle f. Every town has an alkadi, or governor,!!* who has great power j for most of them having twoc* common fields of clear ground, one for corn, and thep,li other for rice, the alkadi appoints the labour of all the people. The men work the corn ground, and the women and girls the rice ground ; and as they all equally labour, so he equally divides the corn amongst them 5 and in case any are in want, the others supply them. This alkadi decides all quarrels, and has the first voice in all conferences in town affairs.” Some of these Mandingos, who are settled at Galem, far up the river Senegal, can read and write Arabic tolerably j and are a good hospitable people, who carry on a trade with the inland nations. “ They are extremely populous in those parts, their women being fruitful, and they not suffering any person amongst them, but such as are guilty of crimes, to be made slaves.” We are told from Jobson, “ That the Mahometan negroes say their prayers thrice a-day. Each village has a priest who calls them to their duty. It is surprising (says the author), as well as commendable, to see the modesty, attention, and reverence they observe during their worship.” He asked some of their priests the purport of their prayers and ceremonies j their answer always was, “ that they adored God by prostrating themselves before him ; that by humbling themselves they acknowledged their own insignificancy, and farther intreated him to forgive their faults, and to grant them all good and necessary things, as well as deliverance from evil.” Jobson takes notice of se¬ veral good qualities in these negro priests, particular¬ ly their great sobriety. They gain their livelihood by keeping school for the education of the children. The boys are taught to read and write. They not only teach school, but rove about the country, teaching and instructing, for which the whole country is open to them ; and they have a free course through ad places, though the kings may be at war with one another",,SN,6,Senegal,Africa
"It was in these parts of Guinea that M. Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, was employed from the year 1749 to the year 1753, wholly in making natural and philosophical ob¬ servations on the country about the rivers Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great heats in Senegal, he essays*, “ it is to them that they are partly indebted for the fertility of their lands •, which is so great, that, with oS‘little labour and care, there is no fruit nor grain but grows in great plenty.” Of the soil on the Gambia, he says, “ it is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile ; it produces spontaneous¬ ly, and almost without cultivation, all the necessaries of life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots. Every thing matures to perfection, and is excellent in its kind.” One thing which always surprised him, was the pro¬ digious rapidity with which the sap of trees repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in that country j “ Arid I was never (says he) more astonished, than when landing four days after the locusts had devoured all the fruits and leaves, and even the buds of the trees, to find the trees covered, with new leaves, and they did not seem to me to have suffered much.”—“ It was then (says the same author) the fish season ; you might see them in shoals approaching towards land","Paris, Of","SN,GM,GN,US,TR",6,"Senegal,Gambia,Guinea,United States,Turkey","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"

"amazing that such a rude and illiterate people should reason so pertinently in regard to those heavenly bodies^ there is no manner of doubt, but that with proper in¬ struments, and a good will, they would become excel¬ lent astronomers.” 2. That part of Guinea known by the name of the Grain and Ivory Coast extends about 500 miles. The soil is said to be in general fertile, producing abun¬ dance of rice and roots ; indigo and cotton thrive with¬ out cultivation, and tobacco would be excellent if carefully manufactured; they have fish in plenty; their flocks greatly increase ; and their trees are load¬ ed with fruit. They make a cotton cloth, which sells well on the coast. In a word, the country is rich, and the commerce advantageous, and might he greatly aug¬ mented by such as would cultivate the friendship of the natives. These are represented by some writers as a rude, treacherous people ; whilst several other authors of credit give them a very different character, de¬ scribing them as sensible, courteous, and the fairest traders on the coast of Guinea. In the Collection, they are said f to be averse to drinking to excess, and>t '*• such as do are severely punished by the king’s order. ^ ^ ' On inquiry why there is such a .disagreement in the character given of these people, it appears, that though they are naturally inclined to he kind to strangers, with whom they are fond of trading, yet the frequent injuries done them by Europeans have occasioned their being suspicious and shy : the same cause has been the occasion of the ill treatment they have sometimes given to innocent strangers, who have attempted to trade with them. As the Europeans have no settle¬ ment on this part of Guinea, the trade is carried on by signals from the ships, on the appearance of which the natives usually come on hoard in their canoes, bring¬ ing their gold-dust, ivory, &c. which has given oppor¬ tunity to some villanous Europeans to carry them oft’ with their effects, or retain them on board till a ran¬ som is paid.

"when on the coast, wrote, “ ^ e cast anchor, hut not one negro coming on board, I went on shore j and aite* having staid a while on the strand, some negroes came to me 5 and being desirous to be informed why they did not come on board, I was answered, that about two months before, the English had been there with two large vessels, and had ravaged the country, de¬ stroyed all their canoes, plundered their houses, and car¬ ried off some of their people, upon which the remain¬ der fled to the inland country, where most of them were at that time •, so that there being not much to be done by us, we were obliged to return on hoard. When I inquired after their wars with other countries, they told me they wqre not often troubled with them 5 hut if any difference happened, they chose rather to end the dispute amicably than to come to arms He found the inhabitants civil and good-natured. Speak¬ ing of the king of Eio Sestro, lower down the coast, he says, “ He was a very agreeable, obliging man ; and all his subjects are civil, as well as very labori¬ ous in agriculture and the pursuits of trade.Mar- chais f says, “ That though the country is very popu¬ lous, yet none of the natives (except criminals) are sold for slaves.” Vaillant never heard of any settle¬ ment being made by the Europeans on this part of Guinea 5 and Smith remarks J, “ That these coasts which are divided into several little kingdoms, and have seldom any wars, is the reason the slave-trade is not so good here as on the Gold and Slave Coast, where the Europeans have several forts and factories.” A plain evidence this, that it is the intercourse with the Europeans, and their settlements on the coast, which gives life to the slave-trade",,"GN,UK",6,"Guinea,N/A","Africa,N/A"
"3. Next adjoining to the Ivory Coast are those called the Gold Coast and i\\e Slave Coast; authors are not agreed about their bounds, hut their extent together along the coast may be about 500 miles. And as the policy, produce, and economy of these two kingdoms ot Guinea are much the same, they shall be described together",Gold Coast,"CI,GN,AU",6,"Côte d'Ivoire,Guinea,Australia","Africa,Africa,Oceania"
"This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable •, pro¬ ducing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bosnian, princi¬ pal factor for the Dutch at D’Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold Coast, says, “ The negro inha¬ bitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold : That they are industri¬ ously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture 5 but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here Guinea, in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence all over the Gold Coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, re¬ turning full fraught with millet, jamms, potatoes, and palm oik” The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, “ This country, as well as the Gold Coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees 5 its valleys, betwixt the lulls, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.” He adds, “ In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts 5 but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.” The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, “ was formerly so powerful and po¬ pulous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations ; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined j there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may he compared to the country of Ante just before described j frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and po¬ pulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agri¬ culture 5 some soav corn •, others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.” Smith gives much the same account of the before- mentioned parts of the Gold Coast ; and adds, “ the country about D’Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous 5 and the nearer we come towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow with¬ in the torrid zone.” Barbot also remarks*, rvith re-* spect to the countries of Ante and Adorn, “ That theDficflft soil is very good and fruitful in corn and other pro-°J duce ; which it affords in such plenty, that besides whatP'1^' serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale : they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and Avild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish ; so that nothing is Avanting for the sup¬ port of life and to make it easy.” In the Collection it is said, “ That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and sup¬ ply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine ; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as Avell by Euro¬ peans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.” These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable j not apt to shed human blood, except Avhen much provoked ; and ready to assist one ano¬ ther. In the Collection it is said, “ That the fish¬ ing business is esteemed on the Gold Coast next to tra¬ ding $ that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Kor- mantin 5 from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes, CG G U I [ a. canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread them- selves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish j a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.” Smith says, “ The country about Acra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very de¬ lightful, and the natives courteous and civil to stran¬ gers.” He adds, “ That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not un¬ common to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves. The Malay people are generally natives of Malacca, in the East Indies, situated several thousand miles from the Gold Coast.” They differ very much from the Guinea negroes, being of a tawney complexion with long black hair","Elmina, Axim, Gold Coast, Gold Coast, Gold Coast, Elmina, Cape Coast, Gold Coast, Malacca, Gold Coast","AU,GH,GN,NL,MY,BA,IN,UK",6,"Australia,Ghana,Guinea,Netherlands,Malaysia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,India,N/A","Oceania,Africa,Africa,Europe,Asia,Europe,Asia,N/A"
"Afterwards, they in like manner sow the ground al- otted for their neighbours as diligently as that of the ,ing s» b7 vvb<M11 they are also feasted ; and so con¬ tinue to work in a body for the public benefit till 35 ] GUI every man’s ground is tilled and sov/cd. None but Guinea, the king, and a few great men, are exempted from y~~ this labour. Their grain soon sprouts out of the ground. When it is about a man’s height, and be¬ gins to ear, they raise a wooden house in the centre of the field, covered with straw, in which they set their childx-en to watch their corn, and iright away the birds.” Bosman speaks in commendation of the civility, kindness, and great industry of the natives of Whi¬ dah. This is confirmed by Smith, who says, “ The natives here seem to be the most gentleman-like ne¬ groes in Guinea, abounding with good manners and ceremony to each other. The inferior pay the utmost deference and respect to the superior, as do wives to their husbands, and children to their parents. All here are naturally industrious, and find constant em¬ ployment ; the men in agriculture, and the women in spinning and weaving cotton. The men, whose chief talent lies in husbandry, are unacquainted with arms; otherwise, being a numerous people, they could have made a better defence against the king of Dahomy, who subdued them without much trouble.” Accord¬ ing to tbe Collection, there are, throughout the Gold Coast, regular markets in all villages, furnished with provisions and merchandise, held every day in the week except Tuesday, whence they supply, not only the in¬ habitants, but. the European ships. The negro wo¬ men are very expert in buying and selling, and ex¬ tremely industrious; for they will repair daily to mar¬ ket from a considerable distance, loaded like pack- horseS, with a child perhaps at their hack, and a heavy burden on their heads. After selling their wares, they buy fish and other necessaries, and return home loaded as they came. There is a market held at Sabi every fourth day, also a weekly one in the province of Apologua, which is so resorted to, that there are usually 5000 or 6000 merchants. Their markets are so well regulated and governed, that seldom any disorder happens ; each species of merchandise and merchants have a separate place allotted them by themselves",,GN,6,Guinea,Africa
"Bosman tells us, “ the Whidah negroes have a faint idea of a true God, ascribing to him the attributes of almighty power and omnipresence : but God, they say, is too high to condescend to think of mankind } wherefore he commits the government of the world to those inferior deities which they worship.” Some au¬ thors say, the wisest of these negroes are sensible of their mistake in this opinion ; but dare not forsake their own religion, for fear of the populace rising and killing them. This is confirmed by Smith, who says, “ that all the natives of this coast believe there is one true God, the author of them and all things j that they have some apprehension of a future state 5 and that al¬ most every village has a grove, or public place of wor¬ ship, to which the principal inhabitants, on a set day, resort to make their offerings.” In the Collection it is remarked as an excellency in the Guinea government, “ that however poor they may be in general, yet there are no beggars to be found amongst them $ which is owing to the care of their chief men, whose province it is to take care of the wel¬ fare of the city or village, it being part of their of¬ fice to see that such people may earn their bread by their labour ; some are set to blow the smith’s bel¬ lows, others to press palm oil, or grind colours for their mats, and sell provision in the markets. The young men are listed to serve as soldiers, so that they suffer no common beggar.” Bosman ascribes a fur- * Bosman, ther reason for this good order *, viz. “ that when a p.119. negro finds he cannot subsist, he binds himself for a certain sum of money, and the master to whom he is bound is obliged to find him necessaries; that the ma¬ ster sets him a sort of task, which is not in the least slavish, being chiefly to defend his master on occa¬ sions, or in sowing time to work as much as himself pleases.” Adjoining to the kingdom of Whidah are several small governments, as Goto, great and small Popo, Ardrah, &c. all situated on the Slave Coast, where the chief trade for slaves is carried on. These are govern¬ ed by their respective kings, and follow much the same customs with those of Whidah, except that their prin¬ cipal living is on plunder and the slave-trade",,GN,6,Guinea,Africa
"4. Next adjoining to the Slave Coast, is the king¬ dom of Benin, which, though it extends but about 170 miles on the sea, yet spreads so far inland as to lie esteemed the most potent kingdom in Guinea. By accounts, the soil and produce appear to be in a great f Collect, measure like those before described, and the natives vob iii. are represented as a reasonable good-natured people",,"BJ,GN",6,"Benin,Guinea","Africa,Africa"
"P- Avtua says f, “ they are a sincere, inoffensive people, $ and do no injustice either to one another or to stran- Quines, gers.” Smith confirms this account, and says, “ that«—, the inhabitants are generally very good-natured, and exceeding courteous and civil. W hen the Europeans make them presents, which in their coming thither to trade they always do, they endeavour to return them doubly.” Bosman tells us, “ that his countrymen the Dutch, who were often obliged to trust them till they returned the next year, were sure to be honestly paid their whole debts.” There is in Benin a considerable order in govern¬ ment ; theft, murder, and adultery, being severely punished. Smith says, “ their towns are governed by officers appointed by the king, who have power to decide in civil cases, and to raise the public taxes : but in criminal cases, they must send to the king’s court, which is held at the town of Oedo or Great Benin. This town, which covers a large extent of ground, is about 60 miles from the sea.” Barbot tells us, “ that it contains 30 streets, 20 fathoms wide, and almost two miles long, commonly extending in a straight line from one gate to another j that the gates are guarded by soldiers j that in these streets markets are held every day, for cattle, ivory, cotton, and many sorts of European goods. This large town is divided into several wards or districts, each governed by its respective king of a street, as they call them, to admi¬ nister justice, and to keep good order. The inhabi¬ tants are very civil and good-natured, condescending to what the Europeans require of them in ,a civil way.” The same author confirms what has been said by others of their justice in the payment of their debts j and adds, “ that they, above all other Guineans, are very ho¬ nest and just in their dealings *, and they have such an aversion for theft, that by the law of the country it is punished with death.” We are told by the same au¬ thor, “ that the king of Benin is able upon occasion to maintain an army of 100,000 men j but that, for the most part, he does not keep 30,000.” See the ar¬ ticle Benin",,"BJ,NL",6,"Benin,Netherlands","Africa,Europe"
"5. The last division of Guinea from which slaves are imported, are the kingdoms of Congo and Angola: these lie to the south of Benin, extending with the interme¬ diate land about 1200 miles on the coast. Great num¬ bers of the natives of both these kingdoms profess the Christian religion, which was long since introduced by the Portuguese, who made early settlements in that country. See Congo and Angola",,"AO,GN,BJ,PT",6,"Angola,Guinea,Benin,Portugal","Africa,Africa,Africa,Europe"
"In the Collection it is said, that both in Congo and Angola, the soil is in general fruitful, producing great plenty of grain, Indian corn, and such quantities of rice, that it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots, and palm oil in plenty. The natives are generally a quiet people, who discover a good understanding, and behave in a friendly manner to strangers, being of a mild conversation, affable, and easily overcome with reason. In the government of Congo, the king ap¬ points a judge in every particular division, to hear ami determine disputes and civil causes ; the judges im¬ prison and release, or impose fines, according to the rule of custom ; but in weighty matters, every one may appeal to the king, before whom all criminal causes are brought, in which he giveth sentence •, bat seldom condemneth to death. The town of Leanga stands in the midst of four lordships, which abound ia corn, G U I [ corn, fruit, &c. Here they make great quantities of cloth of divers kinds, very fine and curious ; the in¬ habitants are seldom idle; they even make needle-work caps as they walk in the streets. The slave-trade is here principally managed by the Portuguese, who carry it far up into the inland countries. They are said to send off from these parts 15,000 slaves each year. At Angola, about the tenth degree of south latitude, ends the trade for slaves",,"AO,IN,PT",6,"Angola,India,Portugal","Africa,Asia,Europe"

"J he most ancient account we have of the country History of of the negroes, particularly that part situated on and t^ie ^u^Ilea between the two great rivers of Senegal and Gambia,tra(,e' is from the writings of two ancient authors, one an Arabian, and the other a Moor. The first wrote in Arabic about the 12th century. His works, printed in that language at Rome, were afterwards translated into Latin, and printed at Paris under the patronage of the famous Thuanus chancellor of France, with the title of Geographia Nuhtensis, containing an account of all the nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia. The other was written by John Leo, a Moor, born at Grana¬ da in Spain, before the Moors were totally expelled from that kingdom. He resided in Afi ica ; but being on a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken by some Ita¬ lian corsairs, who finding him possessed of several Arabian books, besides his own manuscripts, appre¬ hended him to be a man of learning, and as such pre¬ sented him to Pope Leo X. This pope encouraging him, he embraced the Romish religion, and his de¬ scription of Africa was published in Italian. From these writings we gather, that after the Mahometan religion had extended to the kingdom of Morocco, some of the promoters of it crossing the sandy deserts of Numidia, which separate that country from Gui¬ nea, found it inhabited by men, who, though under no regular government, and destitute of that know¬ ledge the Arabians were favoured with, lived in con¬ tent and peace. The first author particularly remarks, “ that they never made war, or travelled abroad, but employed themselves in tending their herds, or labour¬ ing in the ground.” J. Leo says, p. 65. “ That they lived in common, having no property in land, no tyrant nor superior lord, but supported themselves in an equal state, upon the natural produce of the coun¬ try, which afforded plenty of roots, game, and honey","Rome, Paris, Tripoli, Tunis","SN,GM,US,FR,ES,MA,LY,TN,IT",6,"Senegal,Gambia,United States,France,Spain,Morocco,Libya,Tunisia,Italy","Africa,Africa,North America,Europe,Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Europe"
"That ambition or avarice never drove them into foreign countries to subdue or cheat their neighbours. Thus they lived without toil or superfluities.”—“ The an¬ cient inhabitants of Morocco, who wore coats of mail, and used swords and spears beaded with iron, coming amongst these harmless and naked people, soon brought them under subjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gambia into 15 parts ; those were the 15 kingdoms of the negroes, over which the Moors presided, and the common peo¬ ple were negroes. These Moors taught the negroes the Mahometan religion, and arts of life; particularly the use of iron, before unknown to them. About the 14th century, a native negro, called Heli Isc/iia, expelled the Moorish conquerors ; but though the ne¬ groes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a negro master. Heli Ischia himself becoming king, led the negroes on to foreign wars, a.id established himself in power over a very large S extent G U I [ 138 ] GUI Since Leo’s time, the Europe- night, would surprise some fishermen’s villages: that entered into the country, and carried off Guinea, extent of country.” —-vr——’ ans have had very little knowledge ot those parts ot Africa, nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly probable that it broke into pieces, and that the natives again resumed many of their an¬ cient customs j for in the account published by Moore, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Moorish and Mahometan customs, joined with the original simplicity of the negroes. It appears by accounts of ancient voyages, collected by Hackluit, Purchas, and others, that it was about 50 years before the discovery of America, that the Portuguese at¬ tempted to sail round Cape Bojador, which lies be¬ tween their country and Guinea : this, after divers repulses occasioned by the violent currents, they effected ; when landing on the western coasts of Africa, they soon began to make incursions into the country, and to seize and carry off the native inha¬ bitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gon¬ zales, the first who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coast, pursued and attacked a number of them, when some were wounded, as was also one of the Portuguese *, which the author re¬ cords as the first blood spilt by Christians in those parts. Six years after, the same Gonzales again at¬ tacked the natives and took 12 prisoners, with whom he returned to his vessels : he afterwards put a woman on shore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the prisoners j but the next day 150 of the inhabitants ap¬ peared on horses and camels, provoking the Portu¬ guese to land *, which they not daring to venture, the natives discharged a volley of stones at them, and went off. After this, the Portuguese still continued to send vessels on the coast of Africa : particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled, and, being pursued, 25 were taken ; “ he that ran best (says the author), taking the most.” In their way home they killed some of the natives, and took 55 more prisoners. Afterwards Dinisanes Dagrama, with two other vessels, landed on the island Arguin, where they took 54 Moors*, then running along the coast 80 leagues farther, they at several times took 50 slaves ; but here seven of the Portuguese were killed",Moore,"PT,GN,GM,MA,SN,US,LY",6,"Portugal,Guinea,Gambia,Morocco,Senegal,United States,Libya","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Africa"
"Then being joined by several other vessels, Dinisanes proposed to destroy the island, to revenge the loss of the seven Portuguese j of which the Moors being apprised, fled, so that no more than 12 were found, whereof only four could be taken, the rest being killed, as also one of the Portuguese.” Many more captures of this kind on the coast of Barbary and Guinea are re¬ corded to have been made in those early times by the Portuguese 5 who, in the year 1481, erected their first fort at D’Elmina on that coast, from whence they soon opened a trade for slaves with the inland parts of Guinea",Elmina,"PT,GN,GH",6,"Portugal,Guinea,Ghana","Europe,Africa,Africa"
"Anderson, in his History of Trade and Commerce, p. 336. speaking of what passed in the year 1308, writes, “ That the Spaniards had by this time found that the miserable Indian natives, whom they had made to work in their mines and fields, were not so ro¬ bust and proper for those purposes as negroes brought from Africa: wherefore they, about that time, began to import negroes for that end into Hispaniola, from the Portuguese settlements on the Guinea coasts j and also afterwards for their sugar-works.” It was about the year 1551, towards the latter end of the reign of Edward VI. when some London mer¬ chants sent out the first English ship on a trading voy¬ age to the coast of Guinea. This was soon followed by several others to the same parts $ but the English not having then any plantations in the West Indies, and consequently no occasion for negroes, such ships tra¬ ded only for gold, elephants teeth, and Guinea pepper","Anderson, London","GN,UK,US,GB,IN,PT",6,"Guinea,N/A,United States,United Kingdom,India,Portugal","Africa,N/A,North America,Europe,Asia,Europe"
"This trade was carried on at the hazard ot losing their ships and cargoes, if they had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese, who claimed an exclusive right of trade, on account of the several settlements they had made there. In 1553, we find Captain Thomas Wind¬ ham trading along the coast with 140 men, in three ships, and sailing as far as Benin, which lies about 3000 miles down the coast, to take in a load of pep¬ per. Next year John Eoke traded along the coast of Guinea, as far as D’Elmina, when he brought away considerable quantities of gold and ivory. He speaks well of the natives, and says, “ That whoever will deal with them must behave civilly, for they will not traffic if ill used.” In 1555, William Towerson traded in a peaceable manner with the natives, who made com¬ plaint to him of the Portuguese, who were then settled in their castle at D’Elmina $ saying, “ Jhey were bad men who made them slaves if they could take them, putting irons on their legs.” This bad example of the Portuguese was soon fol¬ lowed by some evil-disposed Englishmen : for the same Captain Towerson relates *, “ That in the course of* Cell his voyage, he perceived the natives near D’Elmina un-fcc»>’ willing to come to him, and that he was at last attack-P'5 ed by them j which he understood was done in revenge for the wrong done them the year before by one Cap¬ tain Gains!), who had taken away the negro captain’s son and three others, with their gold, &c. Tins caused them to join the Portuguese, notwithstanding their hatred of them, against the English.” The next year Captain Towerson brought these men back again; whereupon the negroes showed him much kindness","Elmina, Elmina, Elmina","PT,GH,BJ,GN,UK",6,"Portugal,Ghana,Benin,Guinea,N/A","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,N/A"
"“ That when Captain Hawkins returned from his first voyage to Africa, Queen Elizabeth sent for him, when she expressed her concern, lest any of the African ne¬ groes should be carried off without their free consent ; which she declared would be detestable, and would call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.” Hawkins made great promises, which nevertheless he did not perform ; for his next voyage to the coast ap¬ pears to have been principally calculated to procure negro slaves, in order to sell them to the Spaniards in the West Indies 5 which occasioned the same author to use these remarkable words: “ Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into slavery ; an in¬ justice and barbarity which, so sure as there is ven¬ geance in heaven for the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction of all who act or who encou¬ rage it.” This Captain Hawkins, afterwards Sir John Hawkins, seems to have been the first Englishman who gave public countenance to this wicked traffic : for Anderson, before mentioned, at p. 401. says, “ That in the year 1562, Captain Hawkins, assisted by sub¬ scription of sundry gentlemen, now fitted out three ships ; and having learnt that negroes were a very good commodity in Hispaniola, he sailed to the coast of Guinea, took in negroes, and sailed with them for Hispaniola, where he sold them, and his English com¬ modities, and loaded his three vessels with hides, sugar, ginger, See. with which he returned home anno 1563, making a prosperous voyage.” As it proved a lucra¬ tive business, the trade was continued both by Haw¬ kins and others, as appears from the Naval Chronicle, p. 55.: where it is said, “ That on the 18th of Octo¬ ber 1564, Captain John Hawkins, with two ships of 700 and 140 tons, sailed for Africa ; that on the 8th of December they anchored to the south of Cape Verd, where the captain manned the boat, and sent 80 men in armour into the country, to see if they could take some negroes ; but the natives flying from them, they returned to their ships, and proceeded farther down the coast. Here they staid certain days, send¬ ing their meii. ashore, in order (as the author says) to burn and spoil their towns and take the inhabitants",Anderson,"GN,US,UK",6,"Guinea,United States,N/A","Africa,North America,N/A"
"The land they observed to be well cultivated, there being plenty of grain and fruit of several sorts, and the tawns prettily laid out. On the 25th, being in- ffirmed by the Portuguese of a town of negroes called Bytnba, where there was not only a quantity of gold, but 140 inhabitants, they resolved to attack it, ha¬ ving the Portuguese for their guide j but by misma¬ nagement they took but ten negroes, having seven of their own men killed and 27 wounded. They then went farther down the coast; when having procured a number ot negroes, they proceeded to the West In- ies, w lere they sold them to the Spaniards.” And in the same Naval Chronicle, at p. 76. it is said, “ That in the year I5^7» Francis Drake, before performing Guinea.",,"PT,GN",6,"Portugal,Guinea","Europe,Africa"
"his voyage round the world, went with Sir John Haw- v J kins in his expedition to the coast of Guinea, where taking in a cargo of slaves, they determined to steer for the Caribbee islands.” How Queen Elizabeth suf¬ fered so grievous an infringement of the rights of man¬ kind to be perpetrated by her subjects, and how she was persuaded, about the 30th year of her reign, to grant patents for carrying on a trade from the north part of the river Senegal to 100 leagues beyond Sierra Leona, which gave rise to the African Company See Cowi- is hard to account for, any otherwise than that it?;<wi/> vol",Elizabeth,"GN,SN,US",6,"Guinea,Senegal,United States","Africa,Africa,North America"
"behalf of the college of cardinals, or great council at^' Home, to the missionaries in Congo, complaining that the pernicious and abominable abuse of selling slaves was yet continued ; requiring them to remedy the same if possible *, but this the missionaries saw little hopes of accomplishing, by reason that the trade of the country lay wholly in slaves and ivory.” It has been rw ged in justification of this trade, that by purchasing the captives taken in battle, they save the lives of so many human creatures, who otherwise would be sacrificed to the implacable revenge of the victors. But this pretence has been refuted by an ap¬ peal to reason and fact. For if the negroes appre¬ hended they should be cruelly put to death if they yvere not sent away ; why, it is asked, do they mani¬ fest such reluctance and dread as they generally do, at being brought from their native country ? Smith, in his Account, p. 28. says, “ The Gambians abhor slavery, and will attempt any thing, though ever so desperate, to avoid it.” And Thomas Philips, in his account of a voyage he performed to the coast of Guinea, writes, “ They (the negroes) are so loth to leave their own country, that they have often leaped out of the canoe, boat, or ship, into the sea, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up.” But had the fact even been otherwise, the above plea is urged with an extreme bad grace, when it is notorious that the very wars said to be pro¬ ductive of such cruelty were fomented by the infamous arts of the Europeans. From the foregoing accounts, as well as other authentic publications of this kind, it appears, that it was the unwarrantable lust of gain which first stimulated the Portuguese, and afterwards other Europeans, to engage in this horrid traffic. By the most unquestionable relations of those early times, the natives were an inoffensive people, who, when civil¬ ly used, traded amicably with the Europeans. It is recorded of those of Benin, the largest kingdom in Guinea, that they were a gentle, loving people ; and Reynold says, “ They found more sincere proofs of S 2 love GUI [ 140 ] GUI Guinea, love ami good will from tlie natives, tlian they ctuld find from the Spaniards and Portuguese, even though they had relieved them from the greatest misery.” And from the same relations there is no reason to think otherwise, but that they generally lived in peace amongst themselves : there occurring no accounts of any wars at that early period, nor of any sale of cap¬ tives taken in battle",,"GN,PT,BJ",6,"Guinea,Portugal,Benin","Africa,Europe,Africa"
"In fact, it was long after the Portuguese had made a practice of violently forcing the natives of Africa into slavery, that we read of the diQerent negro nations making war upon each other, and selling their cap¬ tives. And probably this was not the case, till those bordering on the coast, who had been used to supply the vessels with necessaries, had become corrupted by their intercourse with the Europeans, and were excited by drunkenness and avarice to join them in carrying on those wicked schemes, by which those unnatural wars were perpetrated, the inhabitants kept in con¬ tinual alarms, the country laid waste, and, as Moore expresses it, “ infinite numbers sold into slavery.” But that the Europeans are the principal cause of these de¬ vastations, is particularly evidenced by one whose con¬ nection with the trade would rather induce him to represent it in the fairest colours, viz. Captain Smith, the person sent in the year 1726, by the African com¬ pany, to survey their settlements j who, from the in¬ formation he received of one of the factors who had re¬ sided ten years in that country, says, “ That the dis¬ cerning natives account it their greatest unhappiness, * Smith, that they were ever visited by tbe Europeans*.—That p. z66, we Christians introduced the traffic of slaves; and that before our coming they lived in peace.” In the accounts relating to the African trade, w'e find this melancholy truth farther asserted by some of the principal directors in the different factories: par- f Cn/iection, ticularly A. Brue says f, “ That the Europeans were far from desiring to act as peace-makers amongst the p. 9S, negroes ; which would be acting contrary to their in¬ terest, since tbe greater the wars, the more slaves were . procured.” And William Bosman also remarksJ, “ That J'- ^ ' one of the former commanders gave large sums of money to the negroes of one nation, to induce them to attack some of the neighbouring nations; which oc¬ casioned a battle which was more bloody than the wars of the negroes usually are.” This is confirmed by J. Barbot, who says, “ That the country of D’El- mina, which was formerly very powerful and populous, was in his time so much drained of its Inhabitants by the intestine wars fomented among tbe negroes by tbe Dutch, that there did not remain inhabitants enough to till the country.” It has also been advanced as an argument in favour of keeping the negroes in bondage, that there are slaves in Guinea, and that those amongst us might be so in their own country. Not to dwell upon the incon¬ sistency of our giving any countenance to slavery, be¬ cause the Africans, whom we esteem a barbarous and savage people, allow of it, and perhaps the more from our example ; the very circumstance stated, when in¬ quired into, must afford cause of blushing, rather than serve as a palliation of such iniquitous conduct: for it will appear, that the slavery endured in Guinea is by no means so grievous as that in the colonies. Captain Moore, speaking of the natives living on the river Gam¬ bia, says, “ That some of the negroes have many house r ","Moore, Moore","GN,US,PT,NL",6,"Guinea,United States,Portugal,Netherlands","Africa,North America,Europe,Europe"
"And that though in some parts of Africa they sell their slaves born in the family, yet on the river Gam¬ bia they think it a very wficked thing.” The author adds, “ He never heard of but one that ever sold a family slave, except for such crimes as they would have been sold for if they had been free.” And in Astley’s Collection, speaking of the customs of the negroes in that large extent of country farther down the coast, particularly denominated the Coast of Guinea, it is said, “ They have not many slaves on the coast: none but the king or nobles are permitted to buv or sell any; so that they are allowed only what are ne¬ cessary for their families or tilling the ground.”'' The same author adds, “ That they generally use their slaves well, and seldom conect them.” From the foregoing accounts of the natural disposi¬ tion of the negroes, and the fruitfulness of most parts of Guinea, which are confirmed by authors of candour, who have written from their own knowledge, it may well be concluded, that the negroes acquaintance with the Europeans might have been a happiness to them: but these, forgetful of their duty as men and Chri¬ stians, have conducted themselves in so iniquitous a manner, as must necessarily raise in the minds of the thoughtful and well-disposed negroes the utmost scorn and detestation of the very name of Christians. All other considerations have given way to an insatiable desire of gain, which has beefi the principal and mo¬ ving cause of the most detestable and barbarous scene that was perhaps ever acted upon the face of the earth *, instead of making use of that superior knowledge with which the Almighty, the common Parent of mankind, had favoured them, to strengthen the principle of peace and good will in the breasts of the incautious negroes, the Europeans have, by their bad example, led them into excess of drunkenness, debauchery, and avarice: whereby every passion of corrupt nature be¬ ing inflamed, they have been easily prevailed upon to make war and captivate one another, as well to fur¬ nish means for the excesses they had been habituated to, as to satisfy the greedy desire of gain in their pro¬ fligate employers; who to this intent have furnished them with prodigious quantities of arms and ammuni¬ tion. I bus they have been hurried into confusion, distress, and all the extremities of temporal misery ; every thing, even the power of their kings, has been made subservient to this wicked purpose ; for instead of being protectors of their subjects, some of those ru¬ lers, corrupted by the excessive love of spirituous li¬ quors, and the tempting baits laid before them by the factors, have invaded the liberties.of their unhappy sub¬ jects, and are become their oppressors",,GN,6,Guinea,Africa
"Here it may be necessary to observe, that the ac¬ counts we have of the inhabitants of Guinea are chiefly given by persons engaged in the trade, who, from self-interested views, have described them in such colours as were least likely to excite compassion and respect, and endeavoured to reconcile so manifest a violation of the rights of mankind to the minds of the purchasers; yet they cannot but allow the negroes to be possessed of some good qualities,, though they con.* trive GUI [ i j&i >a trive as much as possible to cast a shade over them. A Ju particular instance of this appears in Astley’s Collec¬ tion, vol. ii. p. 73. where the author, speaking of the Mandingos settled at Galem, which is situated 900 miles np the Senegal, after saying that they carry on a commerce to all the neighbouring kingdoms, and amass riches, adds, “ That excepting the vices pecu¬ liar to the blacks, they are a good sort of people, ho¬ nest, hospitable, just to their word, laborious, industri¬ ous, and very ready to learn arts and sciences.” Here it is difficult to imagine what vices can be peculiarly attendant on a people so well disposed as the author de¬ scribes these to be. With respect to the charge some authors have brought against them, as being void of all natural affection, it is frequently contradicted by others.

"the negroes of North Guinea and the Gold Coast are said to be fond of their children, whom they love with tenderness. And Bosman says, p. 340. “ Not a few in his country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine, that pa¬ rents here sell their children, men their wives, and one brother the other: but those who think so, deceive themselves 5 for this never happens on any other ac¬ count but that of necessity, or some great crime.” The same is repeated by J. Barbot, p. 326. and also confirmed by Sir Hans Sloane in the introduction to his natural history of Jamaica ; where, speaking of the negroes, he says, “ they are usually thought to be ha¬ ters of their own children ; and therefore it is believed that they sell and dispose of them to strangers for mo¬ ney : but this is not true •, for the negroes of Guinea being divided into several captainships, as well as the Indians of America, have wars ; and besides those slain in battle, many prisoners are taken, who are sold as slaves, and brought thither : but the parents here, al¬ though their children are slaves for ever, yet have so great love for them, that no masters dare sell or give away one of their little ones unless they care not whe¬ ther their parents hang themselves or not.” J. Bar¬ bot, speaking of the occasion of the natives of Guinea being represented as a treacherous people, ascribes it to the Hollanders (and doubtless other Europeans) usurp¬ ing authority, and fomenting divisions between the ne¬ groes. At p. no. he says, “ It is well known that many of the European nations, trading amongst these people, have very unjustly and inhumanly, without any provocation, stolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coast, but almost every¬ where in Guinea, who have come on board their ships in a harmless and confiding manner : these they have in great numbers carried away, and sold in the plantations, with other slaves which they had purchased.” And al¬ though some of the negroes may he justly charged with indolence and supineness, yet many others are frequent¬ ly mentioned by authors as a careful, industrious, and even laborious people","Gold Coast, Holland, Bar","GN,JM,AU,US,UA",6,"Guinea,Jamaica,Australia,United States,Ukraine","Africa,North America,Oceania,North America,Europe"
"By an inquiry into the laws and customs formerly in use, and still in force among the negroes, particularly on the Gold Coast, it will be found, that provision was made for the general peace, and for the safety of indi¬ viduals j even in W. Bosman’s time, long after the Europeans had established the slave-trade, the natives were not publicly enslaved, any otherwise than in pu¬ nishment for crimes, when prisoners of war, or by a M J GUI violent exertion of the power of their corrupted kings.

"Moore also mentions man-stealing as being discounte¬ nanced by the negro governments on the river Gambia ; and speaks of the enslaving the peaceable inhabitants, as a violence which only happens under a corrupt admi¬ nistration of justice. He says, “ The kings of that country generally advise with their head men, scarcely- doing any thing of consequence without consulting them first, except the king of Barsailay, who being subject to hard drinking, is very absolute. It is to this king’s insatiable thirst for brandy, that his subjects freedoms and families are in so precarious a situation",Moore,"GM,US",6,"Gambia,United States","Africa,North America"
"The king had recourse to this method, by seizing 300 of h is own people, and sent word to the director that he had the slaves ready to deliver for the goods.” It seems the king wanted double the quantity of goods whick gui [m Guinea, which the factor would give him for these 300 slaves j 'w-v "" ""> but the factor refusing to trust him as be was already in the company’s debt, and perceiving that this refusal had put the king much out ol temper, he proposed that he should give him a licence lor taking so many more of bis people as the goods he still wanted were worth: but this the king refused, saying, “ It might occasion a disturbance among his subjects.” Except in the above instance, and some others, where the power of the negro kings is unlawfully exerted over their subjects, the slave-trade is carried on in Guinea with some regard to the laws of the country, which al¬ low of none to be sold but prisoners taken in their national wars, or people adjudged to slavery in punish¬ ment for crimes •, but the largeness of the country, the number of kingdoms or commonwealths, and the great encouragement given by the Europeans, afford frequent pretences and.opportunities to the bold designing profli¬ gates of one kingdom, to surprise and seize upon not only those of a neighbouring government, but also the weak and helpless of their own j and the unhappy peo¬ ple taken on those occasions, are, with impunity, sold to the Europeans. These practices are doubtless disap¬ proved of by the most considerate amongst the negroes $ for Bosnian acquaints us, that even their rational wars are not agreeable to such. He says, “ If the person who occasioned the beginning of the war be taken, they will not easily admit him to ransom, though his weight of gold should be offered, for fear he should in future form some new design against their repose.” We shall conclude this article with the following ac¬ count of the shocking methods used in the carrying on of the slave-trade, as described by factors of different nations, * AtUey, Mr Moore *, factor for the English African Com- vol.ii p. sS. pany on the river Gambia, writes, “ That there are a number of negro traders, called /o/zcoes, or merchants, who follow the slave-trade as a business j their place of residence is so high up the country as to be six weeks travel from James Fort, which is situated at the mouth of that river. These merchants bring down elephants teeth, and in some years 2000 slaves, most of which, they say, are prisoners taken in war. They buy them from the different princes who take them ; many of them are Bumbrongs and Petcharies ; nations who each of them have different languages, and are brought from a vast way inland. Their way of bringing them is tying them by the neck with leather thongs, at about a yard distant from each other, 30 or 40 in a string, having generally a bundle of corn or elephants teeth upon each of their heads. In their way from the mountains, they travel through very great woods, where they cannot for some days get water $ so they carry in skin bags enough to support them for a time",,"GN,GM,BA",6,"Guinea,Gambia,Bosnia and Herzegovina","Africa,Africa,Europe"
"I cannot (adds Moore) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade, but there may, per¬ haps, be about 100, who go up into the inland country with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them purchase, in various coun¬ tries, gold, slaves, and elephants teeth. Besides the slaves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: These are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes j ot' else people stolen, which is very frequent.—Smcz the 2 ] GUI slave-trade has been used, all punishments are changed Gab* into slavery ; there being an advantage on such con- demnation, they strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the criminal.’1'' John Barbot, the French factor, in bis account of the manner by which the slaves are procured, says, “ The slaves sold by the negroes are for the most part prisoners of war, or taken in the incursions they make into their enemies territories j others are stolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods’, or else in the corn-fields, at the time of the year when their parents keep them there all the day to scare away the devouring small birds.” Speaking of the transactions on that part of Guinea called the Slave Coast, where the Europeans have the most facto¬ ries, and from whence they bring away much the greatest number of slaves, the same author says, “The inhabitants of Goto do much mischief in stealing those slaves they sell to the Europeans from the upland country.———That the inhabitants of Popo excel the former $ being endowed with a much larger share of courage, they rob more successfully, by which means they increase their riches and trade.” The author par¬ ticularly remarks, “ That they are encouraged in this practice by the Europeans: sometimes it happens, ac¬ cording to the success of their inland excursions, that they are able to furnish 200 slaves or more in a few days.” And he says, “ The blacks of Fida, or Whi- dah, are so expeditious in trading for slaves, that they can deliver 1000 every month.”—“ If there happens to be no stock of slaves there, the factor must trust the blacks with his goods, to the value of 150I. or 200I",Moore,"GN,US,FR",6,"Guinea,United States,France","Africa,North America,Europe"
"Their intention was to follow up the abolition by plans for diffusing civilization among the inhabitants of Western Africa. In the prosecution of this object, warned by the fate of the Sierra Leon Company, they kept clear of all commercial enterprises. They sent agents, however, to Sierra Leon to supply them with information. They have encouraged individuals to study the Arabic and other languages spoken in Guinea, as a means of spreading more accurate ideas here re¬ garding the inhabitants, and the productions of the Guinea, country. They have sent out African youths, previous- ly trained in Britain, to instruct their countrymen in the more simple and useful branches of elementary knowledge, and in some of the common arts. They have also sent out cotton seed and other useful plants, with instructions as to the mode of culture $ and what was of no less importance, they were sedulously active in detecting all violations of the acts for the abolition of the slave trade, which they justly considered as the greatest obstruction to the civilization of Western Africa. It appears, that under their auspices some progress has been made in introducing peaceful habits and useful arts at Sierra Leon, and in some part of the neighbouring country ; but the continuance of the slave trade, by Spain and Portugal, has presented a for¬ midable obstacle to their benevolent attempts j and at present we believe the supporters of the institution are less sanguine in their hopes than they were at the com¬ mencement.

"They are a strange kind of commonwealth among themselves of wandering impostors and jugglers, who made their first appearance in Germany about the be¬ ginning of the 16th century. Munster, it is true, who is followed and relied upon by Spelman, fixes the time of their first appearance to the year 1417 : as lle owns that the first whom he ever saw were in 1529, it is probably an error of the press for 1517 ; especially as other historians inform us, that when Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in the year 1517, several of the na¬ tives refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and re¬ volted under one Zinganeus ; whence the Turks call them Zinganees ; but being at length surrounded and ■ banished, they agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of su¬ perstition and credulity. In the compass of a very few years they gained such a number of idle proselytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and be¬ took themselves to the same arts of chiromancy, beg¬ ging, and pilfering), that they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.— Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1560, and from Spain in 1591. And the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in 1530 they are described by Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. as “ an outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, i> using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have come into this realm, and gone from shire to shire, and place to place, in great companies, and used great, subtle, ‘ and crafty means to deceive the people ; bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men’s and ( women’s fortunes ; and so many times by craft and shb- tility have deceived the people of their money, and also ► have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.” t Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, and forfei¬ ture of their goods and chattels ; and upon their trials > for any felony which they may have committed, they shall not be entitled to a jury de medietate linguce. And afterwards it is enacted, by statutes 1st and 2d Ph. and Mary, c. 4. and 5th Eliz. c. 20. that if any such per¬ sons shall he imported into the kingdom, the importer shall forfeit 40I. And if the Egyptians themselves re¬ main one month in the kingdom, or if any person be- ing 14 years old, whether natural-born subject or stran¬ ger, which hath been seen or found in the fellowship of such Egyptians, or which hath disguised him or her¬ self like them, shall remain in the same one month at one or several times, it is felony' without benefit of clergy. And Sir M. Hale informs us, that at one Suf¬ folk assizes no less than 13 persons were executed upon these statutes a few years before the Restoration.

"Their language differs entirely from the Coptic; and their customs are very different from those of the Egyp¬ tians. They are indeed to be found in Egypt j but they wander about there as strangers, and form a di¬ stinct people, as in other countries. The expressions of Bellonius are strong and decisive : “ No part of the world, I believe, is free from those banditti, wander¬ ing about in troops, whom we by mistake call Egyp¬ tians and Bohemians. When we were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of these strolling thieves sitting under palm trees j and they are esteemed foreigners in Egypt as well as among us.” The Egyptian descent of the gypsies being rejected, Gypsies, our author next endeavours to show that they come ''——y—— from Hindostan. The chief basis of his theory, how¬ ever, is no other than that very dubious one, a simila¬ rity of language. He adds a long vocabulary of the gypsy and the Hindostanic languagesin which, it must be confessed, many words are the same y but ma¬ ny are difterent. A principal proof which he adduces on this head is from the relation of Captain Szekely von Doha, to whom a printer in 1763 related, that a preacher of the Reformed church, when a student at Leyden, being intimately acquainted with three young Malabar students, took down laoo of their words, which he fancied corresponded with the gypsy language; and they added, that a tract of land in their island was named Ozigania. He repeated these words to the Ra— her gypsies, who explain them without trouble or hesi¬ tation. This account was published in the Vienna Ga¬ zette. Supposing these three young men to be sons of Bramins, who use the Sanscrit, the common language of Hindostan comes as near to that as modern Italian to pure Latin. The comparison of the two languages takes up above 30 pages ; and Mr Grellman thinks it establishes his system. The same opinion is maintained by Mr Marsden, in a paper upon this subject in the 7th volume of the Archeologia. The numerals, however, both in Hindostanic and gypsy, differ greatly as stated by the two authors. And here, as in other such com¬ parisons, one is astonished at the credulity of the com¬ parers of orthoepy and orthography (as a periodical cri¬ tic observes), which can have no connection in langua¬ ges with which we are not perfectly familiar, even were both languages reduced to writing by their respective people : how much less, then, where one of the two languages is never reduced to writing, as is the case of the gypsy, but it is blended with the language of the country where the clan resides ? This appears from the correspondence of several words in all languages with the gypsy. Mr Grellman acknowledges the two gypsy versions of the Lord’s Prayer, at different periods, differ so widely, that one would almost be inclined to doubt whether they were really the same language. We think we can discern a few words differently indeed written, but probably pronounced alike. Nor can we, in all the languages in which Chamberlayne gives the Lord’s Prayer, perceive the least resemblance to the gypsy name of father, Dade and Dady except in the Welsh, Taad. In prosecuting his argument, Mr Grellm&n does not insist on the similarity of colour between the two people, nor on the cowardice common to both, nor on the attachment of the Indians to tents, or letting their children go naked ; all these being traits to be met with in other nations: but he dwells on the word Polgar, the name of one of the first gypsy leaders, and of the Hindostanic god of marriage; also on the corres¬ pondence between the travelling smiths in the two peo¬ ple, who carry two pair of bellows ; the Indian’s boy blows them in India, the wife or child ot the gypsy in Europe : as if every travelling tinker, in every nation where tinkers travel, had not the same journeymen","Cairo, Doha","EG,IN,QA,IT,GB",6,"Egypt,India,Qatar,Italy,United Kingdom","Africa,Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe"

In these the pro¬ phet complains very pathetically of the disorders which he observed in the kingdom of Judaea.

"In after-times, the Anglo-Saxons and Danes also considered fine hair as one of the greatest beauties and ornaments of their persons, and were at no little pains in dressing it to advantage. Young ladies before niai’- riage wore their hair uncovered and untied, flowing in ringlets over their shoulders; but as soon as they were married, they cut it shorter, tied it up, and put on a head-dress of some kind or other, according to the pre¬ vailing fashion. To have the hair entirely cut off was so gieat a disgrace, that it was one of the greatest pu¬ nishments inflicted on those women who were guilty of adultery. The Danish soldiers who were quartered up¬ on the English, in the reigns of Edgar the Peaceable and of Ethelred the Unready, were the beaux of those times, and were particularly attentive to the dressing of their hair ; which they combed at least once every day, and thereby captivated the affections of the Eng¬ lish ladies. The clergy, both secular and regular, were obliged to shave the crowns of their heads, and keep their hair short, which distinguished them from the laity } aud several canons were made against their con¬ cealing their tonsure, or allowing their hair to grow long. The shape of this clerical tonsure was the sub¬ ject of long and violent debates between the English clergy on the one hand, and those of the Scots and Piets on the other ; that of the former being circular, and that of the latter only semicircular. It appears very plainly, that long flowing hair was universally esteemed a great ornament; and the tonsure of the clergy was considered as an act of mortification and self-denial, to which many of them submitted with re¬ luctance, and endeavoured to conceal as much as pos¬ sible. Some of them who affected the reputation of su¬ perior sanctity inveighed with great bitterness against the long hair of the laity ; and laboured earnestly to persuade them to cut it short, in imitation of the cler¬ gy. Ihus the famous St Wulstan bishop of Worcester, is said to have declaimed with great vehemence against luxury of all kinds, hut chiefly against long hair as most criminal and most universal. “ The English (says Wil¬ liam of Malmsbury in his life of St Wulstan) were very vicious in their manners, and plunged in luxury, through the long peace which they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The holy prelate Wul¬ stan reproved the wicked of all ranks with great bold¬ ness ; hut he rebuked those with the greatest severity who were proud of their long hair. When any of those vain people bowed their heads before him to receive his blessing, before he gave it, he cut a lock of their hair with a little sharp knife, which he carried about him lor that purpose ; and commanded them, by way of penance for their sins, to cut all the rest of their hair in the same manner. If any of them refused to comply with this command, he denounced the most dreadful judgments upon them, reproached them for their effe¬ minacy, and foretold, that as they imitated women in the length of their hair, they would imitate them in their cowardice when their country was invaded • which was accomplished at the landing of the Nor¬ mans.” Ihis continued to be long a topic of declamation among ,the clergy, who even represented it as, one of the greatest crimes, and most certain marks of repro- , bation. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went so „ far as to pronounce the terrible sentence of excom¬ munication against all who wore long hair, for which pious zeal he is very much commended. Serlo, a Norman bishop, acquired great honour by a sermon which he preached before Henry I. A. D. 1104, against long and curled hair, with which the king and all his courtiers were so much affected, that they consented to resign their flowing ringlets, of which they had been so vain. The prudent prelate gave them no time to change their minds, but immediately pulled a pair of shears out of his sleeve, and performed the operation :( with his own hand. Another incident happened about j 25 years after, which gave a temporary check to the i prevailing fondness for long hair. It is thus related by a contemporary historian : “An event happened, 1 A. D. 1129, which seemed very wonderful to our | young gallants ; who, forgetting that they were men, 1 had transformed themselves into women by the length l of their hair. A certain knight, who was very proud j of his long luxuriant hair, dreamed that a person suffo- S cated him with its curls. As soon as he awoke from i his sleep, he cut his hair to a decent length. The re- 1 port of this spread over all England, and almost all i the knights reduced their hair to the proper standard. ! But this reformation was not of long continuance ; ) for in less than a year all who wished to appear fashion- i able returned to their former wickedness, and contend¬ ed with the ladies in length of hair. Those to whom nature had denied that ornament supplied the defect by art.” The Greeks, and, after their example, the Romans, wore false hair","Young, Worcester, Wil, Canterbury, Norman","UK,UY,ZA,CH,GB,US",6,"N/A,Uruguay,South Africa,Switzerland,United Kingdom,United States","N/A,South America,Africa,Europe,Europe,North America"

H HEBRON, in Ancient Geography, a very ancient city, situated in the hilly country of the tribe of Judah to the south. Its more ancient name was Kiriath Ar- ba, or Cariath Arba. In antiquity this city vied with most ancient cities of Egypt, being seven years prior to Zoan, translated Tanis by the Seventy. Jo¬ sephus makes it not only older than Tanis, but even than Memphis. It stood to the west of the lake Asphal- tites, and was for some time the royal residence of D avid. After the captivity it fell into the hands of the Edomites, as did all the south country of Judea. It is now called Habroun, situated seven leagues to the south of Bethlehem. The Arabs call it El-kalil, “ the well- beloved which is the epithet they usually apply to Abraham, whose sepulchral grotto they still show* Habroun is seated at the foot of an eminence, on which are some wretched ruins, the mishapen remains of an ancient castle. The adjacent country is a sort of ob¬ long hollow, five or six leagues in length, and not dis¬ agreeably varied by rocky hillocks, groves of fir-trees, stunted oaks, and a few plantations of vines and olive trees. These vineyards are not cultivated with a view to make wine, the inhabitants being such zealous Maho¬ metans as not to permit any Christians to live among them : they are only of use to procure dried raisins, which are badly prepared, though the grapes are of au excellent kind. The peasants cultivate cotton likewise, which is spun by their wives, and sold at Jerusalem and Gaza. They have also some soap manufactories, the kali for which is sold them by the Bedouins ; and a very ancient glass-house, the only one in Syria. They make there a great quantity of coloured rings, brace¬ lets for the wrists and legs, and for the arms above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to Constantinople. In consequence of these manufactures, Mr Volney informs us, Habroun is the most powerful village in all this quarter; and is able to arm 800 or 900 men, who adhere to the faction Kaisi, and are the perpetual enemies of the people of Beth¬ lehem. This discord, which has prevailed throughout the country from the earliest times of the Arabs, causes a perpetual civil war. The peasants are incessantly ma¬ king inroads on each other’s lands, destroying their corn, dourra, sesamum, and olive trees, and carrying off their sheep, goats, and camels. The Turks, who are everywhere negligent in repressing similar disorders, are the less attentive to them here, since their autho¬ rity is very precarious. The Bedouins, whose camps occupy the level country, are continually at open ho¬ stilities with them ; of which the peasants avail them¬ selves to resist their authority, or do mischief to each other, according to the blind caprice of their igno¬ rance or the interest of the moment. Hence arises an anarchy which is still more dreadful than the despotism which prevails elsewhere, while the mutual devastations of the contending parties render the appearance of this part of Syria more wretched than that of any other","Aurora, Memphis, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Gaza","SY,US,EG,ZA,IL,PS",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,United States,Egypt,South Africa,Israel,Palestine, State of","Asia,North America,Africa,Africa,Asia,Asia"

"HEIDEGGER, John James, was the son of a cler¬ gyman, and a native of Zurich In Switzerland, where he married, but left his country in consequence of an intrigue. Having had an opportunity of visiting the principal cities of Europe, he acquired a taste for ele¬ gant and refined pleasures, as they are called, which, united to a strong inclination for voluptuousness, by de¬ grees qualified him for the management of public amuse¬ ments. In 1708, when he was near 50 years old, he came to England on a negociation from the Swiss at Zurich ; but, failing in his embassy, he entered as a private soldier in the guards for protection. By his sprightly engaging conversation and insinuating address, he soon worked himself into the good graces of our young people of fashion ; from whom he obtained the appellation of the Swiss Count. He had the address to procure a subscription, with which, in iyop, he Was enabled to furnish out the opera of “ Thomyris,” which was written in English, and performed at the queen’s theatre in the Haymarket. The music, how¬ ever, was Italian; that is to say, airs selected from sun¬ dry of the foreign operas by Bunoncini, Scarlatti, Stef- fani, Gasparini, and Albinoni. Heidegger by this per¬ formance alone was a gainer of 500 guineas. The ju¬ dicious remarks he made on several defects in the con¬ duct of our operas in general, and the hints he threw out for improving the entertainments of the royal thea¬ tre, soon established his character as a good critic. Ap¬ peals were made to his judgment; and some very mag¬ nificent and elegant decorations introduced upon the stage in consequence of his advice, gave such satisfac¬ tion to George II. who was fond of operas, that, upon being informed to whose genius he was indebted for these improvements, his majesty was pleased from that time to countenance him, and he soon obtained the chief 19 ] HE! management of the opera-house in the Haymarket.

He was likewise appointed master of the re¬ vels. The nobility now caressed him so much, and had such an opinion of his taste, that all splendid and ele¬ gant entertainments given by them upon particular oc¬ casions, and all private assemblies by subscriptions, were submitted to his direction. From the emoluments of these several employments, he gained a regular consi¬ derable income, amounting, it is said, in some years, to 5000!. which he spent with much liberality, parti¬ cularly in the maintenance of a somewhat too luxurious table ; so that it may he said he raised an income, but never a fortune.

Now I defy the most able Englishman to go to Swit¬ zerland, and either to gain that income or to spend it there.”—Heidegger is said to have had so remarkable a memory, that he once walked from Charing-cross to Temple-bar, and back again ; and when he came home, wrote down every sign on each side of the street",,SZ,6,Eswatini,Africa

"of Scotland by his queen Anne sister of the king of Denmark, and one of the most accomplished princes of the age in which he lived, was born on the 19th of February 1594* The birth of the prince was announ¬ ced by embassies to many foreign powers, with invi¬ tations to be present at the ceremony of his baptism, which was thus delayed for a considerable time. Mr Peter Young, who, along with the celebrated George Buchanan, had been preceptor to his majesty, was sent to the courts of Denmark, Brunswic, and Meck¬ lenburg, the duke of Mecklenburg being great-grand¬ father to the prince by the mother’s side ; the laird of East ""Weems to France and England ; and Sir Robert Kieith, and Captain Murray provost of St Andrew’s, 2: to the States General, who at that time were strug¬ gling against the Spanish tyranny, and not yet declared a free state. All these ambassadors were cordially re¬ ceived, and others appointed in return except by the courts of France and England. Henry IV. at that time king of France, though the Scots ambassador had formerly been one of his own servants, neither made any present, nor appointed an ambassador. Queen Elizabeth had designed to act in the same manner till she heard of the behaviour of Henry 5 after which she honoured James by appointing an ambassador of very high rank, Robert earl of Sussex. This ambassador, however, was so long of making his appearance, that the queen imagined the ceremony would be over before his arrival; for which reason she sent a message to the earl, commanding him in that case not to enter Scot¬ land nor deliver her present. But James had been more obsequious $ and not only delayed the ceremony till the English ambassador arrived, but distinguished him from the rest by having a canopy carried over his head at the procession, supported by the lairds of Cess- ford, Buccleugh, Duddope, and Traquair. The ce¬ remony was performed with great magnificence j after which the ambassadors presented their gifts. That from the United States was the most valuable. It consisted of two gold cups worth 12,400 crowns, with a box of the same metal, weighing in all about 400 ounces, containing besides the grant of a pension of 5000 florins annually to the prince for life. The Eng¬ lish ambassador gave a cupboard of plate curiously wrought, and valued at 3000I. sterling j and the Danish ambassador two gold chains, one for the queen and another for the prince.

"Among others, he honoured with his attention the learned and eloquent Mr Joseph Hall, then rector of Halstead in Suffolk, afterwards dean of Worcester, and successively bishop of Exeter and Norwich. His high¬ ness was so much pleased with a book of Meditations published by that divine, that he pressed him to preach before h im ; and having heard two of his sermons, he engaged him as one of his chaplains ; inviting him af¬ terwards to stay constantly at his court, while the other chaplains waited only in their turns; promising, more¬ over to obtain from the king such preferments as should fully satisfy him.

"In his family the prince took the utmost care to pre¬ serve decency and regularity. He ordered boxes to be kept at his three houses of St James’s, Richmond, and Nonsuch, for the money required of those who were heard to swear ; the fines levied on such offenders be- ing given to the poor. He had, indeed, a particular aversion to the vice of swearing and profanation of the name of God. When at play, he never was heard to do so ; and on being asked why he did not srvear at play as well as others ; he answered, that he knew no game worthy of an oath. The same answer he is said to have given at a hunting-match. The stag, almost quite spent, crossed a road where a butcher was passing with his dog. The stag was instantly killed by the dog ; at which the huntsmen were greatly offended, and en¬ deavoured to irritate the prince against the butcher : but his highness answered coolly, “ What if the butch¬ er’s dog killed the stag, what could the butcher help it?” They replied, that if his father had been so served, he would have sworn so that no man could have endu¬ red. “ Away,” cried the prince, “ all the pleasure in the world is not worth an oath.” The regard which Prince Henry had for religion was manifest from his attachment to those who be¬ haved themselves in a religious and virtuous manner",Richmond,ZA,6,South Africa,Africa
"About the middle of January 1612, Prince Henrv ordered all his majesty’s master-shipwrights and build¬ ers to attend him, to consider of a proposition con¬ cerning the building of ships in Ireland made by a Mr Barrel. Some of his propositions were, that he should build any ship from iod to 600 tons, with two decks and a half, at the rate of five pounds per ton ; that he would build any ship from 6oo to xooo tons, with three whole decks, at the rate of seven pounds per ton ; that he should build a ship of 6oo tons within a certain time, &c. Mr Pett was employed to see that this contract was fulfilled on the part of Mr Bur- rel. Among the prince’s papers, a list of the royal navy was found after his death, with an account of all the expences of fitting out, manning, &c. which must now be accounted a valuable addition to the naval hi¬ story of those times. His passion for naval affairs na¬ turally led him to a desire of making geographical dis¬ coveries ; of which, however, only two instances have reached our times. One was in 1607, when he recei¬ ved from Mr Tindal his gunner, who had been em¬ ployed by the Virginia company, a draught of James’s river in that country, with a letter dated 22d June the same year. In this letter Mr Tindal remarks, that his fellow’-adventurers had discovered that river; and that no Christian had ever been there before; that they were safely arrived and settled ; that they found the coun¬ try very fruitful ; and that they had taken a real and public possession in the name and to the use of the king his highness’s father. The other instance was in the year 1612, the same in which he died, when he employed Mr Thomas Button, an eminent mariner, to go in quest of a north-west passage. Mr Button ac- cordinaly set sail with two ships, named the Resolution and Discovery; the same designations with those in which the late Captain Cook made his last voyage",Virginia,"IE,ZA",6,"Ireland,South Africa","Europe,Africa"
"Prince Henry, notwithstanding his indifference in matrimonial matters, applied himself with the utmost assiduity to his former employments and exercises, the continual fatigue of which was thought to impair his health. In the 19th year of his age his constitution seemed to undergo a remarkable change : be began to appear pale and thin, and to be more retired and se¬ rious than usual. He complained now and then of a giddiness and heavy pain in his forehead, which ob¬ liged him to stroke up his brow before he put on his hat: he frequently hied at the nose, which gave great relief, though the discharge stopped some time before his death. These forebodings of a dangerous malady were totally neglected both by himself and his attend¬ ants, even after he began to be seized at intervals with fainting fits. Notwithstanding these alarming symp¬ toms, lie continued his usual employments. On the arrival of Count de Nassau in England, he waited upon him as though nothing had been the matter 5 and when the subject of the princess Elizabeth’s mar¬ riage came to be canvassed, he interested himself deeply in the affair, and never desisted till the match with the elector palatine was concluded. In the beginning of June 16x2, the prince went to Richmond, where he continued till the progress : and notwithstanding the complaints above mentioned, he now took the oppor¬ tunity of the neighbourhood of the Thames to learn to swim. This practice in an evening, and after sup¬ per, was discommended by several of his attendants j and was supposed to have stopped the bleeding at the nose, from which he had experienced such salutary eft’ects. He could not, however, be prevailed upon to discontinue the practice ; and took likewise great pleasure in walking by the river side in moon-light to hear the sound and echo of the trumpets, by which he was undoubtedly too much exposed to the evening dews. Through impatience to meet the king his fa¬ ther, he rode 60 miles in one day ; and having rested himself during the night, he rode the next day 36 miles to Belvoir Castle, where lie met the king at the time appointed. Dining the heat of the season also he made several other fatiguing journeys, which must undoubtedly have contributed to impair his health","Elizabeth, Richmond","US,ZA",6,"United States,South Africa","North America,Africa"
"At the conclusion of the progress, he gave a grand entertainment to the court from Wednesday till Sun¬ day evening, when the king and queen with the prin¬ cipal nobility attended at supper. Next day he hasten¬ ed to his house at Richmond, where he expected the elector palatine, and began to give orders for his re¬ ception, also to take measures for rewarding his ser¬ vants. To some of these he gave pensions, and pro¬ mised to gratify the rest as soon as possible. From this time, however, his health daily declined. His countenance became more pale, and his body more emaciated : he complained now and then of drowsiness; which frequently made him ask his attendants concern¬ ing the nature and cure of an epidemic fever, probably of the putrid kind, which at that time prevailed in England, and was supposed to have been brought thither from Hungary. He now began frequently to sigh, as is usual for persons afflicted with disorders of that’ kind. The malady increased in the beginning of October, though he used his utmost endeavours to 3 C 2 conceal Henry",Richmond,"HU,ZA",6,"Hungary,South Africa","Europe,Africa"

On the 10th of that month he had two slight fits of an ague, which obliged him to keep his chamber ; and on the 13th his distemper seemed to be augmented by a vio¬ lent diarrhoea, which, however, gave so much relief next day, that he insisted upon being removed from Richmond to St James’s, in order to receive the elec¬ tor palatine. On his arrival there, some of his attend¬ ants began to be alarmed by the signs of sickness which appeared upon him, though he himself made no complaint, and even allowed his physician to go to his own house. The elector arrived on the 16th, and the prince waited upon him at Whitehall $ but his disease had now gained so much ground, that his temper un¬ derwent a very considerable alteration, and he became peevish and discontented with almost every thing: nevertheless he still continued to give orders about what related to the ceremony of his sister’s marriage j and kept company as much as he could with the elector and the count de Nassau, with whose conversation he seemed to be particularly delighted. So great was his activity even at this time, that he played a match at tennis on the 24th of October. At this time he expo¬ sed himself in his shirt, seemingly without any inconve¬ nience; but at night he complained of a greater degree of lassitude than usual, and of a pain in his head. Next day, being Sunday, he attended divine service, and heard two sermons ; after which he dined with his ma¬ jesty, seemingly with a good appetite, but the paleness and ghastly appearance of his countenance were much remarked.

"HERODOTUS, an ancient Greek historian of Halicarnassus in Caria, son of Lyxus and Dryo, was born in the first year of the 74th Olympiad, that is, about 484 B. C. The city of Halicarnassus being at that time under the tyranny of Lygdamis grandson of Artemisia queen of Caria, Herodotus quitted his country and retired to Samos ; from whence he tra¬ velled over Egypt, Greece, Italy, &c. and in his tra¬ vels acquired the knowledge of the history and origin of many nations. He then began to digest the ma¬ terials he had collected into order, and composed that history which has preserved his name among men ever since. He wrote it in the isle of Samos, according to the general opinion.—Lucian informs us, that when Herodotus left Caria to go into Greece, he began to consider with himself What he should do to be for ever known, And make the age to come his own, in the most expeditious way, and with as little trouble as possible. His history, he presumed, would easily procure him fame, and raise his name among the Gre¬ cians in whose favour it was written *, but then he fore¬ saw that it would be very tedious to go through the several cities of Greece, and recite it to each respective city ; to the Athenians, Corinthians, Argives, Lace- darmonians, &c. He thought it most proper there¬ fore to take the opportunity of their assembling all together j and accordingly recited his work at the Olympic games, which rendered him more famous than even those who had obtained the prizes.

"V Such jw 1 HIE [ 463 1 HIE flit -ly Sucli is the opinion that has generally been embraced pH!. both by ancient and modern writers, of the origin and use of hieroglyphics. It has been almost uniformly maintained, that they were invented by the Egyptian priests in order to conceal their wisdom from the know¬ ledge of the vulgar; but the late Bishop Warburton hath, with much ingenuity and learning, endeavoured to show that this account is erroneous",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"He proceeds to show how in process of time the Egyp¬ tian hieroglyphics came to be employed for the vehicle of mystery. They used their hieroglyphics two ways ; the one more simple, by putting the part for the whole, which was the curiologic hieroglyphic ; and the other niore artificial, by putting one thing of resembling qualities for another, called the tropical hieroghjpluc ; thus the moon was sometimes represented by a half circle and sometimes by a cynocephalus. They em¬ ployed their proper hieroglyphics to record openly and Hierogly* plainly their laws, policies, public morals, and history, phics, and all kinds of civil matters: this is evident from theirHier0£rMm"" obelisks, which are full of hieroglyphic characters, de- , mat'sts:* signed to record singular events, memorable actions, * ""V and new inventions ; and also from the celebrated in¬ scription on the temple of Minerva, at Sais, where an infant, an old man, a hawk, a fish, and a river-horse, expressed this moral sentence : “All you who come into the world and go out of it, know this, that the gods hate impudence.” However, the tropical hierogly¬ phics, which were employed to divulge, gradually pro¬ duced symbols which were designed to secrete or con¬ ceal : thus Egypt was sometimes expressed by the cro¬ codile, sometimos by a burning censer with a heart upon it; where the simplicity of the first represen¬ tation and the abstruseness of the latter show, that the one was a tropical hieroglyphic for communica¬ tion, and the other a tropical symbol invented for secrecy",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"Symbols were the true original of animal-worship in Egypt, as Sir John Marsham conjectures, Can. Chroti",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"The symbol of each god was well known and familiar to his worshippers, by means of the popular paintings and engi-avings on their temples and other sacred mo¬ numents ; so that the symbol presenting the idea of the god, and that idea exciting sentiments of religion, it was natural for them, in their addresses to any par¬ ticular god, to turn to his representative mark or sym¬ bol ; especially when we consider farthei', that the Egyptian pi’iests feigned a divine original for hierogly¬ phic characters, in order to increase the veneration of the people for them. These would of course bring on a relative devotion to these symbolic figures, which, when it came to be paid to the living animal, would soon terminate in an ultimate worship",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"Another consequence of the sacredness of the hiero- - glyphic characters was, that it disposed the more su¬ perstitious to engrave them on gems, and wear them as amulets or charms. This magical abuse seems not to have been much earlier than the established worship of the god Serapis, which happened under the Ptole¬ mies, and was first brought to the general knowledge of the world by certain Christian heretics and natives of Egypt, who had mixed a number of Pagan super¬ stitions with their Christianity. These gems, called abraxas, are frequently to be met with in the cabinets of the curious, and are engraven with all kinds of hieroglyphic characters.

In the sum¬ mer of 1732, Mr Highmore visited the continent, in company with Dr Pemberton, Mr Benjamin Robins, and two other friends, chiefly with a view of seeing the gallery of pictures belonging to the elector Palatine at Dusseldorp, collected by Rubens, and supposed the best in Europe. At Antwerp also he had peculiar pleasure in contemplating the works of his favourite master. In their return they visited the principal towns in Holland. In 1734, he made a like excursion, but alone, to Paris, where he received great civilities from his countrymen then there, particularly the duke of Kingston, Dr Hickman (his tutor), Robert Knight, Esq.

"Hill, Aaron, a poet of considerable eminence, the son of a gentleman of Malmesbury-abbey in Wilt¬ shire, was born in 1685. His father’s imprudence having cut off his paternal inheritance, he left Westminster school at 14 years of age j and embarked for Constan¬ tinople, to visit Lord Paget the English ambassador there, who was his distant relation. Lord Paget recei¬ ved him with surprise and pleasure, provided him a tu¬ tor, and sent him to travel : by which opportunity he saw Egypt, Palestine, and a great part of the east; and returning home with his noble patron, visited most of the courts of Europe. About the year 1709, he pub¬ lished his first poem entitled Camillus, in honour of the earl of Peterborough who had been general in Spain j and being the same year made master of Drury-lane theatre, he wrote his first tragedy Elfred, or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master of the opera- house in the Hay-market $ when he wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which met with great success, being the first that Mr Handel set to music after he came to England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a pro¬ jector as well as poet, and in 17*5 obtained a patent for extracting oil from bcech-nuts ; which underta¬ king, whether good or bad, miscarried after engaging three years of his attention. He was also concerned in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia ; from which he never reaped any advantage ; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of Scotland, on a scheme of applying the woods there to ship-building 5 in which he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived in perfect harmony with all the writers of his time, except Mr Pope, with whom he had a short pa¬ per-war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the Dunciad, as one of the competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of Hulness, in the follow¬ ing lines: “ Then Hill essay’d $ scarce vanished out of sight, “ He buoys up instant, and returns to light ; “ He bears no token of the sabler streams, “ And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.’, This, though far the gentlest piece of satire in the whole poem, and conveying at the same time an oblique complimeat, roused Mr Hill to take some notice of it ; which he did by a poem written during his peregrina¬ tion in the north, entitled, “ The Progress of Wit, a Caveat for the use of an eminent writer which he begins with the following eight lines, in which Mr Pope’s too well known disposition is elegantly, yet very severely characterized : ** Tuneful Alexis on the Thames’ fair side, “ The Ladies play-thing, and the Muses pride j “ With merit popular, with wit polite, “ Easy tho’ vain, and elegant tho’ light} “ Desiring and deserving others praise, “ Poorly accepts a Fame he ne’er repays : “ Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves j “ And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves.” The sneakingly approves, in the last couplet, Mr Pope was much affected by; and indeed through their whole controversy afterwards, in which it was generally thought that Mr Hill had much the advantage, Mr Pope seems rather to express his repentance by denying the offence, than to vindicate himself supposing it to have been given. Besides the above poems, Mr Hill, among many others, wrote one, called The northern star, upon the actions of Czar Peter the Great; for which he was several years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from the empress Catharine, according to the Czar’s desire before his death. He likewise alter¬ ed some of Shakespeare’s plays, and translated some of Voltaire’s. His last production was Merope ; which was brought upon the stage in Drury-lane by Mr Gar¬ rick. He died on the 8th of February 1749, as it is said, in the very minute of the earthquake $ and af¬ ter his decease four volumes of his works in prose and verse were published in octavo, and bis dramatic works in two volumes","Westminster, Palestine, Peterborough","US,EG,ES,GE,GB,UK",6,"United States,Egypt,Spain,Georgia,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Africa,Europe,Asia,Europe,N/A"

"country of Hindostan, though he did little else than march over the tracts described by Herodotus. He was informed of the existence of the river Ganges, whicli had not been known to Herodotus 5 and the story of his supposing that he had discovered the source of the Nile, when near the head of the Indus, is well known, as well as his surprise and consternation when he arrived at the mouth of that river, on account of the high tides. Major Rennel is of opinion that both these stories are falsehoods. He thinks it is impossible that Alexander could have been ignorant of the writ¬ ings of Herodotus, who gave an account of the disco¬ veries of Scylax and with regard to the other circum¬ stance he expresses himself as follows. “ The story of Alexander’s surprise at seeing the tides in the Indus, appears to me equally improbable j seeing that the same Herodotus, book iii. speaks very particularly of the tides in the Red sea, and describes them as being not only strong, but ebbing and flowing every day. (That most intelligent and ingenious traveller M. Volney in¬ forms us, that the tide ebbs and flows three feet and a half at Suez). Arrian takes no notice of the tides un¬ til Alexander’s fleet had arrived near the mouth of the river. It is true, the tide of the Indus does not go up so high as in other rivers of equal bulk, and that run on so small a descent j but nevertheless, as the tide is perceptible at 50 or 60 miles above the river’s mouth, we may conclude, that it could hardly escape the no¬ tice of Alexander and his people in their voyage from Pattala to the sea, supposing they had not been apprised of the circumstance. Besides, Arrian’s account of the tide which did so much mischief to the fleet, is descrip¬ tive of the bore, or sudden influx of the tide, in a body of water elevated above the common surface of the seaj such as occurs in the Ganges, &c. Pie says, those ships which lay upon the sand were swept away by the fury of the tide •, while those that stuck in the mud were set afloat again without any damage. To the ge¬ nerality of readers no reason Will appear why the cir¬ cumstances of the ships should be dillerent in the mud and on the sand : the fact is, that the bottoms of chan¬ nels in great rivers are muddy, while their shallows are formed of sand •, and it is the nature of the bore to take the shortest cut up a river, instead of following the windings of the channel; consequently it must cross the sand banks it meets in its way, and will also prove more destructive to whatever it meets with aground than what is afloat.” For an account of the exploits of Alexander in Hindostan, see the article Mace- DON",Suez,EG,6,Egypt,Africa

Nothing now remained to the family of Ta¬ merlane but a small tract of territory round the city of Delhi, now no longer a capital, and exposed to the re¬ peated depredations of invaders, with consequent mas¬ sacres and famines. The last army which could with propriety be termed imperial, was defeated by the Ro- hillas in 1749 > ^7 vvhich their independence was fully established in the eastern parts of the province of Del¬ hi. The Jauts, or Jats, a Hindoo tribe, established themselves in the province of Agra ; the Deccan and Bengal were seized upon by their viceroys, Nizam and Aliverdy. Oude was seized on by Seifdar Jang (fa¬ ther to the late Sujah Dowlah) ; Allahabad by Moham¬ med Kooli. Malwa was divided between the Poonah Mabrattas and several native princes and zemindars : Agimere reverted of course to its ancient lords, the Raj¬ poot princes j and the Mahrattas, in addition to their proper share of Malwa, possessed the greatest part of Guzerat, Berar, and Orissa ; besides their ancient do¬ minions in the Deccan.

"Concerning the number of years which have elapsed since the creation of the world, there have been many disputes.

"that the bare reading must be a sufficient confutation of them to every reasonable person. See the articles China and Egypt.

See Geology. It is therefore reasonable for every person to accept of the Mosaic account of the creation as truth : hut an historian is under an absolute necessity of doing it, be¬ cause, without it, he is quite destitute of any standard or scale by which he might reduce the chronology of different nations to any agreement; and, in short, with¬ out receiving this account as true, it would be in a man¬ ner impossible at this day to write a general history of the world. _ 1.

"For near 200 years after this period, we find no accounts of any other nation than those mentioned in the Gretki Scripture. About 1280 B. C. the Greeks began to make other nations feel the effects of that enterprising and martial spirit for which they were so remarkable, and which they had undoubtedly exercised upon one another long before. Their first enterprise was an in¬ vasion of Colchis (now Mingrelia), for the sake of the golden fleece. Whatever was the nature of this ex¬ pedition, it is probable they succeeded in it; and it is likewise probable, that it was this specimen of the riches of Asia which inclined them so much to Asiatic expeditions ever after. All this time we are totally in the dark about the state of Asia and Africa, except in so far as can be conjectured from Scripture.

"After the death of Solomon, which happened about 975 B. C. the Jewish empire began to decline ; and soon after many powerful states arose in different parts of the world. The disposition of mankind in general seems now to have taken a new turn, not easily ac¬ counted for. In former times, whatever wars might have taken place between neighbouring nations, we have no account of any extensive empire in the whole world, or that any prince undertook to reduce far di¬ stant nations to his subjection. The empire of Egypt indeed is said to have been extended immensely to the east, even before the days of Sesostris. Of this coun¬ try, however, our accounts are so imperfect, that scarce any thing can be concluded from them. But now, as it were all at once, we find almost every nation aiming at universal monarchy, and refusing to set any hounds whatever to its ambition. The first shock given to the Jewish grandeur ivas the division of the kingdom into two, through the imprudence of Reho- boam. This rendered it more easily a prey to Shishak king of Egypt ; who five years after came and pillaged Jerusalem, and all the fortified cities of the kingdom of Judah. The commerce to the East Indies was now discontinued, and consequently the sources of wealth in a great measure stopped ; and this, added to the perpetual wars between the kings of Israel and Judah, contributed to that remarkable and speedy decline which is now so easily to be observed in the Jewish affairs","Of, Jerusalem","EG,IL,TR",6,"Egypt,Israel,Turkey","Africa,Asia,Asia"

"There indeed his cavalry are said to have been only 24,000 ; bat the number of bis chariots is increased to 27,000; which last may not unreasonably be rec¬ koned an exaggeration, and these supernumerary cha¬ riots may have been only cavalry ; but unless we allow Sesostris to be the same with Shishak, it seems impos¬ sible to fix on any other king of Egypt that can be supposed to have undertaken this expedition in the days of Solomon",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"Though the Jews obtained a temporary deliverance from Shishak, they were quicklv after attacked by new enemies. In 941 B. C. one Zerah an Ethiopian in¬ vaded Judaea with an army of a million of infantry and 300 chariots; but was defeated with great slaugh¬ ter by Asa king of Judah, who engaged him with i4 an army of 580,000 men. About this time also we Of the Sy- find the Syrians grown a considerable people, and118*1®"" bitter enemies both to the kings of Israel and Judah ; aiming in fact at the conquest of both nations.

"In 740 B. C. however, the Syrian empire was totally destroyed by Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria ; as was also the kingdom of Samaria by Shalmaneser his suc¬ cessor in 721 B. C. The people were either massacred, or carried into captivity into Media, Persia, and the countries about the Caspian sea. 15 While the nations of the east were thus destroying Of the each other, the foundations of very formidable em- Western pires were laid in the west, which in process of timeIlallons' were to swallow up almost all the eastern ones. In Africa, Carthage was founded by a Tyrian colony, about 869 B. C. according to those who ascribe the highest antiquity to that city ; but, according to others, it was founded only in 769 or 770 B. C. In Europe a very considerable revolution took place about 900 B. C. The Heraclidae, whom we have formerly seen expelled from Greece by Atreus the father of Aga¬ memnon, after several unsuccessful attempts, at last conquered the whole Peloponnesus. From this time the Grecian states became more civilized, and their hi¬ story becomes less obscure. The institution, or rather the revival and continuance, of the Olympic games, in 776 B. C. also greatly facilitated the writing not only of their history, but that of other nations ; for as each Olympiad consisted of four years, the chronology of every important event became indubitably fixed by re¬ ferring it to such and such an Olympiad.

Greece was al¬ so divided into a number of small states, among which the Athenians and Spartans, being the most remark¬ able, were rivals to each other. The former had, about 599 B. C. received an excellent legislation from Solon, and were enriching themselves by navigation and commerce : the latter were become formidable by the martial institutions of Lycurgus j and having con¬ quered Messina, and added its territory to their own, were justly esteemed the most powerful people in Greece","Rome, Solon, Messina","GR,US,IT,ZA",6,"Greece,United States,Italy,South Africa","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa"
"Nebuchadnezzar, a wise and valiant prince, now sat on the throne of Babylon. By him the kingdom of Judaea was totally overthrown in 587 B. C. Three years before this he had taken and razed the city of Tyre, and overrun all the kingdom of Egypt. 'He is even said by Josephus to have conquered Spain, and reigned there nine years, after which he abandoned it to the Carthaginians; hut this seems by no means pro¬ bable. I he extent of the Babylonian empire is not certainly known : but from what is recorded of it we may conclude, that it was not at all inferior even in this respect to any that ever existed ; as the scripture tolls us it was superior in wealth to any of the succeed¬ ing ones. We know that it comprehended Phoenicia, Palestine, Syria, Babylonia, Media, and Persia, and Hot improbably India also ; and from a consideration of this vast extent of territory, and the riches with which every one of these countries abounded, we may form some idea of the wealth and power of this mo¬ narch.

"The Asiatics have in all ages been much inferior to the European nations in valour and military skill. They were now sunk in luxury and effeminacy $ and what was worse, they seem at this period to have been seized with that infatuation and distraction of councils which scarce ever fails to be a forerunner of the destruction of any nation. The Persian ministers persuaded their sovereign to reject the prudent advice that was given Sect. I him, of distressing Alexander by laying waste the conn- £jTii try, and thus forcing him to return for want of provi- History, sions. Nay, they even prevented him from engaging the enemy in the most proper manner, by dividing his forces ; and persuaded him to put Charidemus the A- thenian to death, who had promised with 100,000 men, of whom one-third were mercenaries, to drive the Greeks out of Asia. In short, Alexander met with only two checks in his Persian expedition. The one was from the city of Tyre, which for seven months re¬ sisted his utmost efforts; the other was from Memnon the Rhodian, who had undertaken to invade Macedo¬ nia. The first of these obstacles Alexander at last got over, and treated the governor and inhabitants with the utmost cruelty. The other was scarce felt; for Memnon died after reducing some of the Grecian islands, and Darius had no other general capable of conducting the undertaking. The power of the Per¬ sian empire was totally broken by the victory gained over Darius at Arbela in 331 B. C. and next year a total end was put to it by the murder of the king by Bessus one of his subjects. 55 The ambition of Alexander was not to be satisfied H*8 con- with the possession of the kingdom of Persia, or indeed^|, °ft of any other on earth. Nothing less than the total ^5 subjection of the word itself seemed sufficient to him ; and therefore he was now prompted to invade every country of which he could only learn the name, whe¬ ther it had belonged to the Persians or not. In con¬ sequence of this disposition, he invaded and reduced Hy rcania, Bactria, Sogdia, and all that vast tract of country now called Bukharia. At last, having entered India, he reduced all the nations to the river Hypha- sis, one of the branches of the Indus. But when he would have proceeded farther, and extended his con¬ quests quite to the eastern extremities of Asia, his troops positively refused to follow him farther, and he was constrained to return. In 323 B. C. this mighty conqueror died of a fever ; without having time to settle the affairs of his vast extended empire, or even to name his successor. . ^ While the Grecian empire thus suddenly sprung np^81^ in the east, the rival states of Rome and Carthage iveremans making considerable advances in the west. The Ro¬ mans were establishing their empire on the most solid foundations ; to which their particular situation natu¬ rally contributed. Being originally little better than a parcel of lawless banditti, they were despised and hated by the neighbouring states. This soon produced wars; in which, at first from accidental circumstances, and af¬ terwards from their superior valour and conduct, the Romans proved almost constantly victorious. The jea¬ lousies which prevailed among the Italian states, and their ignorance of their true interest, prevented them from combining against that aspiring nation, and crush¬ ing it in its infancy, which they might easily have done ; while in the mean time the Romans being kept in a state of continual warfare, became at last such ex¬ pert soldiers, that no other state on earth could resist them. During the time of their kings they had made a very considerable figure among the Italian nations; but after their expulsion, and the commencement ot the republic, their conquests became much more rapid and extensive.

"Gar- The Carthaginians in the mean time continued to ians, enrich themselves by commerce $ but, being less con- Si- versant in military affairs, were by no means equal to the Romans in power, though they excelled them in wealth. A new state, however, makes its appearance during this period, which may be said to have taught the Carthaginians the art of war, and, by bringing them into the neighbourhood of the Romans, proved the first source of contention between these two power¬ ful nations. This was the island of Sicily. At what time people were first settled on it, is not now to be ascertained. The first inhabitants we read of were called Sicani, Siculi, Leestrigones, &c. but of these we know little or nothing. In the second year of the 17th Olympiad, or 710 B. C. some Greek colonies are said to have arrived on the island, and in a short time founded several cities, of which Syracuse was the chief. The Syracusans at last subdued the original inhabitants: though it doth not appear that the lat¬ ter were ever well affected to their government, and therefore were on all occasions ready to revolt. The first considerable prince, or (as he is called by the Greeks) tyrant of Syracuse, was Gelon, who obtained the sovereignty about the year 483 B. C. At what time the Carthaginians first carried their arms into Si¬ cily is not certainly known j only we are assured, that Vql. X. Part II. f 513 they possessed some part of the island as early as 505 B. C. lor in the time of the first consuls, the Ro¬ mans and Carthaginians entered into a treaty chiefly in regard to matters of navigation and commerce j by which it was stipulated, that the Romans who should touch at Sardinia, or that part of Sicily which belong¬ ed to Carthage, should be received there in the same manner as the Carthaginians themselves. Whence it appears, that the dominion of Carthage already extend¬ ed over Sardinia and part of Sicily : but in 28 years after, they had been totally driven out by Gelon : which probably was the first exploit performed by him","Syracuse, Syracuse, Carthage, Carthage","US,TN,GR",6,"United States,Tunisia,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"
"This appears from his speech to the Athenian and Spartan ambassadors who desired his assistance against the forces of Xerxes king of Persia.

The first remarkable events took place in the Macedonian empire.—Alexander, as already observed, had not distinctly named any successor 5 but he had left behind him a victorious, and, we may say, invin¬ cible army, commanded by most expert officers, all of them ambitious of supreme authority. It is not to be supposed that peace could long be preserved in such a situation.

"Hamilcar perceiving that there was now no alter¬ native, but that in a short time either Carthage must conquer Rome, or Rome would conquer Carthage, bethought himself of a method by which his country might become equal to that haughty republic. This was by reducing all Spain, in which the Carthaginians had already considerable possessions, and from the mines of which they drew great advantages. He had, therefore, no sooner finished the war with the mercenaries, which succeeded that with the Romans, than he set about the conquest of Spain. This, how¬ ever, he did not live to accomplish, though he made great progress in it. His son Asdrubal continued the war with success j till at last the Romans, jealous of O R Y. Sect, his progress, persuaded him to enter into a treaty with civil ( them, by which he engaged himself to make the river Histor ' Iberus the boundary of his conquests.

"The transactions of the second Punic war are perhaps the most remarkable which the history of the world can afford. Certain it is, that nothing can show more clearly the slight foundations upon which the greatest empires are built. We now see the Romans, the na¬ tion most remarkable for their military skill in the whole world, and who, for more than 500 years, had been constantly victorious, unable to resist the efforts of one single man. At the same time we see this man, though evidently the first general in the world, lost solely for want of a slight support. In former times, the republic of Carthage supplied her generals in Si¬ cily with hundreds of thousands, though their enter¬ prises were almost constantly unsuccessful j but now Hannibal, the conqueror of Italy, was obliged to abandon his design, merely for want of 20 or 30,000 men. That degeneracy and infatuation, which never fails to overwhelm a falling nation, or rather which is the cause of its fall, had now infected the counsels of Carthage, and the supplies were denied. Neither was Carthage the only infatuated nation at this time.—» Hannibal, whose prudence never forsook him either in prosperity or adversity, in the height of his good fortune had concluded an alliance with Philip king of Macedon.

"This revolution, however, was of no long continu¬ ance. In 167 B. C. Mattathias restored the true worship in most of the cities of Judea ; and in 168 the temple was purified, and the worship there restored by Judas Maccabseus. This was followed by along series of wars between the Syrians and Jews, in which the latter were almost always victorious ; and before these wars were finished, the destruction of Carthage happen¬ ed, which puts an end to the sixth general period for¬ merly mentioned. 32 7. The beginning of the seventh period presents us Seventh pe- with a view of the ruins of the Greek empire in the declining states of Syria and Egypt j both of them of^ much circumscribed in bounds. The empire of Syria world, at first comprehended all Asia to the river Indus, and beyond it j but in 312 B. C. most of the Indian pro¬ vinces were by Seleucus ceded to one Sandrocottus, or Androcottus, a native, who in return gave him 500 elephants. Of the empire of Sandrocottus we know nothing farther than that he subdued all the countries between the Indus and the Ganges ; so that from this time we may reckon the greatest part of India inde¬ pendent on the Syro-Macedonian princes. In 250 B. C. however, the empire sustained a much greater loss by the revolt of the Parthians and Bactrians from Antiochus Theus. The former could not be subdued j and as they held in subjection to them the vast tract which now goes under the name of Persia, we must look upon their defection as an irreparable loss. Whe¬ ther any part of their country was afterwards recover¬ ed by the kings of Egypt or Syria is not very certain ; nor is it of much consequence, since we are assured that in the beginning of the seventh period, i. e. 146 B. C. the Greek empires of Syria and Egypt were reduced by the loss of India, Persia, Armenia, Pon- tus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Pergamus, &c. The ge¬ neral state of the world in 146 B. C. therefore was as follows. In Asia were the empires of India, Par- thia, and Syria, with the lesser states of Armenia, Pontus, &c. above mentioned j to which we must add that of Arabia, which during the sixth period had grown into some consequence, and had maintained its independency from the days of Ishmael the son of Abraham. In Africa were the kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia; the Carthaginian territories now sub¬ ject to the Romans ; and the kingdoms of Numidia, Mauritania, and Getulia, ready to be swallowed up by the same ambitious and insatiable power, now that Carthage was destroyed, which served as a barrier a- gainst it. To the south lay some unknown and bar¬ barous nations, secure by reason of their situation and insignificance, rather than their strength, or distance from Rome. In Europe we find none to oppose the progress of the Roman arms, except the Gauls, Ger- 3 T 2 mans, 5i6 Civil History","Carthage, Asia, Of, Carthage, Rome, Roman","SY,EG,IN,AM,TN,GR,ET,MR,PH,TR,US,RO",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,Egypt,India,Armenia,Tunisia,Greece,Ethiopia,Mauritania,Philippines,Turkey,United States,Romania","Asia,Africa,Asia,Asia,Africa,Europe,Africa,Africa,Asia,Asia,North America,Europe"
In Africa the crimes of Jugurtha soon gave this am¬ bitious republic an opportunity of conquering the king¬ doms of Numidia and Mauritania : and indeed this is almost the only war in which we find the Romans en¬ gaged where their pretensions had the least colour of justice ; though in no case whatever could a nation show more degeneracy than the Romans did on this occasion,,MR,6,Mauritania,Africa

"Thus the Romans became masters of all the eastern parts ef the world, from the Mediterranean sea to the borders of Parthia. In the west, however, the Gauls were still at liberty, and the Spanish nations bore the Roman yoke with great impatience. The Gauls infest¬ ed the territories of the republic by their frequent in¬ cursions, which were sometimes very terrible j and though several attempts had been made to subdue them, they always proved insufficient till the time of Julius Ccesar. By him they were totally reduced, from the ri¬ ver Rhine to the Pyrentean mountains, and many of their nations almost exterminated. He carried his arms also into Germany and the southern parts of Bri¬ tain ; but in neither of these parts did he make any permanent conquests. The civil wars between him and Pompey gave him an opportunity of seizing on the kingdom of Mauritania and those parts of Numi¬ dia which had been allowed to retain their liberty",Roman,"DE,MR,RO,ES",6,"Germany,Mauritania,Romania,Spain","Europe,Africa,Europe,Europe"
"The kingdom of Egypt alone remained, and to this nothing belonged except the country properly so call¬ ed. Cyrenaica was bequeathed by will to the Romans about 58 B. C. $ and about the same time the island of Cyprus was seized by them without any pretence, ex¬ cept a desire of possessing the treasure ot the king.— The kingdom of Egypt continued for some time longer at liberty j which in some measure must be ascribed to the internal dissensions of the republic, but more especially to the amours of Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony, with the famous Cleopatra queen of Egypt. The battle of Actium, however, deter¬ mined the fate of Antony, Cleopatra, and Egypt it¬ self ; which last was reduced to a Roman province about 9 B. C. 34 While the Romans thus employed all means to re-Origin am duce the world to their obedience, they were ma- progressc king one another feel the same miseries at home which1 they inflicted upon other Rations abroad.

Once they gave them a most terrible and shame¬ ful defeat, wherein 30,000 Romans fled before 4000 Numantines. Twenty thousand were killed in the battle, and the remaining ten thousand so shut up, that there was no possibility of escaping.

"Thus was the Roman empire divided into four parts 3 which by all historians is said to have been productive of the greatest mischiefs. As each of these four sovereigns would have as many officers both civil and military, and the same number of forces that had been maintained by the state when governed only by one emperor, the people were not able to pay the sums necessary for supporting them. Hence the taxes and imposts were increased beyond measure, the inhabitants in several provinces reduced to beggary, the laud left untilled for want of hands, &c. An end was put to these evils when the empire was again united under Constantine the Great j but in 330 a mortal blow was given it, by removing the imperial seat to Byzantium, now Constantinople, and making it equal to Rome","Roman, Constantine, Rome","RO,DZ,US",6,"Romania,Algeria,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"

"Among the western nations, revolutions, as might naturally be expected from the character of the people, succeeded one another with rapidity. The Heruli un¬ der Odoacer were driven out by the Goths under Theodoric. The Goths were expelled by the Romans; and, while the two parties were contending, both were attacked by the Franks, who carried off an immense booty. The Romans were in their turn expelled by the Goths : the Franks again invaded Italy, and made themselves masters of the province of Venetia ; but at last the superior fortune of the emperor of Constantino¬ ple prevailed, and the Goths were finally subdued in 553. Narses, the conqueror of the Goths, governed Italy as a province of the eastern empire till the year 568, when Longinus his successor made considerable alterations. The Italian provinces had ever since the time of Constantine the Great been governed by consu- lares, correctores, and presides ; no alteration having been made either by the Roman emperors, or the Go¬ thic kings. But Longinus, being invested with abso¬ lute power by Justinian, suppressed those magistrates ; and, instead of them, placed in each city of note a go¬ vernor, whom he distinguished with the title of duke","Constantine, Roman","IT,DZ,RO",6,"Italy,Algeria,Romania","Europe,Africa,Europe"

""" While the barbarians of the east were thus grasping at the empire of the whole world, great disturbances happened among the no less barbarous nations of the west. Superstition seems to have been the ruling mo¬ tive in both cases. The Saracens and Turks conquer¬ ed for the glory of God, or of his apostle Mahomet and his successors j the western nations professed an equal regard for the divine glory, but which was only to be perceived in the respect they paid to the pope and clergy. Ever since the establishment of Christi¬ anity by Constantine, the bishops of Rome had been gradually extending their power j and attempting not only to render themselves independent, hut even to as¬ sume an authority over the emperors themselves. The destruction of the empire was so far from weakening their power, that it afforded them opportunities of greatly extending it, and becoming judges of the sovereigns of Italy themselves, whose barbarity and ignorance prompted them to submit to their decisions. All this time, however, they themselves had been in subjec¬ tion to the emperors of Constantinople j but on the decline of that empire, they found means to get themselves exempted from this subjection. The prin¬ cipal authority in the city of Rome was then engross¬ ed by the bishop j though of right it belonged to the duke appointed by the exarch of Ravenna. But though they had now little to fear from the eastern empe¬ rors, they were in great danger from the ambition of the Lombards, who aimed at the conquest of all Italy","Constantine, Rome, Rome, Ravenna","IT,US,DZ",6,"Italy,United States,Algeria","Europe,North America,Africa"
"xh which they called the Ho/y Land, to be an invaluable acquisition, for which no sum of money could be an equivalent ; and both took the most unjustifiable me¬ thods to accomplish their desires. The superstition of Omar the second caliph had prompted him to invade this country, part of the territories of the Greek empe¬ ror, who was doing him no hurt; and now when it had been so long under the subjection of the Mahometans, a similar superstition prompted the pope to send an army for the recovery of it. The crusaders accordingly poured forth in multitudes, like those with which the kings of Persia formerly invaded Greece ; and their fate w'as pretty similar. Their impetuous valour at first, indeed, carried every thing before them ; they reco¬ vered all Palestine, Phoenicia, and part of Syria, from the infidels ; but their want of conduct soon lost what their valour had obtained, and very few of that vast multitude which had left Europe ever returned to their native countries. A second, a third, and several other crusades, were preached, and were attended with a like success in both respects : vast numbers took the cross, and repaired to the Holy Land ; which they polluted with the most abominable massacres and treacheries, and from which very few of them returned. In the third crusade Richard I. of England was embarked, who seems to have been the best general that ever went into the east: but even his valour and skill were not sufficient to repair the faults of his companions; and he was obliged to return even after he had entirely de¬ feated his antagonists, and was within sight of Jeru¬ salem","Ho, Palestine","GR,SY,GH,US",6,"Greece,Syrian Arab Republic,Ghana,United States","Europe,Asia,Africa,North America"

"Constantine the Great, in order to prevent civil com- • motions, and to fix his authority on a stable and solid foundation, made several changes not only in the laws of the empire, but also in the form of the Roman go¬ vernment. And as there were many important reasons which induced him to suit the administration of the church to these changes in the civil constitution,' this necessarily introduced among the bishops new degrees of eminence and rank. The four bishops, of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, were distin¬ guished by a certain degree of pre-eminence over the rest. These four prelates answered to the four prae¬ torian prefects created by Constantine *, and it is pos¬ sible, that even in this century they were distinguished by the Jewish title of patriarchs. After these followed the exarchs, who had the inspection of several pro¬ vinces, and answered to the appointment of certain ci¬ vil officers who bore the same title. In a lower class were the metropolitans, who had only the government of one province j under whom were the archbishops, whose inspection was confined to certain districts. In this gradation the bishops brought up the rear ; but the sphere of their authority was not in all places equally extensive ; being in some considerably ample, and in others confined within narrow limits. To these va¬ rious ecclesiastical orders we might add that of the chorepiscopi, or superintendents of the country churches j but this last order was in most places suppressed by the bishops, with a design to extend their own autho¬ rity, and enlarge the sphere of their power and juris¬ diction. The administration of the church itself was divided by Constantine into an external and internalm- spection. The latter, which was committed to bishops and councils, related to religious controversies, the O R Y","Constantine, Roman, Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantine, Constantine","DZ,US,RO",6,"Algeria,United States,Romania","Africa,North America,Europe"
"self. This comprehended all those things which re-' 'r J lated to the outward state and discipline of the church j it likewise extended to all contests that should arise be¬ tween the ministers of the church, superior as well as inferior, concerning their possessions, their reputation, their rights and privileges, their ofiences against the laws, &c. but no controversies that related to matters purely spiritual were cognizable by this external in¬ spection. In consequence ol this artful division ol the ecclesiastical government, Constantine and his succes¬ sors called councils, presided in them, appointed the judges of religious controversies, terminated the difler- ences which arose between the bishops and the people, fixed the limits of the ecclesiastical provinces, took cognizance of the civil causes that subsisted between the ministers of the church, and punished the crimes committed against the laws by the ordinary judges ap¬ pointed for that purpose ; giving over all causes purely ecclesiastical to the bishops and councils. But this ia- mous division of the administration of the clmrch was never explained with sufficient accuracy j so that both in the fourth and fifth centuries, there are Irequent in¬ stances of the emperors determining matters purely ec¬ clesiastical, and likewise of bishops and councils deter¬ mining matters which related merely to the external form and government of the church. j0 After the time of Constantine many additions werescandahm made by the emperors and others to the wealth and lives ot the honours of the clergy ; and these additions were fo!-®161^- lowed by a proportional increase of their vices and luxury, particularly among those who lived in great and opulent cities. The bishops, on the one hand, con¬ tended with each other in the most scandalous manner concerning the extent of their respective jurisdictions 5 while, on the other, they trampled on the rights of the people, violated the privileges of the inferior ministers, and imitated in their conduct and in their manner oi living the arrogance, voluptuousness, and luxury ot magistrates and princes. This pernicious example was soon followed by the several ecclesiastical orders. The presbyters, in many places, assumed an equality with the bishops in point of rank and authority. Many complaints are also made by the authors of this cen¬ tury about the vanity and effeminacy of the deacons","Constantine, Constantine",DZ,6,Algeria,Africa
"£ csia- atilliority. The same council confirmed also, by a so- cal lemn act, the bishop of Constantinople in the spiritual 1 too- government of those provinces over which he had u v usurped the jurisdiction. Leo the Great, bishop of Kome, opposed with vehemence the passing of these laws j and his opposition was seconded by that of se¬ veral other prelates. But their elforts were vain, as the emperors threw in their weight into the balance, and thus supported the decisions of the Grecian bi¬ shops. In consequence, then, of the decisions of this famous council, the bishop of Constantinople began to contend obstinately for the supremacy with the Ho¬ man pontiff, and to crush the bishops of Antioch and Alexandria. About the same time, Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem, attempted to withdraw himself and his church from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Caesarea, and aspired after a place among the first prelates of the Christian world. The high degree of veneration and esteem in which the church of Jerusalem was held among all other Christian societies (on account of its rank among the apostolical churches, and its title to the appellation of mother-church, as having succeeded the first Christian assembly formed by the apostles), was extremely favourable to the ambition of Juvenal, and rendered bis project much more practicable than it would otherwise have been. Encouraged by this, and likewise by the protection of Theodosius the younger, this aspiring prelate not only assumed the dignity of patriarcli of all Palestine, a rank which rendered him independent-of all spiritual authority j but also invad¬ ed the rights of the bishop of Antioch, and usurped his jurisdiction over the provinces of Phoenicia and Arabia","Ho, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Palestine, Antioch","US,IL,GH",6,"United States,Israel,Ghana","North America,Asia,Africa"
"In 588, John, bishop of Constantinople, surnamed the Faster, either by his own authority or that of the emperor Mauritius, summoned a council at Constanti- noole to acquire into an accusation brought against Gregory, bishop of Antioch; and upon this occasion as¬ sumed the title of oecumenical ox universal bishop. This title had been formerly enjoyed by the bishops of Con¬ stantinople without any offence: but now, Gregory the Great, at that time bishop of Rome, suspecting that John was aiming at the supremacy over all the churches, opposed his claim with the greatest vigour","Antioch, Rome","US,MU",6,"United States,Mauritius","North America,Africa"
"Hence, among other unhappy circumstances, arose that monstrous and pernicious opinion, that such per¬ sons as were excluded from the communion of the church by the pontiff himself, or any of the bishops, thus forfeited, not only their civil rights and advan¬ tages as citizens, but even the common claims and privileges of humanity. This horrid opinion, which was a fatal source of wars, massacres, and rebellions without number, and which contributed more than any thing else to confirm and augment the papal au¬ thority, was borrowed by the clergy from the Pagan superstitions.-—Though excommunication, from the time of Constantine the Great, was in every part of the Christian world attended with many disagreeable effects; yet its highest terrors were confined to Eu¬ rope, where its aspect was truly formidable and hide¬ ous. It acquired also, in the eighth century, new ac¬ cessions of teri'or j so that from that period the excom¬ munication practised in Europe difiered entirely from that which was in use in other parts of Christendom",Constantine,DZ,6,Algeria,Africa
"But the generality of writers in his kind content them¬ selves with taking their accounts from hearsays, or transcribing them from others, without duly weighing the evidence on which they are founded, or giving themselves the trouble of a strict inquiry. Few will use the diligence necessary to inform themselves of the certainty of what they undertake to relate. And as the want of this greatly abates the pleasure of reading such writers, while persons read with diffidence; so nothing more recommends an historian than such in¬ dustry. Thus we are informed of Thucydides, that when he wrote his history of the Peloponnesian war, he did not satisfy himself with the best accounts he could get from his countrymen the Athenians, fearing they might be partial in their own cause; but spared no expence to inform himself how the same facts were re¬ lated by their enemies the Lacedmmonians ; that, by comparing the relations of both parties, he might better judge of the truth. And Polybius took greater pains than he, in order to write his history of the Roman af¬ fairs ; for he travelled into Africa, Spain, and Gaul, and other parts of the world, that by viewing the se¬ veral scenes of action, and informing himself from the inhabitants, he might come at a greater certainty of the facts, and represent them in a juster light. But as an historian ought not to assert what he knows to be false ; so he should likewise be cautious in relating things which are doubtful, and acquaint his readers with the evidence he goes upon in such facts, from whence they may be able to judge how far it is proper to credit them. So Herodotus tells us what things he saw himself in his travels, and what he heard from the information of the Egyptian priests and others with whom he conversed.

This was very suitable to Mr -v-— Hobbes’s inclinations, who discharged that trust with great fidelity and diligence. In 1634, he republished his translation of Thucydides, and prefixed to it a de¬ dication to tiiat young nobleman, in which he gives a great character of his father, and represents in the strongest terms the obligations he was under to that illustrious family. The same year he accompanied his noble pupil to Paris, where he applied his vacant hours to the study of natural philosophy, and more especially to the perfect understanding of mechanism, and the causes of animal motion.

Afterwards, foreseeing the civil wars, he went to seek a retreat at Paris ; where, by the good offices of his friend Father Mersenne, he became known to the famous Renatus des Cartes, and afterwards held a correspondence with him upon several mathematical subjects, as appears from the letters of Mr Hobbes pub¬ lished in the works of Des Cartes. But when this philosopher printed afterwards his Meditations, where¬ in he attempted to establish points of the highest conse¬ quence from innate ideas, Mr Hobbes took the liberty of dissenting from him; as did also the French king’s mathematical professor, the illustrious Peter Gassendi, with whom Mr Hobbes contracted a very close friend¬ ship, which was not interrupted till the death of the former. In 1642, Mr Hobbes printed a few copies of his famous hook De Give, which, in proportion as it became known, raised him many adversaries, who charged him with instilling principles which had a dangerous tendency. Among many illustrious persons who, upon shipwreck of the royal cause, retired to France for safety, was Sir Charles Cavendish, brother to the duke of Newcastle ; and this gentleman, being skilled in every branch of the mathematics, proved a constant friend and patron to Mr Hobbes $ who, by embarking in 1645 in a controversy about squaring the circle, was grown so famous for it, that in 1647 was recommended to instruct Charles prince of Wales, afterwards King Charles II. in mathematical learning","Paris, Paris, Pisa, Paris, Newcastle","US,IT,FR,ZA",6,"United States,Italy,France,South Africa","North America,Europe,Europe,Africa"

They now met with favourable winds, blowing generally in very strong gales from the north-west, west, and south-west.

"Their first landing was at the head of a small cove country, named Shell-covey near the entrance of the harbour on the north side. Proceeding in this direction, they ar¬ rived with great labour at a large lake, surrounded on all sides with bog and marshy ground to a considerable extent, and in which they frequently plunged up to the waist. Here they observed that bird so rare in other parts of the world, viz. a black swan. On being fired at, it rose, and shewed that its wings were edged with white, the bill being tinged red. They spent three days in a very laborious manner in passing the marshes and swamps which lie in the neighbourhood of the har¬ bour : and here they had an opportunity of observing, that all the small streams which descend into Port Jack- son proceed from swamps, occasioned by the stagnation of the water in the low grounds as it rises from the springs. On leaving these low grounds, they found them succeeded by a rocky and barren country $ the hills covered with various flowering shrubs, though fre¬ quently inaccessible by reason of various natural obsta¬ cles. At about 15 miles distance from the sea, the go¬ vernor had a fine view of the internal parts of the coun¬ try, which were mountainous. To the most northerly chain of these he gave the name of Carmarthen, and to the most southerly that of Lansdown Hills ; and to one which lay between these he gave the name of Richmond Hill. It was conjectured, that a large river must rise from these mountains j but there was now a necessity for returning. On the 22d, however, another expedition was undertaken.

Here they found a good country 5 but in a short time arrived at a close thicket through which they found it impossible to make their way, so that they were obliged to return. Next day, by keeping close to the banks of a small creek, they made a shift to pass that obstacle, and continued their course for three days to the westward. The coun¬ try was now extremely fine, either entirely level or ris¬ ing in small hills j the soil excellent, but stony in a few places.

"The settlers about Port Jackson found enough for the common purposes of life; but Captain Tench in¬ forms us, that when he left the country, towards the end of 1788, there had been no discovery of a stream large enough to turn a mill. Since that time, how¬ ever, Governor Phillip has been more successful} as we are informed by a letter of his to Lord Sydney, of date February 13. 1790 : In this letter he relates, that soon after the ships sailed in Nov. 1788, he again made an excursion to Botany Bay, where he staid five days ; but the researches he made there tended only to confirm him in the opinion he already entertained that the country round it was by no means an eligible situation for a colony. After having visited Broken Bay several times with boats, a river was found, which has since been traced, and all those branches explored, which afforded any depth of water. This river has obtained the name of Hawkcsbury, is from 300 to 800 feet wide, and seems navigable for the largest merchant ships as far up as Richmond hill, at which it becomes very shallow, and divides into two branches } on which account the governor calls Richmond hill the head of the river. As after very heavy rains, however, the water sometimes arises 30 feet above its level, it would not be safe for ships to go up so far} but 15 or 20 miles below it they would lie in fresh water, and be perfectly safe","Bay, Richmond, Richmond","ZA,PH",6,"South Africa,Philippines","Africa,Asia"

There is a flat of six or seven miles between Richmond hill and a break in the mountains which separates Lansdown and Carmarthen kills ; in which flat the governor sup¬ poses that the Hawkesbury continues its course; though the river could not be seen on account of the timber with which the ground is everywhere covered where the soil is good. Six miles to the southward of Port Jackson is a small river } and 20 to the westward is one more considerable, which probably empties itself into the Hawkesbury.

"A man of Magnesia, whose name was Menalippus, went to settle at Cumse, where he married the daugh¬ ter of a citizen called Homyres, and had by her a daughter called Critheis. The father and mother dy¬ ing, the young woman was left under the tuition of Cleonax her father’s friend, and sufl'ering herself to be deluded, was got with child. The guardian, though his care had not prevented the misfortune, was how¬ ever willing to conceal it; and therefore sent Critheis to Smyrna, which was then building, 18 years after the founding of Cumae, and about 168 after the taking of Troy. Critheis being near her time, went one day to a festival which the town of Smyrna was celebra¬ ting on the banks of the river Meles; where her pains coming upon her, she was delivered of Homer, whom she called Melesigenes, because he was born on the banks H O M [ 581 ] H O M cr. banks of that river. Having nothing to maintain her, —' she was forced to spin, and a man of Smyrna called Phernias, who taught literature and music, having of¬ ten seen Critheis, who lodged near him, and being pleased with her housewifery, took her into his house to spin the wool he received from his scholars for their schooling. Here she behaved herself so modestly and discreetly, that Phemius married her ; and adopted her son, in whom he discovered a wonderful genius, and the best natural disposition in the world. After the death of Phemius and Critheis, Homer succeeded to his father-in-law’s fortune and school ; and was admi¬ red, not only by the inhabitants of Smyrna, but by strangers, who resorted from all parts to that place of trade. A shipmaster called Menles, who was a man of learning and a lover of poetry, was so taken with Ho¬ mer, that he persuaded him to leave his school, and to travel with him. Homer, who had then begun his poem of the Iliad, and thought it of great consequence to see the places he should have occasion to treat of, em¬ braced the opportunity. He embaiked with Mentes, and during their several voyages never failed carefully to note down all that he thought worth observing. He travelled into Egypt; from whence he brought into Greece the names of their gods, the chief ceremonies of their worship, and a more improved knowledge in the arts than what prevailed in his own country. He visited Africa and Spain ; in his return from whence he touched at Ithaca, where he was much troubled with a rheum falling upon his eyes. Mentes being in haste to take a turn to Leucadia his native country, left Homer well recommended to Mentor, one of the chief men of the island of Ithaca, who took all possible care of him. There Homer was informed of many things relating to Ulysses, which he afterwards made use of in composing his Odyssey. Mentes returning to Ithaca, found Homer cured. They embarked toge¬ ther j and after much time spent in visiting the coasts of Peloponnesus and the islands, they arrived at Colo¬ phon, where Homer was again troubled with the de- fluxion upon his eyes, which proved so violent, that he is said to have lost his sight. This misfortune made him resolve to return to Smyrna, where he finished his Iliad. Some time after, the ill posture of his affairs obliged him to go to Cumae, where he hoped to have found some relief. Here his poems were highly ap¬ plauded : but when he proposed to immortalize their town, if they would allow him a salary, he was answer¬ ed, that “ there would be no end of maintaining all the or blind men and hence got the name of Homer. He afterwards wandered through several places, and stopped at Chios, where he married, and composed his Odyssey. Some time after, having add¬ ed many verses to his poems in praise of the cities of Greece, especially of Athens and Argos, he went to Samos, wdiere he spent the winter, singing at the houses of the great men, with a train of boys after him. From Samos he went to lo, one of the Sporades, with a de¬ sign to continue his voyage to Athens ; but landing by the way at Chios, he fell sick, died, and was buried on the sea shore","Smyrna, Troy, Smyrna, Smyrna, Smyrna, Ho, Ithaca, Mentor, Ithaca, Ithaca, Smyrna, Athens, Athens","US,GR,EG,ES,GH",6,"United States,Greece,Egypt,Spain,Ghana","North America,Europe,Africa,Europe,Africa"

"The hymn to Ceres appears to be entire, excepting a few lines towards the close : and it is surely remarkable, that a Greek poem, attributed to Homer, which had been lost for ages, should be at length discovered in Muscovy, the rudest and most unclassical country in Europe. M. Matthtei, exulting in an acquisition so unexpected, and at the same time so valuable, commu¬ nicated it, with singular disinterestedness, to his learn¬ ed friend M. Ruhnkenius, with whose talents and ex¬ traordinary erudition he was well acquainted, that this gentleman might present it to the world without those delays which would probably have retarded the publica¬ tion of it at Moscow. He was rather induced to em¬ ploy M. Ruhnkenius in the publication of this curious and beautiful remnant of antiquity, because he knew that this gentleman had been particularly engaged in the study of the hymns of Homer, in order to give the public a complete edition of them. The hymn to Ce¬ res, and the fragment of the hymn to Bacchus, were printed in 1780 at Leyden, under the care of M. Ruhn- kenhis, who has added some very valuable notes and observations on the hymn to Ceres, which tend to illus¬ trate its beauties, and to throw a light on some of its obscurities. The learned editor observes, that nothing was more distant from his expectations than the disco¬ very of this hymn to Ceres. He knew indeed that a poem bearing that title, and ascribed to Homer, existed in the second century ; but as it had long been consi¬ dered as irretrievably lost, he had formed no hopes of ever seeing it rescued from the obscurity to which it had been consigned. He acknowledges, that he has many doubts with respect to the high and illustrious origin ascribed to this hymn : but as no positive external evi¬ dence can be produced to determine the point, he chooses to rest his argument on what appears to him the more certain ground of internal proof •, and observes, that though the poem be exquisitely beautiful, yet that it is evidently deficient in some of Homer’s more strik¬ ing and predominant characteristics. It wants his ener¬ gy and spirit; that vigour, that inspiration, which ani¬ mate and give an irresistible power, as well as an en¬ chanting beauty, to the poems of that sublime and ini¬ mitable bard. This opinion, as we have already seen, hath been given by other critics of all the hymns of 3 Homer. But though M. Ruhnkenius is not inclined to attribute to Homer the hymn to Ceres, he yet ac¬ knowledges, that the structure of its language is found- Hwmcidt","Ceres, Moscow, Ceres, Ceres, Ceres","ZA,US,GR",6,"South Africa,United States,Greece","Africa,North America,Europe"

In the reign of Edward II. they complained to parlia¬ ment, that by foreigners buying up the horns in Eng¬ land, they were in danger of being ruined, and this business lost to the nation. For this reason was made the statute 6 Edw. IV. by which the sale of horns to foreigners (except such as the said horners refused) was prohibited ; and the wardens had power granted them to search all the markets in London, and twenty-four miles round, and to inspect Sturbridge and Ely fairs, to prevent such practices, and to purchase horns at sta¬ ted prices. But on plausible pretences this law was re¬ pealed in the reign of James I. and thereupon the old evil revived. The horners again applied to parlia¬ ment, and King Edward’s statute was renewed (except¬ ing as to the inspection of the fairs), and still remains in force. The importation of unwrought horns into this country is also prohibited. In 1750, there were exported to Holland 514,500 lantern leaves, besides powder flasks. There was formerly a duty of 20 shil¬ lings a thousand, under which in 1682 were exported 76,650 ; but in the reign of George I. this duty was taken off, and these and all other manufactures made of horns may be exported free.

They said that he was the son of Osiris and of Isis j that Typhon, after killing his brother Osiris, took possession of the kingdom ; that Horus, leaguing himself with Isis, avenged the death of his fa¬ ther, expelled the tyrant from his throne without de¬ priving him of life, and reigned gloriously in Egypt",,EG,6,Egypt,Africa
"A person who has travelled ever so little in Egypt ea¬ sily discovers natural phenomena hid under the veil of fable. In the spring, the wind khamsin frequently makes great ravages there. It raises whirlwinds of burning sand, which suffocate travellers, darken the air, and cover the face of the sun in such a manner as to leave the earth in perfect obscurity. Here is the death of Osiris and the reign of Typhon. These hur¬ ricanes break out usually in the months of February, March, and April. When the sun approaches the sign of the lion, he changes the state of the atmosphere, disperses these tempests, and restores the northerly winds, which drive before them the malignant vapours, and preserve in Egypt coolness and salubrity under a burning sky. This is the triumph of Horus over Ty¬ phon, and his glorious reign. As the natural philoso¬ phers acknowledge the influence of the moon over the state of the atmosphere, they united her with this god, to drive the usurper from the throne. The priests con¬ sidering Osiris as the father of time, might bestow the name of his son on Horus, who reigned three months in H rr* the year. This, according to Mr Savary-f, is the na- tpf, tural explication of this allegory. And all enlightened 4 men, he thinks, must have understood this language, which was familiar to them.

Lat. 34. 21. is another cape which runs out be- yond 350, called by the Portuguese, who first doubled it, Cabo dos Agulhas, or the Cape of Needles, on ac¬ count of some strange variations in the magnetical needle observed as they came near it. Near this cape is a flat shore, with plenty of fish : it begins in the west near a fresh-water river, and, extending 15 leagues in the main sea, ends in the east near Fish-bay. Cabo Falso, so called by the Portuguese, who returning from India mistook it for the Cape of Good Hope, lies to the eastward between these two capes, about eight or time leagues beyond that of Good Hope. Along the coasts, on both sides of the Cape of Good Hope, are many fine bays. Twenty-seven leagues to the north¬ west is Saldanha bay, so named from a Portuguese cap¬ tain shipwrecked on the coast. The largest and most commodious is Table Bay, on the south, and near the mountain of that name, six leagues in circumference, with four fathoms water close to the beach. Opposite to this bay is Bobu Eilan, or the island of Rabbits in 34. 30. S. Lat. 67 leagues east from the Cape of Good Hope. Peter Both, in 1661, discovered a bay, which he named Uleest, sheltered only from north winds, in which is a small island, and on the west a rivulet of fresh water extremely convenient for European mariners","Cabo, Along, Saldanha","PT,IN,BR,ZA",6,"Portugal,India,Brazil,South Africa","Europe,Asia,South America,Africa"
"The women cover themselves much more scrupu¬ lously than the men, having always two, and very of¬ ten three coverings like aprons ; though even these seem to be abundantly small for what we would term decency in this country. The outermost of these, which is the largest, measures only from about six inches to a foot in breadth. All of them are made of a skin well prepa¬ red and greased, the outermost being adorned with glass beads strung in different figures. The outermost reaches about half-way down the thighs, the middle about a third or one half less, and the third scarcely exceeds the breadth of the hand. The first is said to he de¬ signed for ornament, the second as a defence for mo¬ desty, and the third to be useful on certain occasions, which, however, are much less troublesome to the Hot¬ tentot than to the European females. Our author, 4 I* with HOT [ 634 ] HOT Ho'lentol'. with great prohabilit}^, supposes tliat it was the sight ■ -t-- 'of this innermost apron which misled the reverend Je¬ suit Tackard, who, on his return to Europe, first pro¬ pagated the stories concerning the natural veils or ex- ciescences of the Hottentots.—A story was likewise commonly believed, that the men in general had but one testicle, and that such as were not naturally form¬ ed in this manner were artificially made so. But this our author likewise denies ; and though he says that such an operation might have been formerly performed upon the males, yet it is not so now",Ho,GH,6,Ghana,Africa
"Some kind of grease is afterwards used for the same purpose. The shoes are then made in the following manner. They take a piece of leather of a rectanga- hot [ 635 ] HOT Ho ntots. lar form, something longer and broader than the foot w. 'of the person for whom the shoes are intended j the two foremost corners are doubled up together, and sewed down, so as to cover the fore-part of the foot; but this seam may be avoided, and the shoes made much neater at the toes, by fitting immediately over them a cap taken from the membrane in the knee-joint of the hind-leg of some animal. In order to make this piece cf skin or leather rise up to the height of an inch on both sides of the foot, and close it in neatly, it is pierced with holes at small distances all round the edge, as far as the hind-quarters j and through these holes is passed a thong, by which the rim is drawn up into gathers. In order to make strong hind-quarters, the back part of the piece of leather is doubled inwards, and then raised up and pressed along the heel. The ends of the thong or gathering string are then threaded on both sides through the upper edge of the hind¬ quarters, to the height of about two inches •, they are then carried forwards in order to be drawn through two of the above-mentioned holes on the inside of each rim. Lastly, They are tied over the instep, or if it be thought necessary to tie the shoe still faster, they are carried crosswise over the instep, and so downwards under the thong, which comes out from the hind quar¬ ters 5 then upwards again over the ancle, and even round the leg itself if the wearer chooses. Shoes of this kind are not without their advantages : they sit as neat upon the foot as a stocking, and at the same time preserve their form. They are easily kept soft and pliable by constantly wearing them ; or if at any time they should become somewhat hard, this is easily remedied by beat¬ ing and greasing them. They are extremely light and cool, by reason that they do not cover so much of the foot as a common shoe. They wear very well, as they are without any seam, and the soles of the shoes are both tough and yielding. These field shoes, as they are called, being made of almost raw leather, are much more durable than those of tanned leather, which are burnt up by the African sands, and slip and roll about in them j being also very ready to be torn in a rocky soil, which is not the case with the others. The doctor is of opinion, that these shoes would be particularly use¬ ful to sailors. ■» The huts of the Hottentots are built exactly alike ; and we may readily give credit to our author when he tells us, that they are done in a style of architecture which does not a little contribute to keep envy from insinuating itself under the roofs. Some of these huts are circular, and others of an oblong shape, resembling a round bee-hive or vault j the ground-plot being from 18 to 24 feet in diameter. The highest are so low, that it is scarce ever possible for a middle-sized man to.stand upright even in the centre of the arch ; “ but (says our author) neither the lowness thereof, nor that of the door, which is but just three feet high, can ",Ho,GH,6,Ghana,Africa

He wrote in fa¬ vour of the re-union of Lutherans and Calvinists ; but he had no better success than all his predecessors in the same attempt.

And, by sub¬ sequent statutes, for the more regular assessment of this tax, the constable and two other substantial inhabitants of the parish, to be appointed yearly (or the surveyor appointed by the crown, together with such constable or other public officer), were, once in every year, em- [ 645 ] H O U powered to view the inside of every house in the pa- House rish.

"HOWARD, Henry, earl of Surrey, a soldier and a poet, the son and grandson of two lord treasurers, dukes of Norfolk, was born probably about the year 1520, and educated in Windsor castle, with young litzroy earl of Richmond, natural son to King Hen- ry VIII. Wood says, from tradition, that he was some time a student at Cardinal College, Oxford. In his youth he became enamoured of the Fair Geraldine, whom his sonnets have immortalized. In 1532, Howard with his companion Richmond was at Paris, where they continued some time. The latter died in 1536; after which our young hero made a tour to Italy, and at Florence, like a true enamorato, published a challenge against all comers, whether Christians, Jews, Saracens, Turks, or cannibals, in defence of the beau¬ ty of his fair Geraldine ; and was victorious in the tournament instituted by the grand duke on the occa- s on. The duke, we* are told, was so charmed with his gallant exploits, that he would gladly have retained him at his court j but be rejected tiie invitation, being determined to maintain the superlative beauty of his Geraldine in all the principal cities in Italy.

"Hoy, one of the Orkney islands, which lie off the north coast of Scotland, is situated between the island of Pomona and the north coast of Caithness, and is se¬ parated from the small island of Graemsay by a sound of a mile broad. The whole island is nearly occupied by three large hills, of which that to the north-east rises from a broad base to the height of 1200 feet. Some veins of lead and iron have been discovered in this island. Birch trees of considerable size seem to have been produced on it in former times. But at present its vegetable productions, excepting what are fit for sheep pasture, are extremely limited. A few hardy al¬ pine plants and stunted shrubs include the whole.

"Mr Hume being now turned of fifty, and having ob¬ tained by the sale of his books a competent and inde¬ pendent fortune, retired into his native country of Scotland, determined never more to set his foot out of it. From this resolution, however, he was diverted by the earl of Hertford ; whom he attended as secre¬ tary on his embassy to Paris in 1763. In 1765, the earl being appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Mr Hume was intrusted with the sole management of the business of the state till the arrival of the duke of Richmond towards the latter end of the year. In 1767, lie returned to Edinburgh, with a much larger income, procured to him by the earl of Hertford, than he formerly had ; and now formed the same design he had formerly entertained, namely, of burying himself in his philosophical retreat. In this, however, he was again disappointed, by receiving an invitation from Ge¬ neral Conway to be under secretary ; and this invita¬ tion he was prevented from declining, both by the character of the person, and his connexions with Lord Hertford. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh, pos¬ sessed of IQ00I. a-year, healthy, and though some¬ what stricken in years, yet having a prospect of long enjoying his ease, and of seeing the increase of his re¬ putation. Of his last illness and character, he him¬ self gives the following account. In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels ; which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits ; inso¬ much, that were I to name the period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this latter period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty- five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities ; and though I see many symptoms of my literary repu¬ tation breaking out at last with additional lustre, I know that I could have but few years to enjoy it.

"It is the custom of many to gallop the horse at a vio¬ lent rate as soon as he comes out of the water ; but this is extremely wrong for many reasons. It endangers the breaking a horse’s wind more than any other prac¬ tice, and often has been the occasion of bursting very good horses. It uses them also to the disagreeable trick we rind in many horses, of running away as soon as ever they come out of the water : and with some it makes them averse to drinking, so that they will rather en¬ dure thirst, and hurt themselves greatly by it, than bring on the violent exercise which they remember al¬ ways follows it. The better way is to walk him a little after he is out of the water, then put him to a gentle gallop for a little while, and after this to bring him to the water again. This should be done three or four times, till he will not drink any more. If thei’e is a hilly place near the watering place, it is always well to ride up to it: if otherwise, any place is to be chosen where there is free air and sun. That the creature may enjoy the benefit of this, he is not to be galloped, but walked about in this place an hour, and then taken home to the stable. The pleasure the horse himself takes in these airings when well managed is very evi¬ dent ; for he will gape, yawn, and shrug up his body : and in these, whenever he would stand still to stale, dung, or listen to any noise, he is not to be hindered Hunter, from it, but encouraged in every thing of this kind, »■ „ >mmi The advantages of these airings are very evident j they purify the blood, teach the creature how to make his breathing agree with the rest of the motions of his body, and give him an appetite to his food, which hun¬ ters and racers that are kept stalled up are otherwise very apt to lose. On returning from airing, the litter of the stable should be fresh, and by stirring this and whistling, he will be brought to stale. Then he is to be led to his stall, and tied up, and again carefully rub¬ bed down ; then he should be covered with a linen cloth next his body, and a canvas one over that, made to fit him, and reaching down to his legs. This, as the duke of Newcastle observes, is a custom which we learn¬ ed of the Turks, who are of all people the most nice and careful of their horses. Over this covering there should he put a body-cloth of six or eight straps ; this keeps his belly in shape, and does not hurt him. This clothing will be sufficient while the weather is not very sharp ; but in severe seasons, when the hair begins to rise and start in the uncovered part, a woollen cloth is to be added, and this will always prove fully suffi¬ cient",Newcastle,ZA,6,South Africa,Africa
"Mr Hunter arrived in London in the summer of 1741, and took up his residence at Mr, afterwards Dr, Smellie’s, who was at that time an apothecary in Pall Mall. He brought with him a letter of recommenda¬ tion to his countryman Dr James Douglas, from Mr Foulis, printer in Glasgow, who had been useful to the doctor in collecting for him different editions of Ho¬ race. Dr Douglas was then intent on a great anato¬ mical work on the bones, which he did not live to complete, and was looking out for a young man of abilities and industry whom he might employ as a dis¬ sector. This induced him to pay particular attention to Mr Hunter; and finding him acute and sensible, he desired him to make him another visit. A second con¬ versation confirmed the doctor in the good opinion he had formed of Mr Hunter ; and without any farther hesitation he invited him into his family to assist in his dissections and to superintend the education of his son.—Mr Hunter having accepted Dr Douglas’s invi¬ tation, was by his friendly assistance enabled to enter himself as a surgeon’s pupil at St George’s Hospital under Mr James Wilkie, and as a dissecting pupil un¬ der Dr Frank Nichols, who at that time taught ana¬ tomy with considerable reputation. He likewise at¬ tended a course of lectures on experimental philosophy by Dr Desaguliers. Of these means of improvement he did not fail to make a proper use.

If the rising-pipe be made wide, and thus room he made for the air to escape freely up through the wa¬ ter, it will rise to the height assigned ; but if it he nar¬ row, so that the air cannot get up, it rises almost as slow as the water, and by this circumstance the water is raised to a much greater height mixed with air, and this with hardly anv more power. It is in this way that we can account for the great performance of the Flo¬ rentine mac hine, which is almost triple of what a man can do with the finest pump that ever was made : in¬ deed the performance is so great, that one is apt to sus¬ pect some inaccuracy in the accounts. The entry into the rising-pipe should be no wider than the last part of the spiral ; and it would be advisable to divide it into four channels by a thin partition, and then to make the rising-pipe very wide, and to put into it a number ot slender rods, which would divide it into slender chan¬ nels that would completely entangle the air among the water. This will greatly increase the height of the he¬ terogeneous column. It is surprising that a machine that is so very promising should have attracted so little notice. We do not know of any being erected out of Switzerland, except at Florence in 1778. The account of its performance was in consequence of a very public trial in 1779, and honourable declaration of its merit, by Sig. Lorenzo Ginori, who erected another, which fully equalled it. It is shortly mentioned by Professor Sulzer of Berlin, in the Sammlungen Vermischlen Schri- sten for 1754. A description of it is published by the Philosophical Society at Zurich in 1766, and in the descriptions published by the Society in London for the encouragement of Arts in 1776. The celebrated Da¬ niel Bernouilli has published a very accurate theory of it in the Petersburgh Commentaries for 1772, and the machines at Florence were erected according to his in¬ structions. Baron Alstromer in Sweden caused a glass model of it to he made, to exhibit the internal motions for the instruction of artists, and also ordered an opera¬ tive engine to be erected; but we have not seen any account of its performance. It is a very intricate ma¬ chine in its principles j and an ignorant engineer, nay the most intelligent, may erect one which shall hardly do any thing •, and yet by a very trifling change, may become very powerful. We presume that failures of this kind have turned the attention of engineers from it j but we are persuaded that it may be made very ef- Plate fective, and we are certain that it must be very durable","Florence, Sig, Berlin, London, Florence","US,CH,SE,DZ,DE,GB",6,"United States,Switzerland,Sweden,Algeria,Germany,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe,Africa,Europe,Europe"
