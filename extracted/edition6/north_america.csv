"GOT Gothofred, OTHOFRED, or Godfrey, Denis or Diony- GoUen- SIUS> an emJnent civil lawyer, born of an illustrious bouse at Paris in 1549. Finding bis country invol¬ ved in the confusion of the leaguers, he accepted of a professor’s chair at Geneva, until he was patronized and employed by Henry IV.; but being afterwards stripped of his employments as a Huguenot, he at length retired to Heidelburg, from whence no offers were able to detach him. He was, however, disap¬ pointed of his intention to end his days there ; for the disturbances that broke out in the Palatinate obliged him, in 1621, to take refuge in Strasburg, where he died the following year. He wrote a great number of books; but his principal work is the Corpus Juris Ci- vilis, cum notis","Godfrey, Paris, Geneva",US,6,United States,North America
"Gothofred, Theodore, son of the former, was born at Geneva in 1580. As soon as he had .finished his studies, he went to Paris ; where he conformed to the Romish religion, and applied with indefatigable in¬ dustry to the study of history, that of France particu¬ larly, wherein he became very eminent, as appears by his works. In 1632, the king made him one of his historiographers, with a stipend of 3000 livres ; and, in 1636, he was sent to Cologne, to assist at the treaty of peace negociating there on the part of France, by the cardinal of Lyons. This treaty being removed to Munster, Gothofred was sent thither, where he drew up Memoirs on the subject; and continued in that city, in the king’s service, to his death in 1649. Princi“ pal work is his “ Account of the Ceremonial of the kings of France.” GOTTENBURG, or Gotheburg, a rich and strong town of West Gothland, in Sweden, with a good har¬ bour, at the mouth of the river Gothelba ; which is the best situated for foreign trade of any in Sweden, as it lies without the Sound. It occupies the site of an an¬ cient town, named Lodese, which was built by Gustavus Vasa ; and being endowed with considerable privileges, soon became the great emporium for the trade of the western provinces. Charles IX. when duke of Goth¬ land, having in 1604 laid the foundations of a new town in the island of Hisingen, at no great distance from Lo- dese, called Gotheborg (since corrupted into Gotten- burg'), in honour of his duchy ; upon his accession to the throne, he erected in his new town a trading company ; drew thither many foreigners, particularly the Dutch, to whom he allowed an exemption from all duties of export and import during 20 years; a corps of English and Vol. X. Part I. f GOT Scots troops under the command of William Stewart; Cotten- and granted to the Calvinists established therein the free Q0^tUjng’en< exercise of their religion, the first place in Sweden where this toleration was permitted. Ihe town being in 1611 reduced to ashes by the Danes, was rebuilt in the reign of Gustavus Adolphus in its present situation, and ob¬ tained a confirmation of its ancient rights, with the grant of several additional privileges.—It is built in a very sigular situation. At a small distance from the sea is a marshy plain, scarcely more than half a mile in breadth, watered by the rivers Gotha and Moldal, and almost entirely enclosed with high ridges of rocks, so bare and rugged, that they scarcely produce a single blade of grass, and exhibit as barren an appearance as the summits of the loftiest Alps. Gottenburg stands partly upon the ridges, and partly in the plain ; and is divided from these different situations into the Up¬ per and Lower Town. The latter is entirely level, in- , tersected by several canals in the manner of the Dutch towns; and its houses are all constructed upon piles ; the upper part hangs on the declivities ; and rows of buildings rise one above the other like the seats of an am¬ phitheatre. The whole is regularly fortified ; and its cir¬ cumference is near three miles, exclusive of the suburbs, called Haga, which lie toward the harbour. The streets are all uniformly straight: a few of the houses are of brick ; but the generality are constructed with wood painted red. The harbour is formed by two chains of rocks, and is about a quarter of a mile in breadth. Its entrance is defended by the fort of Newr Elfsborg, which stands upon a small rocky island, and contains a garrison of 250 men. There is at Gotten¬ burg a Royal Society of Sciences and Literature, upon the plan of that of Upsala.—Mr Coxe was informed by a merchant who had resided 22 years at Gottenburg, that, during that period, its population had increased considerably, and that it now contained about 30,000 inhabitants. This flourishing state is attributed to the extension of its commerce, particularly its East India Company, and the success of the herring-fishery. An English consul and several merchants of our nation reside at Gottenburg: and a chapel, with a regular chaplain, is appropriated to their use. E. Long.

"“ The gown, however, never became universal in Britain : and it seems to have been adopted only by the barons of the cities and the officers of the crown ; and has therefore been transmitted to us as the robe of reverence, the ensign of literature, and the mantle of magistracy. The wmollen and plaided garments of the chiefs having naturally superseded the leathern vestures of their clients, the former were still wore by the ge¬ nerality of the Britons $ and they were retained by the gentlemen of the country, and by the commonalty both in country and city. That this was the case, appears evident from the correspondent conduct of the Gauls and Britons; who kept their Virgata Sagula to the last, and communicated them to the Franks and Saxons. The plaided drapery of the Britons still ap¬ peared general in the streets of Manchester ; and must have formed a striking contrast to the gown of the chief, the dark mantle of Italy : and it Rnd the orna¬ mented buttons on the shoulder are preserved among us even to the present moment, in the parti-coloured clothing and the tasseled shoulder knots of our foot¬ men.” In some universities physicians wear a scarlet gown",Manchester,"IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

"CONJUNCTIONS-, by which name are distinguished all those CONNECTIVES WHICH ARE COM¬ MONLY EMPLOYED TO CONJOIN SENTENCES. These have been divided into two kinds, called And ‘CONJUNCTIVES, or those words which conjoin sentences and their meanings also 5 and DISJUNCTIVES, or those words which, at the same time that they conjoin sentences, disjoin their meanings. Each of these general divisions has-been again subdivided. The former into copulatives and continuatives, the latter into simple dis¬ junctives and adversative disjunctives. But the general division is absurd, and the subdivisions are useless. Conjunc- <[ tions never disjoin the meanings of sentences, nor have any other effect than to combine two or more simple sentences into one compound sentence. If those simple sentences be oi opposite meanings, before their combination, they will continue so after it, whatever conjunction be employed to unite them. In nature, DIFFERENT TRUTHS are connected, if they be connected at all, by different relations j and therefore when the sentences expressive of those truths are connected jti language, it must be by words significant of those NATURAL relations. Thus, 'Accidental addition is expressed by the conjunction and 5 as when we say, Lysippus was a statuary and Priscian was a grammarian.” "" The unexpected junction of contrary truths is expressed by but j as, “ Brutus was a patriot but Caesar was not.” The relation of an effect to its cause is expressed by because j as, “ Rome was enslaved because Caesar was ambitious.” The relation of an effect to a cause of which the existence is doubtful, by if j as, “ you will live happily if you live honestly.” The relation of a cause to its effect, by therefore j as, “ Caesar was ambitious therefore Rome was enslaved.” The idea of simple diversity is expressed by either and or ; as, “ either it is day or it is night.” Contrariety between two affirmations, which though each may be true by itself, cannot both be true at once, is expressed by unless j as, Troy will be taken unless the Palladium be preserved.” Coincidence of two affirmations apparently contrary to each other is expressed by although j as, “ Troy will be taken although Hector defend it.” PREPOSITIONS, or those connectives of which the common office is to conjoin words which refuse to coalesce j and this they can do only by signifying those relations BY WHICH THE things expressed by the united words are connected in nature. The words of men, like their first ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects j and therefore <! there can be no doubt but the original use of prepositions was to denote the various relations of body. Afterwards when men began to dicern with their intellect, they took those words which they found already made, prepositions as well as others, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual concep- tions. Prepositions therefore are either PROPER, or those which lite¬ rally denote the relations sub¬ sisting among the objects of sense. Such as Or The accidental junction of two things between which there is no necessary connection ; as, “ a house with a party wall.” The separation of two things which we should expect to find united ; as, “ a house without a roof, a man without hands.” The relation subsisting between any thing and that which supports it j as, “ the statue stands upon a pedestal.” The relations of higher and lower j as, “ the sun is risen above the hills To support uneasy steps over the burning marie :—The sun is set BELOW the hori¬ zon :—The shepherd reclines under the shade of a beech-tree.” The relation between any thing in motion and that in which it moves j as, “ the rays of light pass through the air.” The relation between any thing continued, whether motion or rest, and the point of its beginning 5 as, “ the rays of light proceed from the sun:— These figs came from Turkey -That lamp hangs FROM the ceiling.” The relation between any thing continued and the point to which it tends ; as, “ he is going to Italy :—He slept till morning.” The relation between an effect and its cause j as, “ I am sick of my husband and for my gallant.” Conjunctions and preposi¬ tions are indeed employed only to connect sentences and words ; but it may be doubted whether they be parts ofspeech distinct from nouns, verbs, and adjec¬ tives. -See Chap. VI","Rome, Rome, Troy, Troy","US,TR,IT",6,"United States,Turkey,Italy","North America,Asia,Europe"
"From this idea of the accusative, the reason is obvious why the object after the active verb is often put in that case j it is because the action is supposed to proceed from the agent to the patient. But the same thing happens with respect to the dative case, and for the same reason. Thus, Antonius lev sit Ciceronem, and Anto¬ nias nocuit Ciceroni, are expressions of the same import, and in each the action of hurting is conceived as pro¬ ceeding /row Antony to Cicero j which is finely illu¬ strated by the passive form of such expressions, where the procedure above mentioned is expressly marked by’ the preposition ah': Cicero nocetur, Cicero Iceditur ab An¬ tonio. It is therefore not true, that “ the accusative is that case, at least the otily case, which to an efficient nominative and a verb of action subjoins either the ef¬ fect or the passive subject j nor is the dative the. only case which is formed to express relatiorts tending to itself.” The only thing essential to these two cases is to denote the apposition ox junction of one object with an¬ other ; and this they do nearly, if not altogether, in the same manner, although from the custom of language they may not be indifferently subjoined to the same verb. ^ The Greek language has no ablative case : but in of the ab- the Latin, where it is used, it denotes concomitancy, orlative case, that one thing accompanies another. From this concomi¬ tancy we sometimes draw an inference, and sometimes not. For example, when it is said, Templum clamors petebant, clamour isrepresented concomitant with their going to the temple j and here no inference is drawn: but from the phrase palleo metu, although nothing more is expressed than that paleness is a concomitant of the fear, yet we instantly infer that it is also the effect of it. In most instances where the ablative is used, an inference is drawn, of which the foundation is some natural con¬ nection observed to subsist between the objects thus con¬ nected in language. When this inference is not meant to be drawn, the preposition is commonly added j as, in- Urfectus est cun gladio, “he was slain with a sword about him j” interfectus est gladio, “ he was slain with a sword as the instrument of his death.” 21 The remaining cases, which have not been noticed, Of the no- are the nominative and the vocative. These are in mostniinative instances alike in termination, which makes it probablea.nd v°ca- that they were originally one and the same case. Thetive case?3 foundation of this conjecture will appear from consi¬ dering the use to which each of these cases is applied","Antony, Cicero, Cicero, Of","US,FR,TR",6,"United States,France,Turkey","North America,Europe,Asia"
"Although the word Godis is as evidently an inflexion of the noun God as the word Dei is an inflexion of Dens, there are grammarians who have denied that in English there is any true inflexion of the original noun, and who have said that the noun with the addition of that syllable, which wre consider as the sign of a case, ceases to be a noun, and becomes a definitive; a word which with them is devoid of signification. Thus, in the expression Alexander’s house, the word Alexander’s stands not as a noun, but as an article or definitive, ser¬ ving to ascertain and point out the individuality of the house. But this is a palpable mistake : the word Alexander’s serves not to point out the individuality of the house, but to show to whom the house belongs; and is therefore beyond dispute, not an article, but a noun, in the possessive case. Again, when we say St Peter’s at Rome and St Paul’s at London, the words St Peter’s and St Paul’s are neither articles, nor, as has been ab¬ surdly imagined, the proper names of edifices, like the liotundo or the Circus ; but they are in the possessive case, the names of the two apostles to whom the churches were dedicated, and to whom they are sup¬ posed to belong","Rome, London","US,GB,UK",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"27. We have said that the article is a part of speech so very necessary, that without it, or some equivalent invention (f), mankind could not communicate their thoughts ; and that of words falling under this descrip- iS tion, we know of no language which is wholly destitute, irticles in w e are aware that these positions may be controvert- ie Latin e(] . an(j tjlat tj)e may be instanced as a language inguage.

That the Latin has been made to serve all these purposes cannot be denied, although Lucretius and Cicero both com¬ plain, that on the subject of philosophy, where the use of articles is most conspicuous, it is a deficient lan¬ guage. But should we grant what cannot be demand¬ ed, that those two great men were unacquainted with the powers of their native tongue, our positions would still remain unshaken j for we deny that the Latin is wholly without articles. It has indeed no word of pre¬ cisely the same import with our THE or the Greek « j but the place of the indefinite article A might be al¬ ways supplied, if necessary, with the numerical word unus. It may be so even in English ; for we believe there is not a single instance where the words one man, one horse, one virtue, might not be substituted for the words a man, a horse, a virtue, &c. without in the slightest degree altering the sense of the passage where such words occur. This substitution, however, can be but very seldom if ever necessary in the Latin tongue, of which the precision is much greater than that of the English would be without articles j because the oblique cases of the Latin nouns, and the inflexion of its verbs, will almost always enable the reader to deter¬ mine whether an appellative represents a whole species or a single individual.—The want of the definite article THE seems to be a greater defect ; yet there are few instances in which its place might not be supplied by this or by that without obscuring the sense; and the Latin tongue is by no means deficient of articles cor¬ responding to these two. Let us substitute the words ONE and that for A and THE in some of the foregoing examples, and we shall find, though the sound may be uncouth, the sense will remain.

"In the first oration against Catiline, Cicero begins with addressing himself in a very impassioned style to the traitor, who was present in the senate-house.

"Ihap/II. GRAM .nicies, obliged to have recourse to adjectives or epithets. For —v '* example, there were two Grecian chiefs who bore the name of Ajax; and it was not without reason that Mnestheus used epithets when his intention was to dis¬ tinguish the one from the other : “If both Ajaxes cannot be spared (said he), at least let mighty Telamo- nian Ajax come.” But as epithets are diffused through various subjects, in as much as the same adjective may be referred to many substantives, it has been said to be necessary, in order to render both parts of speech equally definite, that the adjective itself assume an ar¬ ticle before it, which may indicate a reference to some single person onhj. It is thus we say—Trypho the Grammarian; Apollodorus THE Cyrenian, &c. This •is the doctrine of Mr Harris ; from which, though we have the highest respect for the learning of the author, we feel ourselves obliged to dissent. In the examples given, the article the is certainly not associated with the words Grammarian and Cyrenian, in the same man¬ ner in which it is associated with the word man in the sentence—“ The man that hath not music in himself,” &c. When we say Apollodorus the Cyrenian, we may, without folly or impertinence, be asked—the Cyreman what (g) ? And the moment this question is answer¬ ed, it will be seen that the article defines, not an adjec¬ tive, but a substantive.

Thus Mr Pitt may speak of himself as first lord of the treasury, chancellor of the exchequer, or member for the university of Cambridge; and in each case he would be what Mr Harris calls the subject of conversation: yet everyone feels that none of these designations is equivalent to /. What then is the force of the personal pronouns ? ^ 37. It appears to be simply this: lihefirst denotes the The re# speaker, AS CHARACTERISED BY THE PRESENT ACT OF import 0 speaking in contradistinction to every other character^™' which he may bear. The second denotes the party ad¬ dressed, as CHARACTERISED BY THE PRESENT CIRCUM¬ STANCE OF BEING ADDRESSED, in contradistinction to every other character, &c.: And what is called the pro¬ noun of the third person is merely a NEGATION OF THE OTHER TWO, as the neuter gender is a negation of the masculine and feminine. If this account of the personal pronouns be true, and we flatter ourselves that its truth will be obvious to every body, there is but one way of ex¬ pressing by other words the force of the pronouns of the first and second person. Thus, “ The person who now speaks to you did so and so,” is equivalent to “ I did so and so j” and “The person to whom I now address myself did so and so,” is equivalent to “ You did so and so.” Hence we see why it is improper to say the I or the thou j for each of these pronouns has of itself the force of a noun with the definite article prefixed, and denotes a person of whom something is predicted, which distinguish¬ es him from all other persons. I is the person who now speaks, thou is the person who is now addressed by the speaker. Hence too we see the reason why the pronoun 1 is said to be of the first, and the pronoun THOU of the second person. T hese pronouns can have place only in conversation, or when a man, in the character of a public speaker, addresses himself to an audience ; but it is obvious, that there must be a speaker before there can be a hearer; and therefore, that the pronouns may fol¬ low the order of nature, 1, which denotes the person of the speaker, must take place of THOU, which denotes^ the person of the hearer. Now the speaker and the hearer being the only persons engaged in conversation or declamation, I is with great propriety called the pronoun of the first, and thou the pronoun of the se¬ cond person. 'VVe have said, that, with respect to pro¬ nouns, the third person, as it is called, is merely a nega¬ tive of the other two. This is evident from the slightest attention to the import of those words which are called pronouns of the third person. He, she, or it, denotes not the person either of the speaker or of the hearer; and, GRAMMAR",Cambridge,US,6,United States,North America
"Thus in the English language we sayr, The man or the woman who went to Rome ; The tree which stands on yonder plain. It admits likewise, when applied to males or females, a variation of cases similar to that of the personal pronouns. Thus we say, The man whose book is now before me ; The man or woman whom I saw yesterday: but the neuter admits of no such distinction (n) ; as we say the tree which I saw, as well as the tree which stands on yonder plain. In modern lan¬ guages the relative admits not of any distinction to de¬ note number ; for we say, The man or the men who came yesterday ; The man or the men of whom I speak. -c 54. In English, the word THAT, which by some has The woi been called a demonstrative pronoun, by others a prono- ttiat olu minal article, and by us a definite article, is often used instead of the relative, as in the following examples: ^ “ He is the same man that I saw yesterday:—He wasncdn",Rome,"US,UK",6,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"

"87. Besides original adjectives, there is another class, which is formed from substantives. Thus, when we say, the party of Pompey, the style of Cicero, the philosophy of Socrates ; in these cases, the party, the style, and the philosophy spoken of, receive a stamp and character from the persons whom they respect: Those persons, there¬ fore, perform the part of attributes. Hence they actu¬ ally pass into attributives, and assume as such the form of adjectives. It is thus we say, the Hompeian party, the Ciceronian style, and the Socratic philosophy. In like manner, for a trumpet of brass, we say a bra-zen trumpet, and for a crown of gold, a golden crown, &c. Fven pronominal substantives admit the like mutation. Thus, instead of saying the book of me, and of thee, we say my book, and thy book j and instead of saying, the country of us, and of you, we say our country, and ijour country.

But when we say, il Pliny was moderately eloquent, but Cicero exceedingly eloquent', Statius wrote indifferently, but Virgil wrote admirably the words moderately, exceedingly, indifferently, and ad¬ mirably, are not referable to substantives, but to other attributes; that is, to the words eloquent and wrote, the signification of which they modify.

This classification was certainly absurd ; for it confounds not only adjectives and participles, but even substantives, with verbs : but the authority of Aristotle was great and hence the name of adverb, though that word attaches itself only to an adjective or participle, or a verb significant of an attribute: it does not attach itself to the pure verb*","Cicero, Cicero",US,6,United States,North America
"But when we use the comparative degree, the objects compared are set in direct opposition ; and the one is con¬ sidered not as a part of the other, or as comprehended under it, hut as something altogether distinct and be¬ longing to a different class. Thus, were one to say, “ Cicero was more eloquent than the Romans,” he would speak absurdly ; because every body knows, that of the class of men expressed by the word Romans Cicero was one, and such a sentence would affirm that orator to have been more eloquent than himself. But when it is said that “ Cicero was more eloquent than all the other Komans, or than oLfer Roman,” the language is proper, and the affirmation true : for though the persons spoken of were all of the same class or city, yet Cicero is here set in contradistinction to the rest of his countrymen, and is not considered as one of the persons with whom he is compared. It is for this reason that in English the comparalh'e degree is follow¬ ed by a noun governed by the word of contradistinc¬ tion than, and in Latin by a noun in the ablative case governed by the preposition pree (b) either expressed or understood. We have already observed, that the ablative case denotes concornttancy: and therefore when (b) See Ruddimanni Grammaticce Institutiones, Pars secunda, lib. i. cap. 2","Cicero, Cicero, Cicero","US,UK",6,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"

"An bnpi o- to adversative disjunctives, it has been already said, per dhtiuc- after Mr Harris, that they imply opposition : but the tiou. truth seems to be, that they only unite in the same sen¬ tence words ovphrases of opposite meanings. Now it is obvious, that opposite attributes cannot belongtothe same subject; as when we say, Nereus was beautiful, we can¬ not superadd to this sentence, that he was ugly; we cannot say, he was beautiful but ugly. When there is opposition, it must be either of the same attribute in different subjects; as when we say, li Brutus was a pa¬ triot, BUT Ccesar was not:” Or of different attributes in the same subject j as when we say “ Gorgiusw&s a so¬ phist, but not & philosopher.” Or of different attributes in different subjects; as when we say, ” Plato was a philo¬ sopher, BUT Hippias was a sophist.” The conjunctions used for all these purposes hare been called absolute ad- versatives, we think improperly, as the opposition is not marked by the conjunctions, but by the words or sentences which they serve to connect. Mr Locke, speaking of the word but, says, that “ it sometimes intimates ft stop of the mind, in the course it was going, before it came to the end of itto which Mr Tooke replies with truth, that but itself is the farthest of any word in the language from intimating a stop. On the contrary, it always intimates something to follow; insomuch, that when any man in discourse finishes his words with BUT, instead of supposing him to have stopped, we always ask, BUT what ?- Besides the adversatives already mentioned, there are two other species, of which the most important are un¬ less and ALTHOUGH. For example, “ Troy will be taken, UNLESS the palladium be preserved; Troy will be taken, ALTHOUGH Hector defend it.” The na¬ ture of these adversatives may be thus explained. As every event is naturally allied to its cause, so by parity of reason it is opposed to its,preventive; and as every cause is either adequate ox inadequate (inadequate when it endeavours without being effectual), so in like man¬ ner is every preventive. Now adequate preventives are expressed by such adversatives as UNLESS : “ Troy will be taken, UNLESS the palladium be preserved that is, this alone is sufficient to prevent it. The inadequate are expressed by such adversatives as ALTHOUGH: “ Troy will be taken ALTHOUGH Hector defend itthat is, Hector's defence will prove ineffectual.

"And a little consideration of the organs and practice of speech will convince him how easily AGD or act would become ad or at •, as indeed this preposition was indifferently written either way by the ancients. By the later writers of Rome, the preposition was written AD with D only, in order to distinguish it from the other corrupt word called the conjunction at ; which for the same reason was written with the T only, though that likewise had anciently been written, as the preposition, either AD or AT. The preposition TO and the conjunction too in Eng¬ lish, are both in syntax and in meaning used exactly as the preposition AD and the conjunction AT in Latin. From tiie specimens prefixed to Johnson’s dictionary, as a history of our language, it appears that, as late as the reign of Elizabeth, the preposition and conjunction were both written with one O. And it has been shown in the first vo¬ lume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that TO and TOO, as well as AD and AT, are precisely of the same import. The only difference, in either language, between the preposition and the conjunction, is, that the former directs, as a modification of some previous proposition, the addition ot some substantive or noun ; the latter, sometimes a sentence or clause of a sentence considered abstractly as a noun ; and that, when the former h used, the preposition, to which the modifying circumstance is to be added, \s formally expressed, hot omitted when the latter is employed.

"The Moors have left more monuments in Granada than in any other city in Spain. From the great num¬ ber of inscriptions in and about the city, and the fine edifices of the Alhambra and the Generalif, it might be supposed these people intended to make Granada the greatest depository of their religion, manners, cu¬ stoms, and magnificence. There is not a wall which does not bear some marks of their power $ but, not¬ withstanding this abundance of monuments, the reign of the Moors in Spain is still buried in confusion and obscurity. The ignorance of the Spaniards, their su¬ perstition, and the hatred they bore the Moors, have much contributed to this darkness-, they have either destroyed, or suffered to be eftaced by time, every thing which bore the mark of Mahometanism, instead of preserving the monuments of antiquity, which at the same time were those of their own glory j and it may be said, that chance alone, and the solidity of their con¬ struction, much more than curiosity or a love of the arts, has preserved those which still exist, though daily going to ruin. - An account of the Alhambra has been already gi¬ ven under its name in the order of the alphabet. From the hall of Comares there mentioned, there is a modern little staircase the old one, which corresponded to the beauty of the edifice, having been destroyed. At the top of the staircase is a gallery, a part of which is in¬ closed with an iron railing : this kind of cage is called the prison of the queen. It was here the wife of the last king of Granada was imprisoned. The Gomels and Legris, two families of distinction, bore false wit¬ ness against her virtue, and occasioned the destruc¬ tion of the greatest part of the Abencerrages, another 64 ] G R A powerful and numerous family of Granada of whom they were jealous. The history of this event is given as follows : In the year 1491, Abdali, surnamed the Little, still reigned in Granada j but this city was upon the brink of ruin, for the principal families were divided against each other. The Moors had carried their arms against Jaen, and had been bravely repulsed. Abdali was con¬ soling himself in one of his pleasure houses for the ill success of his enterprise, when the Zegris, who long had been the secret enemies of the Abencerrages, took the opportunity of this defeat to represent them to the king as rebellious subjects, who employed their immense riches to gain the favour of the people and dethrone their sovereign. They accused Albin Ha- met, the most rich and powerful among them, of ha¬ ving an adulterous commerce with the queen, and pro¬ duced witnesses who asserted they had on a certain fe¬ stival seen, at Generalif, under a bower of rose trees, Albin Hamet in the arms of that princess. The fury of Abdali may easily be imagined j he swore the de¬ struction of the Abencerrages. But the Zegris, too prudent to let his anger break forth, advised him to dissimulate, and not to suffer it to be known to that numerous and powerful family that he was informed of their perfidy. It will be better, said they, to entice them into the snare, and, before they can unite and put themselves into a state of defence, revenge upon their heads the insult offered to the crown. This ad¬ vice was followed ; Abdali went to the Alhambra, having ordered thirty of his guards to arm themselves, and the executioner to attend. The Abencerrages were sent for one by one, and beheaded as soon as they entered the hall of the lions, where there is still a large vase of alabaster,"" which was quickly filled with blood and the heads of expiring bodies. Thirty-five heads had already been struck off, and all the Abencerrages would have died in the same manner, had not a page, who had followed his master, and remained unpercei¬ ved in the hurry of the execution, taken an opportu¬ nity of withdrawing and giving information to the rest of the unhappy family of what had passed. These im¬ mediately assembled their friends in arms, crying out through the city of Granada, “ Treason ! treason !

For several days nothing but sighs and groans were heard throughout the city. Abdali shut himself up in the castle, and refused to see the queen. Those who had accused her of adultery, however, persisted in their false accu¬ sation, and said, they would maintain, with arms in their hands, against all who should contradict them, that the queen was guilty. The unhappy princess was imprisoned, and the day arriving on which she was to perish by the hands of the executioner, when none among the Moors offering to defend her, she was ad¬ vised to commit her cause to some Christian knights, who presented themselves at the time appointed, and conquered her false accusers, so that she was immedi¬ ately set at liberty.

"The two great cautions to be observed in the erect¬ ing of granaries are, to make them sufficiently strong, and to expose them to the most drying winds. The ordering of the corn in many parts of England, parti¬ cularly in Kent, is thus: To separate it from dust and other impurities after it is thrashed, they toss it with shovels from one end to the other of a long and large room ; the lighter substances fall down in the middle of the room, and the corn only is carried from side to side or end to end of it. After this they screen the corn, and then bringing it into the granaries, it is spread about half a foot thick, and turned from time to time about twice in a Week y once a-week they also repeat the screening it. This sort of management they continue about two months, and after that they lay it a foot thick for two months more*, and in this time they turn it once a-week, or twice if the season be damp, and now and then screen it again. After about five or six months they raise it to two feet thickness in the heaps, and then they turn it once or twice in a month, and screen it now and then. After a year, they lay it two and a half or three feet deep, and turn it once in three weeks or a month, and screen it proportion- ably. When it has lain two years or more, they turn k once in two months, and screen it once a-quarter y and how long soever it is kept, the oftener the turn¬ ing and screening are repeated, the better the grain will Grajlar? be found to be.—It is proper to leave an area of a 1— yard wide on every side of the heap of corn, and other empty spaces, into which they turn and toss the coin as often as they find occasion. In Kent they make two square holes at each end of the floor, and one round in the middle, by means of which they throw the corn out of the upper into the lower rooms, and so up again, to turn and air it the better. Their screens are made with two partitions, to separate the dust from the corn, which falls into a bag, and when sufficiently full this is thrown away, the pure and good corn remaining behind. Corn has by these means been kept in our granaries 30 years y and it is obser¬ ved, that the longer it is kept the more flour it yields in proportion to the corn, and the purer and whiter the bread is, the superfluous humidity only evapora¬ ting in the keeping. At Zurich in Swisserland, they keep corn 80 years, or longer, by the same sort of me¬ thods",Kent,US,6,United States,North America
"But though a plain object of that kind be agreeable it is not termed grand: it is not entitled to that cha¬ racter, unless, together with its size, it be possessed of other qualities that contribute to beauty, such as regu- larity, proportion, order, or colour : and according to the number of such qualities combined with magnitude, it is more or less grand. Thus St Peter’s church at Rome, the great pyramid of Egypt, the Alps towering above the clouds, a great arm of the sea, and above all a clear and serene sky, are grand j because, beside their size, they are beautiful in an eminent degree. On the other hand, an overgrown whale, having a disagreeable appearance, is not grand. A large building, agreeable by its regularity and proportions, is grand •, and yet a much larger building, destitute of regularity, has not the least tincture of grandeur. A single regiment in battle-array, makes a grand appearance j which the surrounding crowd does not, though perhaps ten for one. in number. And a regiment where the men are all in one livery, and the horses of one colour, makes a grander appearance, and consequently strikes more ter¬ ror, than where there is confusion of colour and dress. , Thus greatness or magnitude is the circumstance thatGfSnd distinguishes grandeur from beauty: agreeableness isdistinf the genus, of which beauty and grandeur are species",Rome,"EG,US",6,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

"The returning in an opposite direction is not positively painful, though our pleasure lessens at every step, till it vanish into indifference : such a progress may some¬ times produce pleasure of a different sort, which arises from taking a narrower and narrower inspection. The same observation holds in a progress upward and down¬ ward. Ascent is pleasure because it elevates us 5 but de¬ scent is never painful : it is for the most part pleasant from a dilferent cause, that it is according to the order of nature. The fall of a stone from any height, is ex¬ tremely agreeable by its accelerated motion. We feel it pleasant to descend from a mountain, because the descent is natural and easy. Neither is looking downward painful ; on the contrary, to look down up¬ on objects, makes part of the pleasure of elevation : looking down becomes then only painful when the ob¬ ject is so far below as to create dizziness ; and even when that is the case, we feel a sort of pleasure mixed with the pain : witness Shakespeare’s description of Dover cliffs :       How fearful _ And dizzy ’tis, to cast one’s eye so low !

"The resemblance in feeling between real and figura¬ tive grandeur is humorously illustrated by Addison in criticising upon English tragedy-f. “The ordinary \ Spectator, method of making a hero is to clap a huge plume of^0'4*' feathers upon his head, which rises so high, that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head than to the sole of his foot. One would be¬ lieve, that we thought a great man and a tall man the same thing. As these superfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man, a princess generally receives her grandeur from those additional incumbrances that fall into her tail : I mean the broad sweeping train that follows her in all her motions, and finds constant employment for a boy who stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage.” The Scythians, impres¬ sed with the fame of Alexander, were astonished when they found him a little man",Addison,"US,UK",6,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"Within certain limits grandeur and sublimity pro¬ duce their strongest effects, which lessen by excess as well as by defect. This is remarkable in grandeur and sublimity taken in their proper sense : the grandest emotion that can be raised by a visible object is where the object can be taken in at one view : if so im¬ mense as not to be comprehended but in parts, it tends rather to distract than, satisfy the mind (a) : in like manner, the strongest emotion produced by ele¬ vation is where the object is seen distinctly j a greater elevation lessens in appearance the object, till ^ it vanish out of sight with its pleasant emotions. The Figurative same is equally remarkable in figurative grandeur and grandeur, elevation *, which shall be handled together, because, as observed above, they are scarcely distinguishable. Sen¬ timents may be so strained as to become obscure, or to exceed the capacity of the human mind : against such license of imagination, every good writer will be upon his guard. And therefore it is of greater importance to observe, that even the true sublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the highest enter¬ tainment. We are undoubtedly susceptible of a greater elevation than can be inspired by human actions the most heroic and magnanimous , witness what we feel from Milton’s description of superior beings : yet every man must be sensible of a more constant and sweet elevation when the history of his own species is the (a) It is justly observed by Addison, that perhaps a man would have been more astonished with the majestic air that appeared in one of Lysippus’s statues of Alexander, though no bigger than the life, than he might have been with Mount Athos, had it been cut into the figure of the hero, according to the proposal of Phidias, with a","Milton, Addison",US,6,United States,North America
". In the description of a storm, to figure Jupiter throwing down huge mountains with his thunder¬ bolts, is hyperbolically sublime, if we may use the expression: the tone of mind produced by that image is so distant from the tone produced by a thick shower of rain, that the sudden transition must be un¬ pleasant",Jupiter,US,6,United States,North America
"“ Grandeur, being an extremely vivid emotion, is not readily produced in perfection but by reiterated im¬ pressions. The effect of a single impression can be but momentary ; and if one feel suddenly somewhat like a swelling or exaltation of mind, the emotion va- nisheth as soon as felt. Single thoughts or sentiments are often cited as examples o{ the sublime j but their effect is far inferior to that ot a grand subject displayed in its capital parts. We shall give a few examples, that the reader may judge for himself. In the famous ac¬ tion of Thermopylae, where Teonidas the Spartan king, with his chosen band, fighting for their country, were cut off to the last man, a saying is reported of Di eneces, one of the band, which, expressing cheer¬ ful and undisturbed bravery, is well entitled to the first place in examples of that kind : talking of the number of their enemies, it was observed, that the arrows shot such a multitude would intercept the light of the i 5 “ So much the better (says he), for we shall then fight in the shade.” Somerset.

"His private charities were very considerable, and grew in the same proportion with his profits.

He was such an enemy to oppression, that he never denied his assistance to such as laboured un¬ der it j and with respect to the clergy of all professions (in Scotland), his conscience obliged him to serve them without a fee. When his merit had raised him to the bench, he thought himself accountable to God and man for Ids conduct in that high office: and that deep sense of his duty, at the same time that it kept him strictly to it, encouraged and supported him in the performance. Whenever he sat as lord ordinary, the paper of causes was remarkably full j for his reputation being equally established for knowledge and integrity, there were none, who had a good opinion of their own pretensions, but were desirous of bringing them before him, and not many who did not sit down sa¬ tisfied with his decision. This prevailed more espe¬ cially after it was found that few of his sentences were reversed *, and when they were, it was commonly owing to himself: for if, upon mature reflection, or upon new reasons offered at the re-hearing, he saw any just ground for altering his judgment, he made no scruple of de¬ claring it ; being persuaded that it was more manly, as well as more just, to follow truth, than to support opi¬ nion : and his conduct in this respect had a right effect|j for instead of lessening, it raised his reputation. He would not, however, with all this great stock of know¬ ledge, experience, and probity, trust himself on matters of blood, or venture to decide in criminal cases on the lives of his fefjow-creatures j which was the reason that, though often solicited, he could never be prevail¬ ed upon to accept of a seat in the justiciary court.— In his private character he was as amiable as he was respectable in his public. He was charitable without ostentation, disinterested in his friendships, and bene¬ ficent to all who had any thing to do with him.

"—Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant, descend¬ ed of a noble family in Italy, had gained a plentiful fortune, of which he was liberal-handed to all in ne¬ cessity ; which being well known to others, though concealed by himself, a young stranger applied to him for charity. Signior Frescobald, seeing something in his countenance more than ordinary, overlooked his tat¬ tered clothes; and compassionating his circumstances, asked him “ What he was, and of what country.’* “ I am (answered the young man) a native of Eng¬ land ; my name is Thomas Cromwell, and my father- in-law is a poor sheer-man. I left my country to seek my fortune ; came with the French army that were routed at Gatylion, where I was a page to a footman, and carried his pike and burgonet after him.” Fres¬ cobald commiserating his necessities, and having a particular respect for the English nation, clothed him genteelly ; took him into his house till he had recover¬ ed strength by better diet; and, at his taking leave, mounted him upon a good horse, with 16 ducats of gold in his pockets. Cromwell expressed his thank¬ fulness in a very sensible manner, and returned by land towards England ; where, being arrived, he was pre¬ ferred into the service of Cardinal Wolsey. After the cardinal’s death, he worked himself so effectually into the favour of King Henry VIII, that his majesty made him a baron, viscount, earl of Essex, and at last made him lord high chancellor of England. In the mean time, Signior Frescobald, by repeated losses at sea and land, was reduced to poverty ; and calling to mind (without ever thinking of Cromwell), that some Eng¬ lish merchants were indebted to him in the sum of 15,000 ducats, he came to Eondon to procure payment",Essex,"IT,US,FR,UK",6,"Italy,United States,France,N/A","Europe,North America,Europe,N/A"
"Travelling in pursuit of this affair, he fortunately met with the lord chancellor as he was riding to court; who thinking him to be the same gentleman that had done him such great kindness in Italy, he immediately alighted, embraced him, and with tears of joy asked him, “ If he was not Signior Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant?” “ Yes, Sir (said he) and your most humble servant.” “ My servant! (said the chan¬ cellor) No ; you are my special friend, that relieved me in G Pv A ' L 79 ] G P A e. in my wants, laid the foundation of my greatness, and, as such, I receive you j and, since the afiairs of my so¬ vereign will not now permit a longer conference, I beg you will oblige me this day with your company at my house to dinner with me.” Signior Frescobsld was surprised and astonished with admiration who this great man should be that acknowledged such obligations, and so passionately expressed a kindness tor him j but, con¬ templating a while his voice, his mien, and carriage, he concludes it to be Cromwell, whom he had relieved at Florence j and therefore not a little overjoyed, fjoes to his house, and attended his coming. His lordship came soon after j and immediately taking his friend by the hand, turns to the lord high admiral and other no¬ blemen in his company, saying, “ Don’t your lordships wonder that I am so glad to see this gentleman ? This is he who first contributed to my advancement.” He then told them the whole story y and holding him still by the hand, led him into the dining-room, and placed him next himself at table. The company being gone, the chancellor made use of this opportunity to know what affair had brought him into England* Frescobald in few words gave him the true state of his circumstan¬ ces : To which Cromwell replied, “ I am sorry for your misfortunes, and I will make them as easy to you as I can y but, because men ought to be just before they are kind, it is fit I should repay the debt I owe you.” Then leading him into his closet, he locked the door; and opening a coffer, first took out 16 ducats, delivering them to Frescobald, and said, “ My friend, here is the money you lent me at Florence, with ten pieces you laid out lor my apparel, and ten more you laid out for my horse; hut, considering you are a mer¬ chant, and might have made some advantage of this money in the way of trade, take these four bass, in every one of which is 400 ducats, and enjoy them as the free gift of your friend.” These the modesty of Frescobald would have refused, but the other forced them upon him. He next caused him to give him the names of all his debtors, and the sums they owed : which account he transmitted to one of his servants, with a charge to find out the men, and oblige them to pay him in 15 days under the penalty of his displea¬ sure ; and the servant so well discharged his duty, that in a short time the entire sum was paid. All this time Signior Frescobald lodged in the chancellor’s house, where he was entertained according to his merits, with repeated persuasions for his continuance in England, and an offer of the loan of 60,000 ducats for four years if he would trade here : but he desired to return to Florence, which he did, with extraordinary favours from the lord Cromwell","Florence, Florence, Florence","US,IT",6,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"

The former must not take in above forty passengers, the latter no more than eight. Coaches ply here at the landing of people from London, &c. to carry them to Rochester. This town and Milton were incorporated by Queen Elizabeth by the name of the portreeve, (now the mavor), jurats, and inhabitants of Gravesend and Milton : And as Gravesend is the place where most passengers through Kent from foreign parts take boat for London, that queen, in order to show the grandeur of the metropolis of her kingdom, order¬ ed the lord mayor, aldermen, and city companies, to receive all ambassadors and eminent strangers here in their formalities, and to attend them to London in barges if by water; or if they chose to come by land, they rvere to meet them on horseback on Black- heath in their livery gowns. The towns for several miles round are supplied from hence with garden stuffs; of which great quantities are also sent to London, where the asparagus of Gravesend is preferred to that of Battersea. All outward-bound ships are obliged to anchor in this road till they have been visited by the customhouse officers; and for this purpose a centinel at the blockhouse fires a musket: but the homeward- bound all pass by without notice, unless it be to put waiters on board, if they are not supplied before. As the outward-bound generally take in provisions here, the place is full of seamen, who are all in a hurry","Kent, London, Essex, Milton, London, London, Rochester, Milton, Gravesend, Milton, Gravesend, Kent, London, London, London, Gravesend, Battersea","GB,US,FR",6,"United Kingdom,United States,France","Europe,North America,Europe"

"He was educated at Eton, where he contracted a friend¬ ship with Mr Horace Walpole, and with Mr Richard West son of the lord chancellor of Ireland. Mr West and Mr Gray were both intended for the bar: but the former died early in life, and the latter was diverted from that pursuit by an invitation to accompany Mr Walpole in his travels ; which he accepted without any determined plan for his future life. During Mr Gray’s travels, he Wrote a variety of letters to Mr West and to his parents, which are printed with his poems ; and when he returned, finding himself in narrow circum¬ stances, yet with a mind indisposed for active employ¬ ment, he retired to Cambridge, and devoted himself to study. Soon after his return, his friend West died ; and the melancholy impressed on him by this event may be traced in his admired “ Elegy written in a country churchyard j” which is thought to have been begun, if not finished, at this time ; though the conclusion, as it stands at present, is certainly different from what it was in the first manuscript copy. The first impulse ot his sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender sonnet in English, on the Petrarchian model j and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexame¬ ters, written in the genuine strain of classical majesty, with which he intended to begin one of his books De Principiis Cogitandi",Cambridge,"IE,US,UK",6,"Ireland,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"From the winter of the year 1742, to the day of his death, his principal residence was at Cambridge ; from which he u'as seldom absent any considerable time, ex¬ cept between the years 1759 and 1762 ; when on the opening of the British Museum, he took lodgings in Southampton-row, in order to have recourse to the Harleian and other manuscripts there deposited, from which he made several curious extracts, amounting in all to a tolerable sized folio, at present in the hands of Mr Walpole",Cambridge,US,6,United States,North America
"About the year 1747, Mr Mason, the editor of Mr Gray’s poems, was introduced to him. The former had written, a year or two before, some imitations of Milton’s juvenile poems, viz. A Monody on the Death of Mr Pope, and two pieces entitled II Bellicoso and II Pacifico on the peace of Aix la-Chapelle ; and the latter revised them at the request of a friend. This laid the foundation of an intimacy which continued without interruption to the death of Mr Gray",Milton,US,6,United States,North America
"From July 1759 to the year 1762, he generally re- Ij sided G R A [ 82 ] G R A Gray, sided in London, with a view, as we have already ob- v~'—•• served, of having recourse to the British Museum. In July 1786, his grace the duke of Grafton wrote him a polite letter, informing him, that his majesty had been pleased to offer to him the professorship ol Mo¬ dern History in the university of Cambridge, then va¬ cant by the death of Mr Laurence Brocket. This place was valuable in itself, the salary being 400I. a year "", but what rendered it particularly acceptable to Mr Gray was its being given him without any solici¬ tation. He was indeed remarkably disinterested in all his pursuits. Though his income, before this addi¬ tion, was very small, he never read or wrote with a view of making his labours useful to himself. He may be said to have been of those few personages in the annals of literature, especially in the poetical class, who are devoid of self-interest, and at the same time attentive to economy $ and also was among mankind in general one of those very few economists, who pos¬ sess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain of avarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in private charity, as would have done credit to an ampler purse. But what chiefly deterred him from seeking any advantage by his lite¬ rary pursuits, was a certain degree of pride, which led him to despise the idea of being thought an author by profession","London, Grafton, Cambridge","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"However, it is probable, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of Strabo } for his papers contain a great number of notes and geo¬ graphical disquisitions on that author, particularly with respect to that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he has left upon almost every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that philosopher than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncom¬ mon labour was the Anthologia. In an interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has tran¬ scribed several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading ; has inserted a great number of cri¬ tical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, is uncertain. The only work which he meditated upon with this direct view from the be¬ ginning was a history of English poetry, upon a plan sketched out by Mr Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to those three fine imita¬ tions of Norse and Welsh poetry, which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems. But after he had made some considerable preparations for the exe¬ cution of this design, and Mr Mason had offered him his assistance, he was informed, that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relin¬ quished, by mutual consent; and soon after, on that gentleman’s desiring a sight of the plan, our author readily sent him a copy of it","Asia, Plato, Oxford","IN,PH,CO,US,GR,UK,GB",6,"India,Philippines,Colombia,United States,Greece,N/A,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,South America,North America,Europe,N/A,Europe"
"Among other sciences, Mr Gray had acquired a great knowledge of Gothic architecture. He had seen and accurately studied in his youth, while abroad, the Roman proportions on the spot, both in ancient times, and in the works of Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to consider those stupendous structures Gray, of more modern date that adorn our own country ; -yX which, if they have not the same grace, have undoubt¬ edly equal dignity. He. endeavoured to trace this mode of building from the time it commenced through its various changes, till it arrived at its perfection in the reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Eliza¬ beth. For this purpose, he did not so much depend upon written accounts, as that internal evidence which the buildings themselves give of their respective anti¬ quity ; since they constantly furnish to the well-inform¬ ed eye, arms, ornaments, and other marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he applied himself to the study of heraldry as a prepa¬ ratory science j and has left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove him a complete master of it. By these means he arrived at so very extraordinary a pitch of sagacity, as to be en¬ abled to pronounce, at first sight, on the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected. But the favourite study of Mr Gray for the last ten years of his life was natural history, which he then rather resumed than began j as by the instruc¬ tions of his uncle Antrobus, he was a considerable bo¬ tanist at 15. The marginal notes which he has left on Linnaeus and other writers on the vegetable, animal, and fossil kingdoms, are very numerous; but the most considerable are on Hudson’s Flora Anglica, and the tenth edition of the Systema Nature ; which latter he interleaved and filled almost entirely. While employ¬ ed on zoology, he read Aristotle’s treatise on that sub¬ ject with great care, and explained many difficult pas¬ sages of that obscure ancient by the lights he had re¬ ceived from modern naturalists. In a word, excepting pure mathematics, and the studies dependent on that science, there was hardly any part of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill, and in most of them a consummate mastery. To this account of his literary character we may add, that he had a fine taste in painting, prints, gardening, and music j and was moreover a man of good breeding, virtue, and hu¬ manity","Roman, Hudson","RO,US",6,"Romania,United States","Europe,North America"
"He died in 1771 : and an edition of his poems, with memoirs of his life and writings, were published in 4to, in 1775, by Mr Mason. This gentleman, however, instead of employing his own pen in drawing Mr Gray’s character, has adopted one drawn by the reverend Mr Temple, rector of Mamhead in Devonshire, in a letter to Mr Bpswellj to whom the public are indebted for com¬ municating it. “ Perhaps (says Mr Temple) he was the most learned man in Europe. He was equally acquaint¬ ed with the elegant and profound parts of science, and that not superficially but thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both natural and civil y had read all the original historians of England, France, and Italy : and was a great antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics, morals, politics, made a principal part of his plan oi study y voyages and travels of all sorts were his favour¬ ite amusement y and he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and gai'dening. With such a fund of knowledge, his conversation must have been equally instructing and entertaining j but he was also a good man, a well-bred man, a man of virtue and hu¬ manity. There is no character without some speck, some.imperfection j and I think the greatest defect in G R E [ 83 ] G R E , a_ his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather effeminacy, | and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and disdain of C ives. his inferiors in science. He also had, in some degree,   ’ that weakness which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve: though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters; and though without birth, or for¬ tune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who read for his amuse¬ ment. Perhaps it may be said, What signifies so much knowledge, when it produces so little ? Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems? But let it be considered, that Mr Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed ; to him¬ self, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably ; he was every day making some new acquisition in science ; his mind was enlarged, his heart softened, and his virtue strengthened ; the world and mankind were shown to him without a mask ; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and unworthy the at¬ tention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knorv- ledge, and the practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us.” GRAYLING.

"GREAVES, John, an eminent physician and an¬ tiquary, was the eldest son of John Greaves rector of Colemore, near Alresford in Hampshire, and born in 1602. He was educated at Baliol College in Oxford, from which he removed to Merton. He was after¬ wards, on the foot of his great merit, chosen geo¬ metry professor of Gresham college His ardent thirst of knowledge soon carried him into several parts of Greaves Europe, where he eagerly seized every opportunity of II improving it. His next voyage was into the eastern Greece, countries ; where nothing remarkable in the heavens, "" * earth, or ^n subterraneous places, seems to have escaped his nice observation. He, with indefatigable industry, and even at the peril of his life, collected a considerable number of Arabic, Persic, and Greek manuscripts, for Archbishop Laud. Of these he well knew the value, as he was a master of the languages in which they were written. He also collected for that prelate many oriental gems and coins. He took a more accurate survey of the pyramids than any tra¬ veller who went before him.

"Soon after he had finished his second voyage, he was chosen Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford.

His books relating to oriental learning, his Pyramidographia, or a description of the pyramids in Egypt, his Epochce Celebriores, and other curious and useful pieces, of which Mr Ward has given us a catalogue, show him to have been a great man.

"The general names by which the inhabitants of this country were known to the ancients were those of Graioi, or Graicoi, from whence the name of Greece is plainly derived. These names are thought to come from Graecus, the father, or (according to some) the son, of Thessalus, who gave name to Thessaly; but some mo¬ dern critics choose to derive it from Ragau, the same with Peu, the son of Peleg, by the transposition of a letter to soften the sound.—-These names were after¬ wards changed for Achau'and Hellenes; the first, as is supposed from Achceus, the son of Xuthus, the son of Hellen, and father of Ion ; or, according to the fable, the son of Jupiter: the other from Hellen, above men¬ tioned, the son of Deucalion, and father of Dorus, from whom came the Dores, afterwards a famous na¬ tion among the Greeks. Another name by which the Greeks were known in some parts of the country, was that of Pelasgi, which the Arcadians, the most ancient people in Greece, deduced from their pretended foun¬ der Pelasgus, who is said to have got such footing in Peloponnesus, that the whole peninsula from him was called Pelasgia. But the most ancient name of all is universally allowed to have been that of lones, which the Greeks themselves derived from Ion the son of L 2 Xuthus ; G R E [ 84 ] G R E reecc. Xntlius •, or, as the fable hath it, of Apollo, by Cre- usa the daughter of Erichtheus the grandson of Deu¬ calion. Josephus, however, afiirm'*, that their origi¬ nal is of much older date; and that Javan, the son of Japhet, and grandson ot Noah, was the first who peopled these countries ; which Bochart hath also ren¬ dered very probable. It is true, indeed, that among the Greeks themselves, only the Athenians, and such colonies as sprung from them, were called Zones : but it is also plain beyond exception, that other nations sgave this name to all the inhabitants of Greece, The inhabitants of Greece in the first ages, even by the confession of their own historians, appear to have been savages scarce a degree removed from brutes",Jupiter,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"The next advance towards civilization, was their forming themselves into regular societies, to cultivate the lands, and build themselves towns and cities for their safety. Their original barbarity and mutual vio¬ lences against each other naturally prevented them from uniting as one nation, or even into any considerable community : and hence the great number of states in¬ to which Greece wTas originally divided. The most remarkable of these small principalities mentioned in history are the following : In Peloponnesus were those of Sicyon, Argos, and Messenia, Achaia Propria, Arcadia, and Laconia. In Grsecia Propria, (that part of Greece which lay without Peloponnesus,) were those of Attica, Megara, Boeotia, Lucris, Epichne- midia, Doris, Phocis, Locris, Ozolaea, and Ailtolia","Arcadia, Laconia","GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"During this period of savage barbarity, the most renowned Grecian heroes, as Hercules, Theseus, &c, performed their exploits ; which, however exaggera¬ ted by poetic fiction, no doubt had a foundation in truth. Some indeed are of opinion that the Grecian- heroes are entirely fictitious, and their exploits de¬ rived from those of the Hebrew worthies, such as Sam¬ son, Gideon, &c. Yet, considering the extreme de¬ gree of barbarity which at that time prevailed through¬ out Greece, it seems not at all improbable that some persons of extraordinary strength and courage might undertake the cause of the oppressed, and travel about like the more modern knights-errant in quest of adven¬ tures",Hercules,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"The first expedition in which we find the Greeks united, was that against Troy, the particulars of which are recited under the article Troy. Their success here (which happened about 1184 B. C.) cost them very dear ; vast numbers of their bravest warriors be¬ ing slain ; great numbers of the survivors being cast away in their return ; and many of those who had the good luck to get back again being soon after mur¬ dered, or driven out of their country. It is probable, however, that their having staid for such a long time in Asia, might contribute to civilize the Greeks some¬ what sooner than what they otherwise would lia%-e been ; and accordingly, from this time, we find theis history somewhat less obscure, and as it were begin¬ ning to emerge out of darkness. The continual wars, indeed, in which they were engaged among themselves, no doubt, for a long time, prevented them from ma¬ king any considerable advances in those arts in which they afterwards made so great progress. These wars, which G R E L 85 J G R E ,e which indeed never ceased as long as the Greeks pre- w served their liberty, rendered them brave, and skilled in the military art above all other nations j but at the same time they effectually prevented them from making permanent conquests, and confined them within the bounds of their own country j while the different states were one way or other so equally balanced, that scarce one of them was able perfectly to subdue another. The Spartans, however, having with great difficulty, re¬ duced the kingdom of Messene, and added its terri¬ tories to their own, became the leading people in Greece. Their superiority was long disputed by A- thens 5 but the Peloponnesian war at last determined that point in favour of the Spartans, when the city of Athens was taken, and its walls demolished by Ly- sander the Spartan general.

"Modern Greece comprehends Macedonia; Albania, now called Arnaut; Epirus; Thessaly, now Jana; A- chaia, now Livadia; the Peloponnesus, now Morea; together with the islands on its coast, and in the Archi¬ pelago. The continent of Greece is seated betwixt the 36th and 43d degrees of north latitude; and be¬ tween the 19th and 23th degrees of longitude, east of London. To the north, it is bounded by Bulga¬ ria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains ; to the south by the Mediterranean sea ; to the east by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the west by the Adriatic or gulf of Venice. Its length is said to be about 450 miles, and its utmost breadth about 335 miles. The air is extremely tem¬ perate and healthy : and the soil fruitful, though bad¬ ly cultivated ; yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and venison. As to re¬ ligion, Christianity was planted in Greece soon after the death of our Saviour, and flourished there for many ages in great purity; but since the Greeks became subject to the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into the most deplorable ignorance, in consequence of the slavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their re¬ ligion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and absur¬ dities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Constantinople ; who is chosen by the neighbouring archbishops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a person of great dig¬ nity, being the head and director of the eastern church- The G R E [ 86 ] G R E Greece. The other patriarchs are those of Jerusalem, Antioch, —-v——' and Alexandria. Mr Tournefort tells us, that the pa¬ triarchates are now generally set to sale, and bestowed upon those who are the highest bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, are always cho¬ sen from among the Caloyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a vest of linsey-woolsey, or some other stuff, presented by the grand signior to ambassadors, and other persons newly invested with some considerable dignity, they are obliged to make large presents to the vizir, &c. The income of the patriarch of Constantinople is said to amount to no less than one hundred and twenty thou¬ sand guilders, of which he pays the one-half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman Porte, adding six thousand guilders besides as a present at the feast of Bairam. The next person to a bishop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then come the abbot, the arch-priest, the priest, the dea¬ con, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lectu¬ rer. The secular clergy are subjected to no rules, and never rise higher than high-priest. They are allowed to marry once $ but it must be with a virgin, and be¬ fore they are ordained.

"The principal river, called Baal, falls into the sea in Ac«< the 64th degree of latitude, where the first Danish lodge ^ was built in 1721 j and has been navigated above 40 miles up the country. , West Greenland was first peopled by Europeans inPeopWI the eighth century. At that time a company of Ice-aeotaj landers, headed by one Ericke Rande, were by accident^1"" driven on that coast. On his return he represented the1 country in such a favourable light, that some families again followed him thither, where they soon became a thriving colony, and bestowed on their new habitation the name of Greenland or Greenland, on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to Christianity by a missionary from Norway, sent thither by the celebrated Olaf, the first Norwegian monarch who embraced the true religion. The Greenland set¬ tlement continued to increase and thrive under his pro¬ tection j and in a little time the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bishops, &c. un¬ der the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Drontheim. A considerable commerce was carried on between Green¬ land and Norway ; and a regular intercourse maintain¬ ed between the two countries till the year 1406, when j the last bishop was sent over. From that time all cor-AlIc® ^ respondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Green-SP°^(1 tore, land has been buried in oblivion. ,'crt This strange and abrupt cessation of all trade and0g-' ^ intercourse has been attributed to various causes; but the most probable is the following : The colony, from its first settlement, had been harassed by the natives, a barbarous and savage people, agreeing in customs, garb, language, and appearance, with the Esquimaux found about Hudson’s bay. This nation, called Schrellings, at length prevailed against the Iceland settlers who inhabited the western district, and exterminated them ^ in the 14th century : insomuch, that when their brethren cc]0!ii of the eastern district came to their assistance, theyposed found nothing alive but some cattle and flocks of sheepe*tet"" running wild about the country. Perhaps they them-te^‘ selves afterwards experienced the same fate, and were totally destroyed by these Schrellings, whose descend¬ ants still inhabit the western parts of Greenland, and from tradition confirm this conjecture. They affirm that the houses and villages, whose ruins still appear, were inhabited by a nation of strangers, whom their ancestors G R E ancestors destroyed. There are reasons, however, for believing that there may be still some descendants of the ancient Iceland colony remaining in the eastern district, though they cannot be visited by land, on ac¬ count of the stupendous mountains, perpetually cover¬ ed with snow, which divide the two parts of Green¬ land ; while they have been rendered inaccessible by sea, by the vast quantity of ice driven from Spitzber- gen, or East Greenland. One would imagine that there must have been some considerable alteration in the northern parts of the world since the 15th century, so that the coast of Greenland is now become almost to¬ tally inaccessible, though formerly visited with very little difficulty. It is also natural to ask, By what means the people of the eastern colony surmounted the above-mentioned obstacles when they went to the assistance of their western friends $ how they returned to their own country j and in what manner historians learned the success of their expedition P Concerning all this we have very little satisfactory information","Green, Hudson, Green","GL,NO,US,IS",6,"Greenland,Norway,United States,Iceland","North America,Europe,North America,Europe"
"All that can be learned from the most authentic re- t cords is, that Greenland was divided into two districts, called Jrest Bygd and East Bygd: that the western di¬ vision contained four parishes and 100 villages : that the eastern district was still more flourishing, as being nearer to Iceland, sooner settled, and more frequented by shipping from Norway. There are also many ac¬ counts, though most of them romantic and slightly attested, which render it probable that part of the east¬ ern colony still subsists, who, at some time or other, may have given the imperfect relation above mention¬ ed. This colony, in ancient times, certainly compre¬ hended twelve extensive parishes, one hundred and ninety villages, a bishop’s see, and two monasteries",,"GL,IS,NO",6,"Greenland,Iceland,Norway","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The present inhabitants of the western district are en¬ tirely ignorant of this part, from which they are di¬ vided by rocks, mountains, and deserts, and still more effectually by their apprehensions: for they believe the eastern Greenlanders to be a cruel, barbarous nation, that destroy and eat all strangers who fall into their hands. About a century after all intercourse between Norway and Greenland had ceased, several ships were sent successively by the kings of Denmark in order to discover the eastern district; but all of them miscar¬ ried. Among these adventurers, Mogens Heinson, eo after having surmounted many difficulties and dangers, got sight of the land ; which, however, he could not approach. At his return, he pretended that the ship was arrested in the middle of her course by certain rocks of loadstone at the bottom of the sea. The same year, 1576, in which this attempt was made, has been rendered remarkable by the voyage of Cap¬ tain Martin Frobisher, sent upon the same errand by Queen Elizabeth. He likewise descried the land ; but could not reach it, and therefore returned to England ; G R E yet not before he had sailed sixty leagues in the strait which still retains his name, and landed on several islands, where he had some communication with the na¬ tives. He had likewise taken possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth ; and brought away some pieces of heavy black stone, from which the re¬ finers of London extracted a certain proportion of gold",London,"NO,GL,DK,GB",6,"Norway,Greenland,Denmark,United Kingdom","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe"
"Such was the success of this voyage, that another armament was fitted out under the auspices of Admiral Frobisher, consisting of 15 sail, including a considerable number of soldiers, miners, smelters, carpenters, and bakers, to remain all the winter near the mines in a wooden fort, the different pieces of which they carried out in the transports. They met with boisterous wea¬ ther, impenetrable fogs, and violent currents upon the coast of Greenland, which retarded their operations until the season was far advanced. Part of their wooden fort was lost at sea ; and they had neither provision nor fuel sufficient for the winter. The admiral therefore determined to return with as much ore as he could procure : of this they obtained large quantities out of a new mine, to which they gave the name of the Coun¬ tess of Sussex. They likewise built a house of stone and lime, provided with ovens; and here, with a view to conciliate the affection of the natives, they left a quantity of small morrice-bells, knives, beads, look¬ ing glasses, leaden pictures, and other toys, together with several loaves of bread. They buried the timber of the fort where it could be easily found next year ; and sowed corn, pease, and other grain, by way of ex¬ periment, to know what the country would produce",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"Christiern IV, king of Denmark, being desirous of discovering the old Greenland settlement, sent three ships thither, under the command of Captain Godske Lindenow ; who is said to have reached the east coast of Greenland, where he traded with the savage inha¬ bitants, such as they are still found in the western di¬ strict, but saw no signs of a civilized people. Had he actually landed in the eastern division, he must have perceived some remains of the ancient colony, even in the ruins of their convents and villages. Lindenow kidnapped two of the natives, who were conveyed to Copenhagen ; and the same cruel fraud (a) was prac¬ tised C 89 ] (a) Nothing can be more inhuman and repugnant to the dictates of common justice than this practice of tearing away poor creatures from their country, their families, and connections ; unless we suppose them alto- get ler estitute 0 natural affection : and that this was not the case with those poor Greenlanders, some of w 10m roug it alive to Copenhagen, appears from the whole tenor of their conduct, upon their first cap- ure, an unng t icir confinement in Denmark. When first captivated, they rent the air with their cries and amen a 10ns . tiey even leaped into the sea ; and, when taken on board, for some time refused all sustenance, eir ejea were continually turned towards their dear country, and their faces always bathed in tears.

In some places they are said to have found a considerable quantity of ore, every hundred pounds of which yielded twenty-six ounces of silver. The same Admiral Lindenow made another voyage to the coast of Greenland in the year 1606, directing his course to the westward ot Cape Fdrewell. He coasted along the straits of Davis •, and having made some observations on the face of the country, the harbours, and islands, returned to Den¬ mark. Carsten Richards, being detached with two ships on the same discovery, described the high land on the eastern side of Greenlarid •, but was hindered by the ice from approaching the shore","Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Davis, Davis","DK,GL,US",6,"Denmark,Greenland,United States","Europe,North America,North America"
"Other expeditions of the same nature have been plan¬ ned and executed with the same bad success, under the auspices of a Danish company of merchants. Two ships returned from the western part of Greenland loaded with a kind of yellow sand, supposed to con¬ tain a large proportion of gold. This being assayed by the goldsmiths of Copenhagen, was condemned as useless, and thrown overboard ; but from a small quan¬ tity of’this sand, which was reserved as a curiosity, an expert chemist afterwards extracted a quantity of pure gold. The captain, who brought home this ad¬ venture, was so chagrined at his disappointment, that he died of grief, without having left any directions concerning the place where the sand had been disco¬ vered. In the year 1654, Henry Moller, a rich Dane, equipped a vessel under the command of David de Nelles, who sailed to the west coast of Greenland, from which he carried off three women of the country. Other efforts have been made, under the encouragement of the Danish king, for the discovery and recovery of the old Iceland colony in Greenland •, but all of them miscarried, and people began to look upon such expe¬ ditions as wild and chimerical. At length the Green¬ land company at Bergen in Norway, transported a colony to the western coast, about the 64th degree of latitude ; and these Norwegians sailed in the year iyi 2, accompanied by the Reverend Hans Egede, to whose care, ability, and precision, we owe the best and most authentic account of modern Greenland.— This gentleman endeavoured to reach the eastern di¬ strict, by coasting southwards, and advanced as far as the States promontory 5 but the season of the year, and contirtual storms, obliged him to return j and as he could not even find the strait of Frobisher, he con¬ cluded that no Such place ever existed. In the year 1724, a ship, being equipped by the company, sailed on this discovery, with a view to land on the east side try","Copenhagen, David, Green, Bergen","GL,NO,DK,IS,PA,US",6,"Greenland,Norway,Denmark,Iceland,Panama,United States","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,North America,North America"
"impracticable. His Danish majesty, in the year 1728, caused horses to be transported to Greenland, in hope that the settlers might by their means travel over land to the eastern district : but the icy mountains were found impassable. Finally, Lieutenant Richards, in a ship which had wintered near the new Danish colo¬ ny, attempted, in his return to Denmark, to land on the eastern shore j but all his endeavours proved abor¬ tive",,"GL,DK",6,"Greenland,Denmark","North America,Europe"
"That part of the country which is now visited and MtEgsi settled by the Danes and Norwegians, lies between ac<»i the 64th and 68th degrees of north latitude j and thus1 ec® far it is said the climate is temperate. In the sum¬ mer, which continues from the end of May to the middle of September, the weather is warm and com¬ fortable, while the wind blows easterly j though even at this time storms frequently happen, which rage with incredible violence •, and the sea-coasts are infested with fogs that are equally disagreeable and unhealthy.— Near the shore, and in the bays and inlets, the low land is clothed with the most charming verdure } but the inland mountains are perpetually covered with ice and snow. To the northward of the 68th degree of latitude the cold is prodigiously intense ; and towai’ds the end 6f August all the coast is covered with ice, which never‘thaws till April or May, and sometimes not till the1 latter end of June. Nothing can exhibit a tnore dreadful, and at the same time a more dazzling, appearance, than those prodigious masses of ice that surround the iVhole coast in various forms, reflecting a multitude of colours from the sun-beams, and calling to mind the enchanted scenes of romance. Such pro¬ spects they yield in calm weather j but when the wind begins to blow, and the waves to rise in vast billows, the violent shocks of those pieces of ice dashing against one another, fill the mind with horror.—Greenland is seldom visited with thunder and lightning, but the Au¬ rora Borealis is very frequent and bright. At the time of new and full moon, the tide rises and falls upon this coast the countenance of his Danish majesty, and the caresses of the court and people, could not alleviate their grief",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"One of them was perceived to shed tears always when he saw an infant in the mother’s arms ; a circumstance from whence it was naturally concluded, that he had left his wife with a young child in Greenland. Two of them went to sea in their little canoes in hope of reaching Greenland j but one of them was retaken. Other two made the same attempt: but were driven by a storm on the coast of Schonen, where they were apprehend¬ ed by the peasants, and reconveyed to Copenhagen. One of them afterwards died of a fever, caught in fishing pearl, during the winter, for the governor of Kolding. The rest lived some years in Denmark j but at length, seeing no prospect of being able to revisit their native country, they sunk into a kind of melancholy disorder, *nd expired","Copenhagen, Kolding","DK,GL",6,"Denmark,Greenland","Europe,North America"
"The soil of Greenland varies like that of all other mountainous countries. The hills are very barren, being indeed frozen throughout the whole year ; but the valleys and low grounds, especially near the sea, are rich and fruitful. The ancient Norwegian chro¬ nicles inform us, that Greenland formerly produced a great number of cattle 5 and that considerable quanti¬ ties of butter and cheese were exported to Norway ; and, on account of their peculiar excellency, set apart for the king’s use. The same histories inform us, that some parts of the country yielded excellent wheat ; and that large oaks were found here, which earned acorns as big as apples. Some ot these oaks stul remain in the southern parts, and in many places the marks of ploughed land are easily perceived. At present, however, the country is destitute of corn and cattle, though in many places it produces excellent pasture ; and, if properly cultivated, would probably yield grain also. Mr Egede sowed some barley in a bay adjoin- ! 1 ing to the Danish colony. It sprang up so fast, that by the latter end of July it was in the full ear j but being nipped by a night-frost, it never arrived at ma¬ turity. This seed was brought from Bergen, where the summer is of greater heat and duration than in Greenland; but in all probability the corn which grows in the northern parts of Norway would also thrive here. Turnips and coleworts of an excellent taste and flavour are also produced here. The sides of the mountains near the bays are clothed with wild thyme, which diffuses its fragrance to a great distance",Bergen,"NO,GL",6,"Norway,Greenland","Europe,North America"
"The herb tormentil is very common in this country, and likewise many others not described by the bota¬ nists. Among the fruits of Greenland we number juniper-berries, blue-berries, bil-berries, and bramble- berries",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"Greenland is thought to contain many mines of me¬ tal, though none of them are wrought. To the south¬ ward of the Danish colony are some appearances of a mine of copper. Mr Egede once received a lump of ore from one of the natives ; and here he found cala¬ mine of a yellow colour. He once sent a considerable quantity of sand of a yellow colour, intermixed with streaks of vermilion, to the Bergen company. They probably found their account in this present; for they desired him by a letter to procure as much of that sand as possible : but he was never able to find the place were he saw the first specimen. It was one of the smallest among a great number of islands ; and the mark he had set up was blown down by a violent storm. Possibly this might be the same mineral of which Captain Frobisher brought so much to England",Bergen,"GL,NO",6,"Greenland,Norway","North America,Europe"
"This country produces rock-crystals both red and white, and whole mountains of the asbestos or incom¬ bustible flax. Around the colony, which is known by the name of Good Hope, they find a kind of bastard marble of various colours, which the natives form into bowls, lamps, pots, &c. All that has been said of the fertility of Greenland, however, must be under¬ stood only ol that part which lies between the 60th and 65th degrees of latitude. The most northern parts are totally destitute of herbs and plants. The wretched inhabitants cannot find grass in sufficient quantities to stuff1 into their shoes to keep their feet warm, but are Greenland, obliged to buy it from those who inhabit the more >—y—* southern parts",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"The animals which abound most in Greenland are, rein-deer, foxes, hares, dogs, and white bears. The hares are of a white colour, and very fat; the foxes are of different colours, white, grayish, and bluish ; and smaller than those of Denmark and Norway. The natives keep a great number of dogs, which are large, white, or speckled, and rough, with ears standing up¬ right, as is the case with all the dogs peculiar to cold climates. They are timorous and stupid ; and neither bay nor bark, but sometimes howl dismally. In the northern parts the natives yoke them in sledges; which, though heavy laden, they will draw on the ice at the rate of 70 miles in a short winter’s day. These poor animals are very ill rewarded for their service ; being left to provide for themselves, except when their masters happen to catch a great number of seals. On these occasions the dogs are regaled with the blood and entrails ; at other times they subsist, like wild beasts, upon muscles and berries. Here also are found great numbers of ravens, eagles of a prodigious size, falcons, and other birds of prey ; and likewise a kind of linnet, which warbles very melodiously. Whales, sword-fish, porpoises, &c. abound on the coasts ; also holybut, turbot, cod, haddock, &c. S The people who now inhabit the western coasts of Account of Greenland, and who, without doubt, are the descend-' dants of the ancient Schrcitings, who exterminated the first Iceland colony, bear a near resemblance to the Samoiedesand Laplanders in their persons, complexions, and way of life. They are short, brawny, and inclined to corpulency ; with broad faces, flat noses, thick lips, black hair and eyes, and a yellowish tawny com¬ plexion. They are for the most part vigorous and healthy; but remarkably short-lived; few of them reaching the grand climacteric ; and many dying in their infancy, and in the prime of youth. They are subject to a weakness in the eyes, occasioned by the piercing winds and the glare of the snow in the winter time. The leprosy is known among them, but is not contagious. Those that dwell in the northern parts are miserably tormented with dysenteries, rheums, and pulmonary disorders, boils, and epilepsy. The small¬ pox being imported among them from Copenhagen in the year I734> nia(le terrible havock among these poor people, who are utterly destitute of any knowledge of the medicinal art, and depend entirely for assistance upon their angekuts or conjurers. In their dispositions the Greenlanders are cold, phlegmatic, indolent, and slow of apprehension : but very quiet, orderly, and good-natured. They live peaceably together; and have every thing in common, without strife, envying, or animosity. They are civil and hospitable, but slo¬ venly to a degree almost beyond the Hottentots them¬ selves. They never wash themselves with water ; but lick their paws like the cat, and then rub their faces with them. They eat after their dogs without wash¬ ing their dishes; devour the lice which devour them; and even lick the sweat, which they scrape off"" from their faces with their knives. The women wash them¬ selves with their own urine, which they imagine makes their hair grow; and in the winter-time go out imme¬ diately after, to let the liquor freeze upon their skin",Copenhagen,"GL,DK,NO,IS",6,"Greenland,Denmark,Norway,Iceland","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"

In times of scar¬ city they will subsist on pieces of old skin, reeds, sea¬ weed, and a root called tugloronet, dressed with train- oil and fat. The dung of rein deer taken from the intestines, the entrails of partridges, and all sorts of of- fals, are counted dainties among these savages j and of the scrapings of seal skins they make delicate pan-cakes",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"The letters C, D, F, Q, and X, are not known in their alphabet. Like the North Americans, and in¬ habitants of Kamtschatka, they have a great number of long polysyllables. Their words, nouns as well as verbs, are inflected at the end by varying the termi¬ nation, without the help of articles : but their lan¬ guage being found defective, they have adopted a good many words from the Norwegian dialect. Notwith¬ standing the endeavours of the Danish missionaries, they have no great reason to boast of the proselytes they have made of the natives of Greenland. These savages pay great deference and respect to the Danes, whom indeed they obey as their masters, and hear the truths of the Christian religion expounded with¬ out doubting the veracity of their teachers *, but at the same time they listen with the most mortifying in¬ difference, without being in the least influenced by what they have heard. They believe in the immor¬ tality of the soul, and the existence of a spirit whom they call Tomgai'SJtk; but of whom they have form¬ ed the most ridiculous notions. The angekuts, who are supposed to ba his immediate ministers, differ con¬ cerning the principles of his existence ; some affirming Grecniamj that he is without form or shape ; others, that he has the shape of a bear j others, that he has a large human body with only one arm *, while others affirm that he is no larger than a man’s finger, with many other absur¬ dities of a similar kind. They have also a peculiar kind of mythology, by which they believe all the ele¬ ments to be full of spirits, from among which every one of their prophets is supplied with a familiar which they name Torngack, and who is always ready when sum¬ moned to his assistance",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"When they find a whale, they strike him with har¬ poons, to which are fastened with long lines some seal skins blown up like bladders. These, by floating on the surface, not only discover the back of the whale, hut hinder him from diving under water for any length of time. They continue to pursue him until he loses strength, when they pierce him with spears and lances till he expires. On this occasion they are clad in their spring coats, consisting of one piece, with gloves, boots, caps made of seal-skin so closely laced and sew¬ ed that they keep out water. Thus accoutred, they leap into the sea; and begin to slice off the fat, even under water, before the whale is dead.—They have many different ways of killing seals ; namely, by strik¬ ing them with a small harpoon equipped also with an air-bag; by watching them when they come to breathe at the air-holes in the ice, and striking them with spears; by approaching them in the disguise of their own species, that is, covered with a seal-skin, creep¬ ing upon the ice, and moving the head from side to side as the seals are accustomed to do. By this stra¬ tagem the Greenlander moves towards the unsus¬ pecting seal, and kills him with a spear. The Greenlanders angle with lines made of whale-bone cut very small, by means of which they succeed wonderfully. The Greenland canoe, like that used in Nova Zembla and Hudson’s bav, is about three fathoms in length, pointed at both ends, and three quarters of a yard in breadth. It is composed of thin rafts fastened together with the sinews of ani¬ mals. It is covered with dressed seal-skins both be¬ low and above, in such a manner that only a circular hole is left in the middle, large enough to admit the body of one man. Into this the Greenlander thrusts himself up to the waist, and fastens the skin so tight about G R E l 93 1 G R E tn(Ji about litm that no water can enter. Thus secured, mmj and armed with a paddle broad at both ends, he will venture out to sea in the most stormy weather to catch seals and sea-fowl ; and if he is overset, he can easily raise himself by means of his paddle. A Green¬ lander in one of these canoes, which vras brought with him to Copenhagen, outstripped a pinnace of 16 oars, manned with choice mariners.—The kone- boat is made of the same materials, but more durable $ and so large, that it will contain 50 persons with all their tackle, baggage, and provisions. She is fitted with a mast, which carries a triangular sail made of the membranes and entrails of seals, and is managed without the help of braces and bowlings. These kones are flat bottomed, and sometimes 60 feet in length. 'Hie men think it beneath them to take charge of them j and therefore they are left to the conduct of the women, who indeed are obliged to do ail the drudgery, including even the building and re¬ pairing their houses, while the men employ themselves wholly in preparing their hunting implements and fish¬ ing tackle","Hudson, Green, Copenhagen","US,DK",6,"United States,Denmark","North America,Europe"
"The number of inhabitants In West Greenland in 1802 was estimated at 20,000. In the winter time the people dwell in huts built of stone or turf: on the one side are the windows, covered with the skins of seals or rein-deer. Several families live in one of these houses, possessing each a separate apartment, before which is a hearth with a great lamp placed on a trevit, over which hangs their kettle 5 above is a rack or shelf on which their wet clothes are dried. They burn train oil in their lamps ; and instead of wick, they use a kind of moss, which fully answers the purpose. These fires are not only sufficient to boil their victuals ; but like¬ wise to produce such a heat, that the whole house is like a bagnio. The door is very low, that as little cold air as possible may be admitted. The house within is lined with old skins, and surrounded with benches for the conveniency of strangers. In the summer time they dwell in tents made of long poles fixed in a conical form, covered in the inside with deer skins, and on the outside with seal skins, dressed so that the rain cannot pierce them",,GL,6,Greenland,North America
"ten- East Greenland was for a long time considered as a part of the continent of West Greenland, hut is now discovered to he an assemblage of islands lying betrveen 76° 46' and 8o° 30' of north latitude, and between 90 and 20° of east longitude. It was discovered by Sir Hugh Willoughby in the year 1553, who called it Greenland; supposing it to he a part of the western continent. In 1595, it was again visited by William Barentz and John Cornelius, two Dutchmen, who pre¬ tended to be the original discoverers, and called the country Spitsbergen^ or Sharp Mountains, from the many sharp-pointed and rocky mountains with which it abounds. They alleged that the coast discovered by Sir Hugh Willoughby was some other country ; which accordingly the Hollanders delineated on their maps and charts by the name of Willoughby Land; whereas in fact no such land ever existed \ and long before the voyage of these Dutchmen, Stephen Bar- rows, an English shipmaster, had coasted along a deso¬ late country from N.

"In 1638, M. Poincy, a Frenchman, attempted to make a settlement in Grenada ; but was driven off by the Caribbeans, who resorted to this island in greater numbers than to the neighbouring ones, probably on account of the game with which it abounded. In 1650, Mons. Parquet, governor of Martinico, carried over from that island 200 men, furnished with presents to reconcile the savages to them ; but with arms to sub¬ due them, in case they should prove intractable. The savages are said to have been frightened into submis¬ sion by the number of the Frenchmen : but, according to some French writers, the chief not only welcomed the new-comers; but, in consideration of some knives, hatchets, scissars, and other toys, yielded to Parquet the sovereignty of the island, reserving to themselves their own habitations. The Abbe Raynal informs us, that these first French colonists, imagining they had purchased the island by these trifles, assumed the sove¬ reignty, and soon acted as tyrants. The Caribs, un¬ able to contend with them by force, took their usual method of murdering all those whom they found in a defenceless state. This produced a war ; and the French settlers having received a reinforcement of 300 men from Martinico, forced the savages to retire to a mountain ; from whence, after exhausting all their ar¬ rows, they rolled down great logs of wood on their enemies. Here they were joined by other savages from the neighbouring islands, and again attacked the French, but were defeated anew ; and were at last dri¬ ven to such desperation, that 40 of them, who had esca¬ ped from the slaughter, jumped from a precipice into the sea, where they all perished, rather than fall into the hands of their implacable enemies. From thence the rock was called le morne des sauteurs, or “ the hill of the leapers which name it still retains. The French then destroyed the habitations and all the pro¬ visions of the savages ; but fresh supplies of Carib¬ beans arriving, the war was renewed with great vigour, and great numbers of the French were killed. Upon this they resolved totally to exterminate the natives: and having according attacked the savages unawares, they inhumanly put to death the women and children, as well as the men; burning all their boats and ca¬ noes, to cut oft’ all communication between the few survivors and the neighbouring islands. Notwithstand¬ ing all these barbarous precautions, however, the Ca¬ ribbees proved the irreconcileable enemies of theFrench; and their frequent insurrections at last obliged Par* quet to sell all his property in the island to the Count de Cerillac in 1657. new proprietor, who pur¬ chased Parquet’s property for 30,000 crowns, sent thither a person of brutal manners to govern the island. He behaved with such insupportable tyranny, that most of the colonists retired to Martinico ; and the few who remained condemned him to death af¬ ter a formal trial. In the whole court of justice that tried this miscreant, there was only one man (called Archangcli') who could write. A farrier was the per¬ son who impeached : and he, instead of the signatures, sealed with a horse-shoe ; and Archangeli, who per¬ formed to¬ wn ORE [ 103 ] GEE formed the office of clerk, wrote round it these words in French, “ Mark of M. de la Brie, counsel for the court.” It was apprehended that the court of i ranee wouki not ratify a sentence passed with such unusual formali¬ ties $ and therefore most of the judges of the governor’s crimes, and witnesses of his execution, disappeared",Mons,"FR,GD,BE",6,"France,Grenada,Belgium","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Only those remained whose obscurity screened them from the pursuit of the laws. By an estimate, taken in 1700, there were at Grenada no more than 251 white people, 53 free savages or mulattoes, and 525 slaves. The useful animals were reduced to 64 horses and 569 head of horned cattle. The whole culture consisted of three plantations of sugar and 52 of in¬ digo.—The island had been sold in 1664 to the French West India company for 100,000 livres",,"GD,FR",6,"Grenada,France","North America,Europe"
"This unfavourable state of the affairs of Grenada was changed in 1714. The change was owing to the flourishing condition of Martinico. The richest of the ships from that island were sent to the Spanish coasts, and in their way touched at Grenada to take in refreshments. The trading privateers, who under¬ took this navigation, taught the people of that island the value of their soil, which only required cultivation",,"GD,ES",6,"Grenada,Spain","North America,Europe"
"Some traders furnished the inhabitants with staves and utensils to erect sugar plantations. An open account was established between the two colonies. Grenada was clearing its debts gradually by its rich produce $ and the balance was on the point of being closed, when the war in 1744 interrupted the communication between the two islands, and at the same time stopped the progress of the sugar-plantations. This loss was supplied by the culture of coffee, which was pursued during the hostilities with all the activity and eager¬ ness that industry could inspire.—The peace of 1 748 revived all the labours, and opened all the former sour¬ ces of wealth. In 1753, the population of Grenada consisted of 1262 white people, 175 free negroes, and 11,991 slaves. The cattle amounted to 2298 horses or mules, 2456 head of horned cattle, 3278 sheep, 902 goats, and 331 hogs. The cultivation rose to 83 sugar plantations, 2,725,600 coffee trees, 150,300 cocoa-trees, and 800 cotton plants. The provisions consisted of 5,740,450 trenches of cassada, 933,596 banana trees, and 143 squares of potatoes and yams. The colony made a rapid progress, in proportion to the excellence of its soil; but in 1762 the island was taken by the British. At this time one of the mountains at the side of St George’s har¬ bour was strongly fortified, and might have made a good defence, but surrendered without firing a gun ; and by the treaty concluded in 1763 the island was ceded to Britain. On this cession, and the manage¬ ment of the colony after that event, the abbe Raynal has the following remarks.—“ This long train of evils [the ambition and mismanagement of his countrymenJ has thrown Grenada into the hands of the English, who are in possession of this conquest by the treaty of 1763* But how long will they keep this colony? Or, will it never again be restored to France ?—Eng¬ land has not made a fortunate beginning. In the first enthusiasm raised by an acquisition, of which the highest opinion had been previously formed, every one was eager to purchase estates there. They sold for much more than their real value. This caprice, by expelling old colonists who were inured to the cli¬ mate, has sent about 1,553,000!. out of the mother- country. This imprudence has been followed by ano¬ ther. The new proprietors, misled, no doubt, by na¬ tional pride, have substituted new methods to those of their predecessors. They have attempted to alter the mode of living among their slaves. The negroes, who from their very ignorance are more attached to their customs than other men, have revolted. It hath been found necessary to send out troops, and to shed blood",,"GD,FR,GB,UK",6,"Grenada,France,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"The island flourished from the liberty that was enjoyed there. The inhabitants collected about I2C0 slaves, by whose labours they made themselves a revenue of near 20,oool. a-year in cotton.—The other Grenadines do not afford a prospect of the same advantages, though the plantation of sugar is begun there. It has succeed¬ ed remarkably well at Becouya, the largest and most fertile of these islands, which is no more than two leagues distant from St Vincent.” In the year 1779, the conquest of this island was accomplished by D’Estaign the French admiral, who had been prevented from attempting it before by his enterprise against St Vincent. Immediately after his conquest of St Lucia, however, being reinforced by a squadron under M. de laMotte, he set sail for Grenada with a fleet of 26 sail of the line and 1 2 frigates, ha¬ ving on board 10,000 laud forces. Here he arrived on the second of July; and landed 3000 troops, chiefly Irish, being part of the brigade composed of natives of Ireland in the service of France. These were con¬ ducted by Count Dillon, who disposed them in such a manner as to surround the bill that overlooks and commands George’s town, together with the fort and harbour. To oppose these, Lord M‘Cartney, the governor, had only about 150 regulars, and 300 or 400 armed inhabitants ; but though all resistance was evidently vain, he determined nevertheless to make an honourable and gallant defence. The preparations be made were such as induced D’Estaign himself to be present at the attack ; and, even with his vast superiori¬ ty of force, the first attack on the entrenchments proved unsuccessful",George,"IE,FR,GD,ZA",6,"Ireland,France,Grenada,South Africa","Europe,Europe,North America,Africa"

"In the mean time Admiral Byron, who had been convoying the homeward-bound West India fleet, ha¬ stened to St Vincent, in hopes of recovering it ; but being informed, by the way, that a descent had been made at Grenada, he changed his course, hoping that JLord M‘Cartney would be able to hold out till his ar¬ rival. On the sixth of July he came in sight of the French fleet *, and, without regarding D’Estaign’s su¬ periority of six ships of the line and as many frigates, determined if possible to force him to a close engage¬ ment. The French commander, however, was not so confident of his own prowess as to run the risk of an encounter of this kind •, and having already at- chieved his conquest, had no other view than to pre¬ serve it. His designs were facilitated by the good condition of his fleet; which being more lately come out of port than that of the British, sailed faster, so that he was thus enabled to keep at what distance he pleased. The engagement began about eight in the morning, when Admiral Barrington with his own and two other ships got up to the van of the enemy, which they attacked with the greatest spirit. As the other ships of his division, however, were not able to get up to his assistance, these three ships were necessarily obliged to encounter a vast superiority, and of consequence suf¬ fered exceedingly. The battle was carried on from be¬ ginning to end in the same unequal manner j nor were the British commanders, though they used their utmost efforts for this purpose, able to bring the French to a close engagement. Thus Captains Collingwood, Ed¬ wards, and Cornwallis, stood the fire of the whole French fleet for some time. Captain Fanshavv of the Monmouth, a 64 gun ship, threw himself singly in the way of the enemy’s van j and Admiral Ilowley and Captain Butchart fought at the same disadvantage: so that finding it impossible to continue the engagement with any probability of success, a general cessation of firing took place about noen. It recommenced in the same manner about two in the afternoon ; and lasted, with different interruptions,'till the evening. During this action some of the British ships had forced their way into St George’s harbour, not imagining that the enemy were already in possession of the island",Collingwood,"FR,GB,GD,CA",6,"France,United Kingdom,Grenada,Canada","Europe,Europe,North America,North America"

"As the French troops had been too successful in their attack upon Guadaloupe, the disaffected negroes in Grenada who spoke the French language, as well as numbers of white people who were charmed with the extravagant doctrine of liberty and equality, were en¬ couraged to project and execute a revolt from the Bri¬ tish government, every step of which they marked with plunder and with blood. Having effected a landing at Grenville or La Baye, and Charlotte town, on different sides of the island, the insurgents, to the number of too, surrounded the former place, and about one o’clock in the morning (March 6. 1795) plundered the dwelling and storehouses, and dragging the innocent, the astonish¬ ed inhabitants into the streets, set them up as marks to be shot at. When they fell before the discharge of their musketry, the inhuman banditti mangled their bodies with cutlasses in the most shocking manner. At this time there were 14 English inhabitants in the town, only three of whom escaped the insatiable ven¬ geance of those pretended lovers of freedom !

It was at this time he thought proper to provide himself with a mansion-house in the city, suitable to his station and dignity ; with which intention he built a large house on the west side of Bishopsgate-street, afterwards known by the name of Gresham-college. His father had proposed building a house or exchange for the merchants to meet in, in¬ stead of walking in the open street ; but this design remained for the son to accomplish.

"In the year 1581, when the French commissioners who came to treat about the queen’s marriage with the duke of Anjou were sumptuously entertained with tilts and tournaments, Mr Greville, who was one ot the challengers, so signalized himself, as to “ win the reputation of a most valiant knight.” He continued a constant attendant at court, and a favourite with the queen to the end of her reign •, during which he ob¬ tained the office of treasurer of marine causes, also a grant of the manor of Wedgnock, and likewise the honour of knighthood.

This fellow’s name was Haywood j and the cause is said to have been a severe reprimand for his presumption in upbraiding his master for not providing for him after his death. It seems he had been witness to Lord Brook’s will, and knew the con¬ tents. Some say he stabbed him with a knife in the back, others with a sword.

Ta obtain this end, no other remedy was judged sufficient but a change in the succession of the crown, and transferring it into their own families, by rendering Lady Jane queen. Those most excellent and amiable qualities which had rendered her dear to all who had the happiness to know her, joined to her near affinity to the king, subjected her to become the chief tool of an ambition so notoriously not her own.

"His reputation reached Cardinal Mazarine at Paris, who sent for him, settled a large pension on him, and employed him for three years in embellishing his palace and the Louvre, by the order of Louis XIII. The troubles of the state, and the clamours raised against the cardinal, whose party he warmly espoused, put him so much in danger, that his friends advised him to re¬ tire among the Jesuits. He did so, and was of use to them j for he painted them a decoration for the exposi¬ tion of the sacrament during the holy days, according to the custom of Rome. This piece was mightily relish¬ ed at Paris : the king honoured it with two visits, and commanded him to paint such another for his chapel at the Louvre.

"Grimaldi was amiable in his manners, as well as skilful in his profession : he was generous without profusion, respectful to the great without meanness, and chari¬ table to the poor. The following instance of his bene¬ volence may serve to characterize the man. A Sicilian gentleman, who had retired from Messina with his daughter during the troubles of that country, was re¬ duced to the misery of wanting bread. As he lived over-against him, Grimaldi was soon informed of it •, and in the dusk of the evening, knocking at the Sici¬ lian’s door, without making himself known, tossed in money and retired. The thing happening more than once, raised the Sicilian’s curiosity to know his bene¬ factor *, who finding him out, by hiding himself behind the door, fell down on his knees to thank the hand that had relieved him. Grimaldi remained confused, offered him his house, and continued his friend till his death. He died of a dropsy at Rome in 1680, and left a considerable fortune among six children. The genius of Grimaldi directed him chiefly to landscape, which he executed most happily. His colouring is strongs his touch light and delicate j his situations are uncom¬ monly pleasing; and the leafing of his trees is admi¬ rable. Sometimes, indeed, his colouring G E I ig appears ra- IC8 ] ther too green : but those landscapes, which he painted Grimaif in the manner of Caracci, may serve as models for all |) those who admire the style of that school ; and he de- signed his figures in an elegant taste.

"GRISONS, a people situated among the Alps, and allies of the Swiss. Their country is bounded on the north G R I [ Grifon*. north by the countries of Surgans and Bludenz v—' canton of Claris, and the principality of Lichtenstein 5 on the south by the canton’s Italian bailhvics, the county of Chavenne, and the Valteline : on the east by the territories of Venice and Milan ; and on the west by some of the Italian bailiwics, and the canton of Uri. It is divided into three leagues, viz. the Grison or grey league, the league of the house oj God, and that of the ten jurisdictions ; which unite and term one republic. The two first lie towards the south, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above 70 miles, and the breath about 60. The in¬ habitants are said to have had the name of Orisons from the grey coats they wore in former times. This coun¬ try, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous ; but the mountains yield good pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats, with some rye and barley : in the valleys there is plenty of grain, pulse, fruits, and wine. This coun¬ try also abounds with hogs and wild-fowl } but there is a scarcity of fish and salt, and their horses are mostly purchased of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are also several lakes, most of which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Grisons is either a corrupt Italian or the German. Each of the leagues is subdivided into several lesser communities, which are so many demo¬ cracies ; every male above 16 having a share in the go¬ vernment of the community, and a vote in the election of magistrates. Deputies from the several communi¬ ties constitute the general diet of the Grison leagues, which meets annually, and alternately at the capital of each league ; but they can conclude nothing without the consent of their constituents. This country was anciently a part of Rhetia. After the extinction of the Roman empire in the west, it w,as some time sub¬ ject to its own dukes, or those of Swabia. Then the bishop of Coire, and other petty princes, dependent on the emperors of Germany, became masters of great part of it: at last, by the extinction of some, pur¬ chase, voluntary grants, and force, it got rid of all its lords, and erected itself into three distinct republics, each of which, as we observed already, is subdivided into a certain number of communities, which are a sort of republics, exercising every branch of sovereignty, except that of making peace or war, sending embassies, concluding alliances, and enacting laws relating to the whole country, which belong to the provincial diets of the several leagues. The communities may be compa¬ red to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the seve¬ ral leagues to the provincial states. The particular diets are composed of a deputy from each community ; and both in them and the communities every thing is deter¬ mined by a majority of votes. In the communities, every male above 16 has a vote. Besides the annual provincial diets for choosing the chiefs and other offi¬ cers, and deliberating on the affairs of the respective leagues, there are general diets for what concerns all the three leagues or whole body. In both these, the representatives can do nothing of themselves, but are tied down to the instructions of their principals","Venice, Roman, Holland","IT,DE,US,RO,SZ",6,"Italy,Germany,United States,Romania,Eswatini","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe,Africa"

In 1613 he settled in Rotterdam, and was nominated syndic of that city ; but did not accept of the office till a pro¬ mise ivas made him that he should not be removed from it. This prudent precaution he took from his foreseeing, that the quarrels of the divines on the doc¬ trine of grace, which had alieady given rise to many factions in the state, would occasion revolutions in the chief cities.

On his return to Holland, his attachment to Barnevelt in¬ volved him in great trouble ; for he was seized, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in 1619, and to forfeit all his goods and chattels. But after having been treated with great rigour for above a year and a half in his confinement, he was delivered by the advice and artifice of his wife, who having observed that his keepers had often fatigued themselves with searching and exa¬ mining a great trunk full of foul linen which used to be washed at Gorkum, but now let to pass without open¬ ing it, she advised him to bore holes in it to prevent his being stilled, and then to get into it. He complied with this advice, and was carried to a friend’s house in Gorkum ; where dressing himself like a mason, and taking a rule and trowel, he passed through the market¬ place, and stepping into a boat went to Valvet in Brabant. Here he made himself known to some Ar¬ minians, and hired a carriage to Antwerp. At first there was a design of prosecuting his wife, who staid in the prison; and some judges were of opinion that she ought to be kept there in her husband’s stead : how¬ ever, she was released by a plurality of voices, and uni¬ versally applauded for her behaviour.

After having discharged the du¬ ties ot this office above eleven years, he returned in order to give an account to Queen Christina of his embassy ; when he took Holland in his way, and re¬ ceived many honours at Amsterdam.

Here his ardent love of learning, and admi¬ rable capacity for acquiring it, soon appeared, and procured him many patrons, by whose assistance he was enabled to prosecute his studies, first at Cambridge, afterwards at Oxford, and at last at Paris. In these three famous seats of learning, he spent many years in the most indefatigable pursuit of knowledge, and be¬ came one of the best and most universal scholars of the age. He was a great master not only of the French and Latin, but also of the Greek and Hebrew lan¬ guages, which was a very rare accomplishment in those times. We are assured by Roger Bacon, who was inti¬ mately acquainted with him, that he spent much of his time for almost forty years in the study of geometry, astronomy, optics, and other branches of physical and mathematical learning, in all which he very much ex¬ celled.

"of Lincoln. But that brave and virtous prelate » '^ boldly refused to obey this unreasonable mandate, and sent an answer to the papal bull containing the follow¬ ing severe reproaches against his holiness for abusing his power : “ If we except the sins of Lucifer and Antichrist, there neither is nor can be a greater crime, nor any thing more contrary to the doctrine of the gospel, or more odious and abominable in the sight of Jesus Christ, than to ruin and destroy the souls of men, by depriving them of the spiritual aid and ministry of their pastors. This crime is committed by those who command the benefices intended for the support of able pastors, to be bestowed on those who are incapable of performing the duties of the pastoral office. It is im¬ possible therefore that the holy apostolic see, which received its authority from the Lord Jesus Christ, tor edification, and not for destruction, can be guilty of such a crime, or any thing approaching to such a crime, so hateful to God and so hurtful to men. For this would be a most manifest corruption and abuse of- its authority, which would forfeit all its glory, and plunge it into the pains of hell.” Upon hearing this letter, his holiness became frantic with rage, poured forth a torrent of abuse against the good bishop, and threatened to make him an object of terror and asto¬ nishment to the whole world. “ How dare (said he) this old, deaf, doating fool, disobey my commands ? Is not his master the king of England my subject, or rather my slave ? Cannot he cast him into prison, and crush him in a moment ?” But the cardinals by degrees brought the pope to think more calmly, and to take no notice of this letter. “ Let us not (said they) raise a tumult in the church without necessity, and precipitate that revolt and separation from us, which we know must one day take place.” Remarkable words, when we reflect when and by whom they wei« spoken 1 The bishop did not long survive this noble stand against the gross corruptions and tyranny of the church of Rome P for*he fell sick at his castle of Bug- den that same year ; and when he became sensible that his death was drawing near, he called his clergy into his apartment, and made a long discourse to them, to prove that the reigning pope Innocent IV. was An¬ tichrist.

"In the year 1008, and during the two following centu¬ ries, it was thrice reduced by famine.

"GUILD, (from the Saxon guildane, to “ pay”), sig¬ nifies a fraternity or company, because every one was gildare, i. e. to pay something towards the charge and support of the company. As to the original of £ O ] GUI these guilds or companies : It was a law among the Saxons, that every freeman of fourteen years of age Guilds should find sureties to keep the peace, or be commit-'— ted : upon which certain neighbours, consisting of ten families, enter into an association, and become bound for each other, either to produce him who committed an oflence, or to make satisfaction to the injured par¬ ty' ; that they might the better do this, they raised a sum of money among themselves, which they put into a common stock-, and when one of their pledges had committed an offence, and was fled, then the other nine made satisfaction out of this stock, by payment of mo¬ ney, according to the offence. Because tins association consisted ol ten families, it was called a dccennung . and from hence came out later kinds of fraternities.. But as to the precise time when these guilds had their ori¬ gin in England, there is nothing of certainty to be found ; since they were in use long before any formal licence was granted to them for such meetings.

"th.e higher ground planted with millet, Indian corn, and pease of different sorts j their beef excellent j poultry plenty and very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.” Mr Moore, who was sent from England about the year 1735, in the service of the African company, and resided at Janies Fort on the river Gambia, or in other factories on that river, about five years, confirms the above account of the fruitful¬ ness of the country. Captain Smith, who was sent in the year 1726 by the African company to survey their settlements throughout the whole coast of Guinea, * Voyage says *> “ th0 country about the Gambia is pleasant and to Guinea, fruitful j provisions of all kinds being plenty and ex- p. 31, 34. ceeding cheap.” The country on and between the two above-mentioned rivers is large and extensive, in¬ habited principally by those three Negro nations known by the name of Jalqfs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalofs possess the middle of the country. The Fulis principal settlement is on both sides of the Senegal : great numbers of these people are also mixed with the Mandingos j which last are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia. The government of the Jalofs is represented as under a better regulation than can be expected from the common opinion we entertain of the negroes. We are told in Astley’s Collection, “That the king has under him several ministers of state, who assist him in the exercise of justice. The grand jerafo is the chief justice through all the king’s dominions, and goes in circuit from time to time to hear complaints and determine controversies. The king’s treasurer exercises the same employment, and has under him alkairs, who are governors of towns or villages. That the kondi, or viceroy, goes the cir¬ cuit with the chief justice, both to hear causes and in¬ spect into the behaviour of the alkadi, or chief ma¬ gistrate of every village in their several districts.” Vas- concelas, an author mentioned in the Collection, says, “ the ancientest are preferred to be the prince’s coun¬ sellors, who keep always about his person ; and the men of most judgment and experience are the judges.” The Fulis are settled on both sides of the river Senegal: their country, which is very fruitful and populous, extends near 400 miles from east to west. They are generally of a deep tawney complexion, appearing to bear some affinity to the Moors, whose country they join on the north : they are good farmers, and make great harvest of corn, cotton, tobacco, &c. and breed great numbers of cattle of all kinds. But the most particu¬ lar account we have of these people is from Moore, + Travels who saysf, “ Some of these Full blacks, who dwell on into distant both sides the river Gambia, are in subjection to the parts of Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell, having been Africa, prohably driven out of their country by war or famine",Moore,"GM,GN,SN,US,IN",6,"Gambia,Guinea,Senegal,United States,India","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"

Some authors say, that weaving is their principal trade : this is done by the women and girls, who spin and weave very fine cot¬ ton cloth, which they dye blue or black. Moore says, the Jalofs particularly make great quantities ot the cot¬ ton cloth 5 their pieces are generally 27 yards long, and about nine inches broad, their looms being very narrow j these they sew neatly together, so as to supply the use of broad cloth",Moore,US,6,United States,North America
"It was in these parts of Guinea that M. Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, was employed from the year 1749 to the year 1753, wholly in making natural and philosophical ob¬ servations on the country about the rivers Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great heats in Senegal, he essays*, “ it is to them that they are partly indebted for the fertility of their lands •, which is so great, that, with oS‘little labour and care, there is no fruit nor grain but grows in great plenty.” Of the soil on the Gambia, he says, “ it is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile ; it produces spontaneous¬ ly, and almost without cultivation, all the necessaries of life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots. Every thing matures to perfection, and is excellent in its kind.” One thing which always surprised him, was the pro¬ digious rapidity with which the sap of trees repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in that country j “ Arid I was never (says he) more astonished, than when landing four days after the locusts had devoured all the fruits and leaves, and even the buds of the trees, to find the trees covered, with new leaves, and they did not seem to me to have suffered much.”—“ It was then (says the same author) the fish season ; you might see them in shoals approaching towards land","Paris, Of","SN,GM,GN,US,TR",6,"Senegal,Gambia,Guinea,United States,Turkey","Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Asia"

"J he most ancient account we have of the country History of of the negroes, particularly that part situated on and t^ie ^u^Ilea between the two great rivers of Senegal and Gambia,tra(,e' is from the writings of two ancient authors, one an Arabian, and the other a Moor. The first wrote in Arabic about the 12th century. His works, printed in that language at Rome, were afterwards translated into Latin, and printed at Paris under the patronage of the famous Thuanus chancellor of France, with the title of Geographia Nuhtensis, containing an account of all the nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia. The other was written by John Leo, a Moor, born at Grana¬ da in Spain, before the Moors were totally expelled from that kingdom. He resided in Afi ica ; but being on a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken by some Ita¬ lian corsairs, who finding him possessed of several Arabian books, besides his own manuscripts, appre¬ hended him to be a man of learning, and as such pre¬ sented him to Pope Leo X. This pope encouraging him, he embraced the Romish religion, and his de¬ scription of Africa was published in Italian. From these writings we gather, that after the Mahometan religion had extended to the kingdom of Morocco, some of the promoters of it crossing the sandy deserts of Numidia, which separate that country from Gui¬ nea, found it inhabited by men, who, though under no regular government, and destitute of that know¬ ledge the Arabians were favoured with, lived in con¬ tent and peace. The first author particularly remarks, “ that they never made war, or travelled abroad, but employed themselves in tending their herds, or labour¬ ing in the ground.” J. Leo says, p. 65. “ That they lived in common, having no property in land, no tyrant nor superior lord, but supported themselves in an equal state, upon the natural produce of the coun¬ try, which afforded plenty of roots, game, and honey","Rome, Paris, Tripoli, Tunis","SN,GM,US,FR,ES,MA,LY,TN,IT",6,"Senegal,Gambia,United States,France,Spain,Morocco,Libya,Tunisia,Italy","Africa,Africa,North America,Europe,Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Europe"
"That ambition or avarice never drove them into foreign countries to subdue or cheat their neighbours. Thus they lived without toil or superfluities.”—“ The an¬ cient inhabitants of Morocco, who wore coats of mail, and used swords and spears beaded with iron, coming amongst these harmless and naked people, soon brought them under subjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gambia into 15 parts ; those were the 15 kingdoms of the negroes, over which the Moors presided, and the common peo¬ ple were negroes. These Moors taught the negroes the Mahometan religion, and arts of life; particularly the use of iron, before unknown to them. About the 14th century, a native negro, called Heli Isc/iia, expelled the Moorish conquerors ; but though the ne¬ groes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a negro master. Heli Ischia himself becoming king, led the negroes on to foreign wars, a.id established himself in power over a very large S extent G U I [ 138 ] GUI Since Leo’s time, the Europe- night, would surprise some fishermen’s villages: that entered into the country, and carried off Guinea, extent of country.” —-vr——’ ans have had very little knowledge ot those parts ot Africa, nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly probable that it broke into pieces, and that the natives again resumed many of their an¬ cient customs j for in the account published by Moore, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Moorish and Mahometan customs, joined with the original simplicity of the negroes. It appears by accounts of ancient voyages, collected by Hackluit, Purchas, and others, that it was about 50 years before the discovery of America, that the Portuguese at¬ tempted to sail round Cape Bojador, which lies be¬ tween their country and Guinea : this, after divers repulses occasioned by the violent currents, they effected ; when landing on the western coasts of Africa, they soon began to make incursions into the country, and to seize and carry off the native inha¬ bitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gon¬ zales, the first who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coast, pursued and attacked a number of them, when some were wounded, as was also one of the Portuguese *, which the author re¬ cords as the first blood spilt by Christians in those parts. Six years after, the same Gonzales again at¬ tacked the natives and took 12 prisoners, with whom he returned to his vessels : he afterwards put a woman on shore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the prisoners j but the next day 150 of the inhabitants ap¬ peared on horses and camels, provoking the Portu¬ guese to land *, which they not daring to venture, the natives discharged a volley of stones at them, and went off. After this, the Portuguese still continued to send vessels on the coast of Africa : particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled, and, being pursued, 25 were taken ; “ he that ran best (says the author), taking the most.” In their way home they killed some of the natives, and took 55 more prisoners. Afterwards Dinisanes Dagrama, with two other vessels, landed on the island Arguin, where they took 54 Moors*, then running along the coast 80 leagues farther, they at several times took 50 slaves ; but here seven of the Portuguese were killed",Moore,"PT,GN,GM,MA,SN,US,LY",6,"Portugal,Guinea,Gambia,Morocco,Senegal,United States,Libya","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Africa"
"Anderson, in his History of Trade and Commerce, p. 336. speaking of what passed in the year 1308, writes, “ That the Spaniards had by this time found that the miserable Indian natives, whom they had made to work in their mines and fields, were not so ro¬ bust and proper for those purposes as negroes brought from Africa: wherefore they, about that time, began to import negroes for that end into Hispaniola, from the Portuguese settlements on the Guinea coasts j and also afterwards for their sugar-works.” It was about the year 1551, towards the latter end of the reign of Edward VI. when some London mer¬ chants sent out the first English ship on a trading voy¬ age to the coast of Guinea. This was soon followed by several others to the same parts $ but the English not having then any plantations in the West Indies, and consequently no occasion for negroes, such ships tra¬ ded only for gold, elephants teeth, and Guinea pepper","Anderson, London","GN,UK,US,GB,IN,PT",6,"Guinea,N/A,United States,United Kingdom,India,Portugal","Africa,N/A,North America,Europe,Asia,Europe"
"“ That when Captain Hawkins returned from his first voyage to Africa, Queen Elizabeth sent for him, when she expressed her concern, lest any of the African ne¬ groes should be carried off without their free consent ; which she declared would be detestable, and would call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.” Hawkins made great promises, which nevertheless he did not perform ; for his next voyage to the coast ap¬ pears to have been principally calculated to procure negro slaves, in order to sell them to the Spaniards in the West Indies 5 which occasioned the same author to use these remarkable words: “ Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into slavery ; an in¬ justice and barbarity which, so sure as there is ven¬ geance in heaven for the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction of all who act or who encou¬ rage it.” This Captain Hawkins, afterwards Sir John Hawkins, seems to have been the first Englishman who gave public countenance to this wicked traffic : for Anderson, before mentioned, at p. 401. says, “ That in the year 1562, Captain Hawkins, assisted by sub¬ scription of sundry gentlemen, now fitted out three ships ; and having learnt that negroes were a very good commodity in Hispaniola, he sailed to the coast of Guinea, took in negroes, and sailed with them for Hispaniola, where he sold them, and his English com¬ modities, and loaded his three vessels with hides, sugar, ginger, See. with which he returned home anno 1563, making a prosperous voyage.” As it proved a lucra¬ tive business, the trade was continued both by Haw¬ kins and others, as appears from the Naval Chronicle, p. 55.: where it is said, “ That on the 18th of Octo¬ ber 1564, Captain John Hawkins, with two ships of 700 and 140 tons, sailed for Africa ; that on the 8th of December they anchored to the south of Cape Verd, where the captain manned the boat, and sent 80 men in armour into the country, to see if they could take some negroes ; but the natives flying from them, they returned to their ships, and proceeded farther down the coast. Here they staid certain days, send¬ ing their meii. ashore, in order (as the author says) to burn and spoil their towns and take the inhabitants",Anderson,"GN,US,UK",6,"Guinea,United States,N/A","Africa,North America,N/A"
"his voyage round the world, went with Sir John Haw- v J kins in his expedition to the coast of Guinea, where taking in a cargo of slaves, they determined to steer for the Caribbee islands.” How Queen Elizabeth suf¬ fered so grievous an infringement of the rights of man¬ kind to be perpetrated by her subjects, and how she was persuaded, about the 30th year of her reign, to grant patents for carrying on a trade from the north part of the river Senegal to 100 leagues beyond Sierra Leona, which gave rise to the African Company See Cowi- is hard to account for, any otherwise than that it?;<wi/> vol",Elizabeth,"GN,SN,US",6,"Guinea,Senegal,United States","Africa,Africa,North America"
"In fact, it was long after the Portuguese had made a practice of violently forcing the natives of Africa into slavery, that we read of the diQerent negro nations making war upon each other, and selling their cap¬ tives. And probably this was not the case, till those bordering on the coast, who had been used to supply the vessels with necessaries, had become corrupted by their intercourse with the Europeans, and were excited by drunkenness and avarice to join them in carrying on those wicked schemes, by which those unnatural wars were perpetrated, the inhabitants kept in con¬ tinual alarms, the country laid waste, and, as Moore expresses it, “ infinite numbers sold into slavery.” But that the Europeans are the principal cause of these de¬ vastations, is particularly evidenced by one whose con¬ nection with the trade would rather induce him to represent it in the fairest colours, viz. Captain Smith, the person sent in the year 1726, by the African com¬ pany, to survey their settlements j who, from the in¬ formation he received of one of the factors who had re¬ sided ten years in that country, says, “ That the dis¬ cerning natives account it their greatest unhappiness, * Smith, that they were ever visited by tbe Europeans*.—That p. z66, we Christians introduced the traffic of slaves; and that before our coming they lived in peace.” In the accounts relating to the African trade, w'e find this melancholy truth farther asserted by some of the principal directors in the different factories: par- f Cn/iection, ticularly A. Brue says f, “ That the Europeans were far from desiring to act as peace-makers amongst the p. 9S, negroes ; which would be acting contrary to their in¬ terest, since tbe greater the wars, the more slaves were . procured.” And William Bosman also remarksJ, “ That J'- ^ ' one of the former commanders gave large sums of money to the negroes of one nation, to induce them to attack some of the neighbouring nations; which oc¬ casioned a battle which was more bloody than the wars of the negroes usually are.” This is confirmed by J. Barbot, who says, “ That the country of D’El- mina, which was formerly very powerful and populous, was in his time so much drained of its Inhabitants by the intestine wars fomented among tbe negroes by tbe Dutch, that there did not remain inhabitants enough to till the country.” It has also been advanced as an argument in favour of keeping the negroes in bondage, that there are slaves in Guinea, and that those amongst us might be so in their own country. Not to dwell upon the incon¬ sistency of our giving any countenance to slavery, be¬ cause the Africans, whom we esteem a barbarous and savage people, allow of it, and perhaps the more from our example ; the very circumstance stated, when in¬ quired into, must afford cause of blushing, rather than serve as a palliation of such iniquitous conduct: for it will appear, that the slavery endured in Guinea is by no means so grievous as that in the colonies. Captain Moore, speaking of the natives living on the river Gam¬ bia, says, “ That some of the negroes have many house r ","Moore, Moore","GN,US,PT,NL",6,"Guinea,United States,Portugal,Netherlands","Africa,North America,Europe,Europe"
"the negroes of North Guinea and the Gold Coast are said to be fond of their children, whom they love with tenderness. And Bosman says, p. 340. “ Not a few in his country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine, that pa¬ rents here sell their children, men their wives, and one brother the other: but those who think so, deceive themselves 5 for this never happens on any other ac¬ count but that of necessity, or some great crime.” The same is repeated by J. Barbot, p. 326. and also confirmed by Sir Hans Sloane in the introduction to his natural history of Jamaica ; where, speaking of the negroes, he says, “ they are usually thought to be ha¬ ters of their own children ; and therefore it is believed that they sell and dispose of them to strangers for mo¬ ney : but this is not true •, for the negroes of Guinea being divided into several captainships, as well as the Indians of America, have wars ; and besides those slain in battle, many prisoners are taken, who are sold as slaves, and brought thither : but the parents here, al¬ though their children are slaves for ever, yet have so great love for them, that no masters dare sell or give away one of their little ones unless they care not whe¬ ther their parents hang themselves or not.” J. Bar¬ bot, speaking of the occasion of the natives of Guinea being represented as a treacherous people, ascribes it to the Hollanders (and doubtless other Europeans) usurp¬ ing authority, and fomenting divisions between the ne¬ groes. At p. no. he says, “ It is well known that many of the European nations, trading amongst these people, have very unjustly and inhumanly, without any provocation, stolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coast, but almost every¬ where in Guinea, who have come on board their ships in a harmless and confiding manner : these they have in great numbers carried away, and sold in the plantations, with other slaves which they had purchased.” And al¬ though some of the negroes may he justly charged with indolence and supineness, yet many others are frequent¬ ly mentioned by authors as a careful, industrious, and even laborious people","Gold Coast, Holland, Bar","GN,JM,AU,US,UA",6,"Guinea,Jamaica,Australia,United States,Ukraine","Africa,North America,Oceania,North America,Europe"
"Moore also mentions man-stealing as being discounte¬ nanced by the negro governments on the river Gambia ; and speaks of the enslaving the peaceable inhabitants, as a violence which only happens under a corrupt admi¬ nistration of justice. He says, “ The kings of that country generally advise with their head men, scarcely- doing any thing of consequence without consulting them first, except the king of Barsailay, who being subject to hard drinking, is very absolute. It is to this king’s insatiable thirst for brandy, that his subjects freedoms and families are in so precarious a situation",Moore,"GM,US",6,"Gambia,United States","Africa,North America"
"I cannot (adds Moore) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade, but there may, per¬ haps, be about 100, who go up into the inland country with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them purchase, in various coun¬ tries, gold, slaves, and elephants teeth. Besides the slaves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: These are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes j ot' else people stolen, which is very frequent.—Smcz the 2 ] GUI slave-trade has been used, all punishments are changed Gab* into slavery ; there being an advantage on such con- demnation, they strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the criminal.’1'' John Barbot, the French factor, in bis account of the manner by which the slaves are procured, says, “ The slaves sold by the negroes are for the most part prisoners of war, or taken in the incursions they make into their enemies territories j others are stolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods’, or else in the corn-fields, at the time of the year when their parents keep them there all the day to scare away the devouring small birds.” Speaking of the transactions on that part of Guinea called the Slave Coast, where the Europeans have the most facto¬ ries, and from whence they bring away much the greatest number of slaves, the same author says, “The inhabitants of Goto do much mischief in stealing those slaves they sell to the Europeans from the upland country.———That the inhabitants of Popo excel the former $ being endowed with a much larger share of courage, they rob more successfully, by which means they increase their riches and trade.” The author par¬ ticularly remarks, “ That they are encouraged in this practice by the Europeans: sometimes it happens, ac¬ cording to the success of their inland excursions, that they are able to furnish 200 slaves or more in a few days.” And he says, “ The blacks of Fida, or Whi- dah, are so expeditious in trading for slaves, that they can deliver 1000 every month.”—“ If there happens to be no stock of slaves there, the factor must trust the blacks with his goods, to the value of 150I. or 200I",Moore,"GN,US,FR",6,"Guinea,United States,France","Africa,North America,Europe"

The plan was formed by the car¬ dinal, his younger brother ; and under the pretext of defending the Roman Catholic religion, the king Henry III. and the freedom of the state, against the design of the Huguenots, or French Protestants, they carried on a civil war, massacred the Huguenots, and governed the king, who forbid his appearance at Pa¬ ris ; but Guise now became an open rebel, entered the city against the king’s express order, and put to the sword all who opposed him ; the streets being barrica¬ ded to prevent bis progress, this fatal day is called in the French history, The day of the barricades.

"Mortars are thought to have been fully as ancient as cannon. They were employed in the wars of Ita¬ ly, to throw balls of red-hot iron, stones, &c. long before the invention of shells. These last are thought to be of German invention, and the use of them in war to have been taught by the following accident. A citi¬ zen of Venlo, at a certain festival celebrated in honour of the duke of Cleves, threw a number of shells, one of which fell on a house and set fire to it, by which misfortune the greatest part of the town was reduced to ashes. The first account of shells used for military purposes is in 1435, when Naples was besieged by Charles VIII. History informs us with more certain¬ ty, that shells were thrown out of mortars at the siege of Wachtendonk in Guelderland, in 1588, by the earl of Mansfeld. Mr Malter, an English engineer, first taught the French the art of throwing shells, which they practised at the siege of Motte in 1634. The method of throwing red-hot balls out of mortars was first certainly put in practice at the siege of Stralsund in 1675 by the elector of Brandenburgh ; though some say in 1653 at f*16 siege of Bremen.

"The first author who wrote professedly on the flight of cannon-shot was Tartalea. In 1537 he published a book, at Venice, entitled Nova Scientia; and after¬ wards another, entitled Qiussiti et Inventioni diver printed at the same place in 1546, in which he treats professedly on these motions. His discoveries were but few, on account of the imperfect state of mechanical knowledge at that time. However, he determined, that the greatest range of cannon was with an elevation of 45 degrees. He likewise determined, (contrary to the opinion of practitioners), that no part of the track described by a bullet was a right line ; although the curvature was in some cases so little, that it was not attended to. He compared it to the surface of the sea ; which, though it appears to be a plane, is yet un¬ doubtedly incurvated round the centre of the earth",Venice,US,6,United States,North America
"After him Eldred and Anderson, both Englishmen, published treatises on this subject. The first publish¬ ed his treatise in 1646, and has given the actual ranges of different pieces of artillery at small elevations, all under ten degrees. His principles were not rigorously true, though not liable to very considerable errors ; yet, in consequence of their deviation from the truth, he ( 150 Theory, he found It impossible to make some of his experiments > ■ — mj agree with his principles",Anderson,US,6,United States,North America
"Vew^theo- I^74> Anderson above mentioned published ryby An- h's treatise on the nature and effects of the gun ; in derson. which he proceeds on the principles of Galileo, and strenuously asserts, that the flight of all bullets is in the curve of a parabola ; undertaking to answer all objections that could be brought to the contrary. The same thing was also undertaken by Mr Blondel, in a treatise published at Paris in 1683 ; where, after long discussion, the author concludes, that the variations from the air’s resistance are so slight as scarce to merit notice. The same subject is treated of in the Philoso¬ phical Transactions, N° 216. p. 68. by Dr Halley; and he also, swayed by the very great disproportion be¬ tween the density of the air and that of iron or lead, thinks it reasonable to believe, that the opposition of the air to large metal-shot is scarcely discernible; al¬ though in small and light shot he owns that it must be accounted for","Anderson, Paris",US,6,United States,North America
"But though this hypothesis went on smoothly in speculation ; yet Anderson, who made a great number of trials, found it impossible to support it without some new modification. For though it does not appear that he ever examined the comparative ranges of either cannon or musket shot when fired with their usual velocities, yet his experiments on the ranges of shells thrown with small velocities (in comparison of those above mentioned), convinced him that their whole track was not parabolical. But instead of making the proper inferences from hence, and concluding the resistance of the air to be of considerable efficacy, he framed a new hypothesis ; which was, that the shell or bullet, at its first discharge, flew to a certain distance in a right line, from the end of which line only it be¬ gan to describe a parabola. And this right line, which he calls the line of the impulse of the fire^ he Sect, [, supposes to be the same in all elevations. Thus, by Tj,e assigning a proper length to this line of impulse, it was 4 always in his power to reconcile any two shots made at different angles, let them differ as widely as we please to suppose. But this he could not have done with three shots ; nor indeed doth he ever tell us the * event of his experiments when three ranges were tried j at one time. 6 f, When Sir Isaac Newton’s Principia was published,Lawi g he particularly considered the resistance of the air to the ai j. d projectiles which moved with small velocities ; but he never had an opportunity of making experiments^1^ on those which move with such prodigious swiftness, he did not imagine that a difference in velocity could make such difl’erences in the resistance as are now found to take place. Sir Isaac found, that, in small velocities, the resistance was increased in the duplicate proportion of the swiftness with which the body moved ; that is, a body moving with twice the velocity of another of equal magnitude, would meet with four times as much resistance as the first, with thrice the velocity it would meet with nine times the resistance, &c.—This prin- j^J ciple itself is now found to be erroneous with regard toinraj]i ^ military projectiles; though, if it had been properlyprojet. | attended to, the resistance of the air might even from thence have been reckoned much more considerable than was commonly done. So far, however, were those who treated this subject scientifically, from giving a proper allowance for the resistance of the atmosphere, that their theories differed most egregiously from the truth. Huygens alone seems to have attended to this principle : for, in the year 1690, he published a Treatise on Gravity, in which he gave an account of some experiments tending to prove, that the track of all projectiles moving with very swift motions was widely different from that of a parabola. All the rest of the learned acquiesced in the justness of Galileo’s doctrine, and very erroneous calculations concerning the ranges of cannon were accordingly given. Nor was any notice taken of these errors till the year 1716. ; At that time M. Bessons, a French officer of artillery,Alltl distinguished by the number of sieges at which he hadikori served, by his high military rank, and by his abilities'^1' in his profession, gave in a memoir to the Royal Aca-^| demy, of which he was a member, importing, that, “ although it was agreed, that theory joined with practice did constitute the perfection of every art; yet experience had taught him, that theory was of very little service in the use of mortars : That the works of M. Blondel had justly enough described the several parabolic lines, according to the different degrees of the elevation of the piece ; but that practice had con¬ vinced him, there was no theory in the effect of gun¬ powder ; for having endeavoured, with the greatest pre¬ cision, to point a mortar agreeably to these calqulations, he had never been able to establish any solid foundation upon them.” From the history of the academy, it doth not appear that the sentiments of M. Bessons were at any time controverted, or any reason offered for the failure of the theory of projectiles when applied to use. No¬ thing fai'ther, however, was done till the time of Ben¬ jamin Robins, who in 1742 published a treatise, en*Mr1^ titled, New Principles of Gunnery, in which he hathfi”1 ^ treated particularly not only of the resistance of tfie^* atmosphere, GUNNERY",Anderson,"US,FR",6,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"GUNN 39th Prop, of lib. I. of Sir Isaac Newton’s Principia, the areas FLPB and FHQB are in the duplicate pro¬ portion of the velocities which the ball would acquire when acted upon by its own gravity through the space FB, and when impelled through the same space by the force of the powder. But since the ratio ot AI to AB and the ratio of FH to 1* L are known, the ratio of the area FLPB to the area FHQB is known •, and thence its subduplicate. And since the line FB is gi¬ ven in magnitude, the velocity which a heavy body would acquire when impelled through this line by its own gravity is known ; being no other than the velo¬ city it would acquire by falling through a space equal to ""that line : find then another velocity to which this last mentioned velocity bears the given ratio of the sub¬ duplicate of the area FLPB to the area FHQB j and this velocity thus found is the velocity the ball will ac¬ quire when impelled through the space FB by the ac¬ tion of the inflamed powder",Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"Now, if a computation be made according to the method laid down for compressed fluids in the 38th pro¬ position of Newton’s. Principia, supposing the weight of water to that of air as 850 to 1, it will be found, that the resistance to a globe of three-fourths of an inch diameter, moving with a velocity of about 1600 feet in a second, will not, on these principles, amount to any more than 4^1b. avoirdupois ; whence, as we know that the rules contained in that proposition are very accurate with jegard to slow motions, we may hence conclude, that the resistance of the air in slow motions is less than that in swift motions, in the ratio of 4^ to 10; a pro¬ portion between that of 1 to 2, and 1 to 3",Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"However, this perhaps may be compensated by the greater heat which in all probability attends the firing of these large quantities of powder. 14 “From this great velocity of cannon shot we maySolu^ clear up the difficulty concerning the point-blank shot of which occasioned the invention of Anderson’s strange hypothesis '*. Here our author was deceived by hbpoinl.bl not knowing how greatly the primitive velocity of tbe6hot",Anderson,US,6,United States,North America
"r It is an objection that hath been made to the mathe- a matical philosophy, and to which in many cases it is most certainly liable, that it considers the resistance of as matter more than its capacity of giving motion to other ,r matter. Hence, if in any case matter acts both as a resisting and a moving power, and the mathematician overlooks its effort towards motion, founding his de¬ monstrations only upon its property of resisting, these demonstrations will certainly be false, though they should be supported by all the powers of geometry. It is to an error of this kind that we are to attribute the great dif¬ ferences already taken notice of between the calcula¬ tions of Sir Isaac Newton, with regard to the resisting force of fluids, and what actually takes place upon trial",Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"Hence he accounts for the great increase of resistance to bullets moving with such velocities ; but as he doth not take notice of the loss of the air’s moving power, the anomalies of all lesser velocities are inexplicable on his principles. Nay, he even tells us, that Sir Isaac Newton’s rule for computing resistances may be applied in all velocities less than 1100 or 1200 feet in a second, though this is expressly contradicted by his own expe¬ riments mentioned N° 23",Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"“ To put the matter beyond all doubt, let us see what the resistance was that these bullets met with, and how much their velocities were diminished by it. The weight of the bullet in the most emmeous experiment was 90 grains ; its diameter 0.78 of an inch ; and it was projected with a velocity of 2109 feet in a second. If now a computation be made according to the law laid down by Sir Isaac Newton for compressed fluids, it will be found, that the resistance to this bullet was not less than 8J- pounds avoirdupois, which is something more than 660 times its own weight. But Mr Robins has shewn by experiment, that the resistance of the air to bodies moving in it with very great velocity, is near three times greater than Sir Isaac has determined it; and as the velocity with which this bullet was im¬ pelled is considerably greater than any in Mr Robins’s experiments, it is highly probable, that the resistance in this instance was at least 2000 times greater than the weight of the bullet",Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"2098 1382 1169 2109 1430 1288 Difference after correction, +11 +4^ +II9 “ It appears, therefore, that notwithstanding these corrections, the velocities as determined by the pendu¬ lum, particularly in the last, were considerably defici¬ ent. But the manifest irregularity of the velocities in those instances, affords abundant reason to conclude, that it must have arisen from some accidental cause, and therefore that little dependence is to be put upon the result of those experiments. I cannot take upon me to determine positively what the cause was which produced this irregularity, but I strongly suspect that it arose from the breaking of the bullets in the barrel by the force of the explosion : for these bullets, as has already been mentioned, were formed of lead, inclosing lesser bullets of plaster of Paris ; and I well remember to have observed at the time several small fragments of the plaster which had fallen down by the side of the pendulum. I confess I did not then pay much atten¬ tion to this circumstance, as I naturally concluded that it arose from the breaking of the bullet in penetrating the target of the pendulum ; and that the small pieces of plaster I saw upon the ground, had fallen out of the hole by which the bullet entered. But if the bullets were not absolutely broken in pieces in firing, yet if they were considerably bruised, and the plaster, or a part of it, were separated from the lead, such a change in the form might produce a great increase in the re¬ sistance, and even their initial velocities might be af¬ fected by it ; for their form being changed from that of a globe to some other figure, they might not fit the bore ; and a part of the force of the charge might be lost by the wdndage That this actually happened in the experiment last mentioned, seems very probable, as the velocity with which the bullet was projected, as it (a) They were made of lead inclosing a nucleus of Paris plaster","Paris, Paris",US,6,United States,North America
"Having determined the comparative degrees of strength of two different kinds of powder, their com¬ parative value may be ascertained by augmenting the quantity of the weaker powder till the velocity of the bullets in both cases becomes the same. The strong powder is therefore precisely as much more valuable than the weak, as it produces the same effect with a smaller quantity. Thus if a quarter of an ounce of one kind of powder discharges a bullet with the same velocity that half an ounce of another kind does, it is plain that the former is twice as valuable as the latter, and ought to be sold at double the price.—By compa¬ risons of this kind, Count Bum ford found that the best battle powder (so called from its being made at the village of Battle in Kent) is stronger than government powder, in the proportion of 4 to 3 ; but from a com¬ parison of the prices, it appears that the former is no less than 41-! per cent, dearer than it ought to be ; and consequently, that whoever mes it in preference to go¬ vernment powder, does it at a certain loss of /\ij per cent, of the money it costs him",Kent,US,6,United States,North America

"The superiority of twisted and ribbon barrels over the plain kind gave occasion to a third sort named wired barrels. These were invented by an ingenious workman at Paris named Barrois; whose method was as follows : Upon a thin barrel, filed and dressed as usual, he rolled, as close as possible, and in a spiral di¬ rection, a tempered iron wire about the thickness of a crow-quill, the first layer covering only the reinforced part. The turns of the wire were soldered to each other and to the barrel with a composition which he kept a secret. The wired part was then filed smooth and bright, but not so much as to weaken it; a second layer of wire was applied over the first, extending two- thirds of the length of the barrel ; and this being smoothed and brightened like the first, a third layer was applied, which covered the two former and reached quite to the muzzle",Paris,US,6,United States,North America

"They are a strange kind of commonwealth among themselves of wandering impostors and jugglers, who made their first appearance in Germany about the be¬ ginning of the 16th century. Munster, it is true, who is followed and relied upon by Spelman, fixes the time of their first appearance to the year 1417 : as lle owns that the first whom he ever saw were in 1529, it is probably an error of the press for 1517 ; especially as other historians inform us, that when Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in the year 1517, several of the na¬ tives refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and re¬ volted under one Zinganeus ; whence the Turks call them Zinganees ; but being at length surrounded and ■ banished, they agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of su¬ perstition and credulity. In the compass of a very few years they gained such a number of idle proselytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and be¬ took themselves to the same arts of chiromancy, beg¬ ging, and pilfering), that they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.— Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1560, and from Spain in 1591. And the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in 1530 they are described by Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. as “ an outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, i> using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have come into this realm, and gone from shire to shire, and place to place, in great companies, and used great, subtle, ‘ and crafty means to deceive the people ; bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men’s and ( women’s fortunes ; and so many times by craft and shb- tility have deceived the people of their money, and also ► have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.” t Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, and forfei¬ ture of their goods and chattels ; and upon their trials > for any felony which they may have committed, they shall not be entitled to a jury de medietate linguce.

"HABDALA, a ceremony of the Jews observed on the evening of the sabbath when every one of the fa¬ mily ( p * H A B [ 209 ] H A B dala mily is come home. At that time they light a taper beas or lamp, with two wicks at least. The master of the pus. family then takes a cup, with some wine, mixed with fragrant spices, and having repeated a passage or two of Scripture, as for example, “ I will take the cup of salvation,” &c. Psal. cxvi. and “ The Jews had light and gladness,” &c. Esth. viii. he blesses the wine and spices. Afterwards he blesses the light of the fire ; and then casts his eyes on his hands and nails, as remem¬ bering that he is going to work. The whole is in¬ tended to signify, that the sabbath is over, and is from that moment divided from the day of labour which follows. For this reason the ceremony is called Hab- clala, which signifies “ distinction.” After the cere¬ mony is over, and the company breaks up, they wish one another, not “ a good night,” but “ a good week.” HABEAS corpus, in L aiv, is the great remedy in cases of False Imprisonment. The incapacity of the three other remedies referred to under that article, to give complete relief in every case, hath almost entirely antiquated them, and hath caused a general resource to be had, in behalf of persons aggrieved by illegal imprisonment, to the present writ, the most celebra¬ ted in the English law. Of this there are various kinds made use of by the courts at Westminster, for removing prisoners from one court into another for the more easy administration of justice. Such is the ha¬ beas corpus ad respondendum, when a man hath a cause of action against one who is confined by the process of some inferior court; in order to remove the prisoner, and charge him with this new action in the court above. Such is that ad satisfaciendum, when a prison¬ er hath had judgment against him in an action, and the plaintiff is desirous to bring him up to some supe¬ rior court to charge him with process of execution","Of, Westminster","TR,US,UK",6,"Turkey,United States,N/A","Asia,North America,N/A"
"mit to, and receive whatsoever the judge or conx\.^omment‘ awarding such writ shall consider in that behalf. This is a high prerogative writ, and therefore by the com¬ mon law issuing out of the court of king’s bench, not only in term-time, but also during the vacation, by a fiat from the chief justice, or any other of the judges, and running into all parts of the king’s dominions: for the king is at all times intitled to have an account why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted. If it issues in vacation, it is usually returnable before the judge himself who awarded it, and he proceeds by himself thereon j unless the term should intervene, and then it may be returned in court. Indeed, if the party were privileged in the courts of common pleas and exche¬ quer, as being an officer or suitor of the court, an ha¬ beas corpus ad subjiciendum might also have been award¬ ed from thence j and, if the cause of imprisonment were palpably illegal, they might have discharged him : but if he were committed for any criminal matter, they could only have remanded him, or taken bail for his appearance in the court of king’s bench j which occa¬ sioned the common pleas to discountenance such ap¬ plications. It hath also been said, and by very re¬ spectable authorities, that the like habeas corpus mav issue out of the court of chancery in vacation : but upon the famous application to Lord Nottingham by Jenks, notwithstanding the most diligent searches, no precedent could be found where the chancellor had is¬ sued such a writ in vacation ; and therefore his lordship refused it",Jenks,US,6,United States,North America
"In the court of king’s bench it was, and is still, necessary to apply for it by motion to the court, as in the case of all other prerogative writs {certiorari, pro¬ hibition, mandamus, &c.) which do not issue as of mere course, without showing some probable cause why the extraordinary power of the crown is called in to the party’s assistance. For, as was argued by Lord chief justice Vaughan, “ it is granted on motion, be¬ cause it cannot be had of course ; and there is there¬ fore no necessity to grant it $ for the court ought to be satisfied that the party hath a probable cause to be delivered.” And this seems the more reasonable, because, when once granted, the person to whom k is directed can return no satisfactory excuse for not bringing up the body of the prisoner. So that, if it D d issued j H A B [21 Habeas issued of mere course, without showing to the court Corpus, or judge some reasonable ground for awarding it, a v"" ' traitor or felon under sentence of death, a soldier or mariner in the king’s service, a wife, a child, a rela¬ tion, or a domestic, confined for insanity or other pru¬ dential reasons, might obtain a temporary enlargement by suing out an habeas corpus, though sure to be re¬ manded as soon as brought up to the court. And therefore Sir Edward Coke, when chief justice, did not scruple, in 13 Jac. I. to deny a habeas corpus to one confined by the court of admiralty for piracy j there appearing, upon his own showing, sufficient grounds to confine him. On the other hand, if a probable ground be shown, that the party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore hath a right to be delivered, the writ of habeas corpus is then a writ of right, which “ may not be denied, but ought to be granted to every man that is committed, or detained in pri¬ son, or otherwise restrained, though it be by the command of the king, the privy-council, or any other.” In the articles Liberty and Rights, will be found a full discussion of the personal liberty of the subject. This is shown to be a natural inherent right, which could not be surrendered or forfeited unless by the commis¬ sion of some great and atrocious crime, and which ought not to be abridged in any case without the spe¬ cial permission of law j a doctrine coeval with the first rudiments of our constitution •, and handed down to us from the Anglo-Saxons, notwithstanding all their struggles with the Danes, and the violence of the Norman conquest: asserted afterwards and confirmed by the conqueror himself and his descendants j and though sometimes a little impaired by the ferocity of the times, and the occasional despotism of jealous or usurping princes, yet established on the firmest basis by the provisions of magna charta, and a long suctession of statutes enacted under Edward III. To assert an absolute exemption from imprisonment in all cases, is inconsistent with every idea of law and political socie¬ ty ; and in the end would destroy all civil liberty, by rendering its protection impossible: but the glory of the English law consists in clearly defining the time, the causes, and the extent, when, wherefore, and to what degree, the imprisonment of the subject may be lawful. 1 his it is which induces the absolute neces¬ sity of expressing upon every commitment the reason for which it is made : that the court, upon an habeas corpus, may examine, into its validity ; and according to the circumstances of the case may discharge, admit to bail, or remand the prisoner","Vaughan, Liberty, Norman","US,CA,UK",6,"United States,Canada,N/A","North America,North America,N/A"
"These pitiful evasions gave rise to the statute 16 Car. I. c. 10. § 8. whereby it is enacted, that if any person be committed by the king himself in person, or by his privy-council, or by any of the members thereof, he shall have granted unto him, ■without any delay, upon any pretence whatsoever, a wrrit oi habeas corpus, upon demand or motion made to the court of king’s bench or common pleas •, who shall thereupon, within three court days after the return is made, exa¬ mine and determine the legality of such commitment, and do what to justice shall appertain, in delivering, bailing, or remanding such prisoner. Yet still in the case of Jenks, before alluded to, who in 1676 was committed by the king in council for a turbulent speech at Guildhall, new shifts and devices were made use of to prevent his enlargement by law j the chief justice (as wTell as the chancellor), declining to award a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum in vacation, though at last he thought proper to award the usual writs ad deliberandum, &c. whereby the prisoner was discharged at the Old Bailey. Other abuses bad also crept into daily practice, which had in some measure defeated the benefit of this great constitutional re¬ medy. The party imprisoning was at liberty to de¬ lay his obedience to the first writ, and might wait till a second and a third, called an alias and a pluries, were issued, before he produced the party j and many other vexatious shifts were practised to detain state- prisoners in custody. But whoever will attentively consider the English history, may observe, that the flagrant abuse of any power, by the crown or its mi¬ nisters, has always been productive of a struggle ; which either discovers the exercise of that power to be contrary to law, or (if legal) restrains it for the future.

"In after-times, the Anglo-Saxons and Danes also considered fine hair as one of the greatest beauties and ornaments of their persons, and were at no little pains in dressing it to advantage. Young ladies before niai’- riage wore their hair uncovered and untied, flowing in ringlets over their shoulders; but as soon as they were married, they cut it shorter, tied it up, and put on a head-dress of some kind or other, according to the pre¬ vailing fashion. To have the hair entirely cut off was so gieat a disgrace, that it was one of the greatest pu¬ nishments inflicted on those women who were guilty of adultery. The Danish soldiers who were quartered up¬ on the English, in the reigns of Edgar the Peaceable and of Ethelred the Unready, were the beaux of those times, and were particularly attentive to the dressing of their hair ; which they combed at least once every day, and thereby captivated the affections of the Eng¬ lish ladies. The clergy, both secular and regular, were obliged to shave the crowns of their heads, and keep their hair short, which distinguished them from the laity } aud several canons were made against their con¬ cealing their tonsure, or allowing their hair to grow long. The shape of this clerical tonsure was the sub¬ ject of long and violent debates between the English clergy on the one hand, and those of the Scots and Piets on the other ; that of the former being circular, and that of the latter only semicircular. It appears very plainly, that long flowing hair was universally esteemed a great ornament; and the tonsure of the clergy was considered as an act of mortification and self-denial, to which many of them submitted with re¬ luctance, and endeavoured to conceal as much as pos¬ sible. Some of them who affected the reputation of su¬ perior sanctity inveighed with great bitterness against the long hair of the laity ; and laboured earnestly to persuade them to cut it short, in imitation of the cler¬ gy. Ihus the famous St Wulstan bishop of Worcester, is said to have declaimed with great vehemence against luxury of all kinds, hut chiefly against long hair as most criminal and most universal. “ The English (says Wil¬ liam of Malmsbury in his life of St Wulstan) were very vicious in their manners, and plunged in luxury, through the long peace which they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The holy prelate Wul¬ stan reproved the wicked of all ranks with great bold¬ ness ; hut he rebuked those with the greatest severity who were proud of their long hair. When any of those vain people bowed their heads before him to receive his blessing, before he gave it, he cut a lock of their hair with a little sharp knife, which he carried about him lor that purpose ; and commanded them, by way of penance for their sins, to cut all the rest of their hair in the same manner. If any of them refused to comply with this command, he denounced the most dreadful judgments upon them, reproached them for their effe¬ minacy, and foretold, that as they imitated women in the length of their hair, they would imitate them in their cowardice when their country was invaded • which was accomplished at the landing of the Nor¬ mans.” Ihis continued to be long a topic of declamation among ,the clergy, who even represented it as, one of the greatest crimes, and most certain marks of repro- , bation. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went so „ far as to pronounce the terrible sentence of excom¬ munication against all who wore long hair, for which pious zeal he is very much commended. Serlo, a Norman bishop, acquired great honour by a sermon which he preached before Henry I. A. D. 1104, against long and curled hair, with which the king and all his courtiers were so much affected, that they consented to resign their flowing ringlets, of which they had been so vain. The prudent prelate gave them no time to change their minds, but immediately pulled a pair of shears out of his sleeve, and performed the operation :( with his own hand. Another incident happened about j 25 years after, which gave a temporary check to the i prevailing fondness for long hair. It is thus related by a contemporary historian : “An event happened, 1 A. D. 1129, which seemed very wonderful to our | young gallants ; who, forgetting that they were men, 1 had transformed themselves into women by the length l of their hair. A certain knight, who was very proud j of his long luxuriant hair, dreamed that a person suffo- S cated him with its curls. As soon as he awoke from i his sleep, he cut his hair to a decent length. The re- 1 port of this spread over all England, and almost all i the knights reduced their hair to the proper standard. ! But this reformation was not of long continuance ; ) for in less than a year all who wished to appear fashion- i able returned to their former wickedness, and contend¬ ed with the ladies in length of hair. Those to whom nature had denied that ornament supplied the defect by art.” The Greeks, and, after their example, the Romans, wore false hair","Young, Worcester, Wil, Canterbury, Norman","UK,UY,ZA,CH,GB,US",6,"N/A,Uruguay,South Africa,Switzerland,United Kingdom,United States","N/A,South America,Africa,Europe,Europe,North America"

"Hale, Sir Mattheiu, lord chief justice of the king’s bench in the reign of Charles II. was the son of Ro¬ bert Hale, Esq. a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn, and was born in 1609. He was educated at Oxford, where he made a considerable progress in learning j but was afterwards diverted from his studies by the levities of youth. From these he was reformed by Mr John Glanvill serjeant at law ; and applying to the study of the law, entered into Lincoln’s Inn. Noy the attor¬ ney-general took early notice of him, and directed him in his studies. Mr Selden also took much notice of him *, and it was this acquaintance that first set Mr Hale on a more enlarged pursuit of learning, which he had before confined to his own profession. During the civil wars, ire behaved so well as to gain the esteem of both parties. He was employed in his practice by all the king’s party; and was appointed by the par¬ liament one of the commissioners to treat with the king. The murder of King Charles gave him very sen¬ sible regret. However, he took the engagement; and was appointed, with several others, to consider of the reformation of the law. In 1653 he was by writ made serjeant at law, and soon after appointed one of the justices of the Common Pleas. Upon the death of Oliver Cromwell he refused to accept of the new com¬ mission offered him by Richard his successor. He was returned one of the knights of Gloucestershire in the parliament which called home Charles II. Soon af¬ ter he was made lord chief baron of the exchequer ; but declined the honour of knighthood, till lord chan¬ cellor Hyde, sending for him upon business when the king was at his house, told his majesty, that “ there Was his modest chief baron j” upon which he was un¬ expectedly knighted. He was one of the principal judges that sat in Clifford’s Inn about settling the dif¬ ference between landlord and tenant, after the fire of London, in which he behaved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, and also in his post of chief baron acted with inflexible integrity. One of the first peers went once to his chamber, and told him, “ That ha¬ ving a suit in law to he tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better un¬ derstand it when it should come to be tried in court.” Upon which the lord chief baron interrupted him, and 23 ] HA L said, “ He did not deal fairly to come to his cham- Hale, hers about such affairs j for he never received informa- Hales, tion of such causes but in open court, where both par- 1 ■ 11 v—“ ties were to be heard alike.” Upon which his grace (for he was a duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the king as a rudeness that was not to be endured ; but his majesty bid him content himself that he was used no worse 5 and said, “ That he verily believed he would have used him po better if he had gone to solicit him in any of his own causes.” Another remarkable incident happened in one of his circuits. A gentleman who had a trial at the assizes had sent him a buck for his table. When Judge Hale therefore heard his name, he asked “ if he was not the same person who had sent him the venison ?” and find¬ ing that he was the same, told him, that “ he could not suffer the trial to go on till he had paid him for his buck.” The gentle man answered, that “ he never sold his venison ; and that he had done nothing to him which he did not do to every judge who had gone that circuit which was confirmed by several gentlemen present. I he lord chief baron, however, would not suffer the trial to proceed till he had paid for the pre¬ sent : upon which the gentleman withdrew the record","Hale, Hale, Lincoln, Oxford, Lincoln, Hale, Hyde, London, Hale, Hale","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

In 1696 he was entered a pensioner at Bennet-college, Cambridge ; and was admitted a fellow in 17°3> an^ became bachelor of divinity in 1711. He soon discovered a genius for natural philo¬ sophy. Botany was his first study ; and he used fre¬ quently to make excursions among Gogmagog hills, in company with Dr Stukely, with a view of prosecu¬ ting that study.

On the .5th of July 1733 the university of Oxford honoured him with a diploma for the degree of doctor in divinity ; a mark of distinction the more ho¬ nourable, as it is not usual for one university to confer academical honours on those who are educated at ano¬ ther. In 1734, when the health and morals of the lower and middling class of people were subverted by the excessive drinking of gin, he published, though with¬ out his name, A friendly Admonition to the Drinkers of Brandy and other spirituous Liquors j which was twice reprinted. The latter end of the same year he published a sermon which he preached at St Bride’s before the rest of the trustees for establishing a new colony in Georgia. His text was, “ Bear ye one ano¬ ther’s burthens, and so fulfil the law of Christ Gala¬ tians vi. 2.

That a man so devoted to philosophical studies and employ¬ ments, and so conscientious in the discharge of his duty, should not desire any preferment which should reduce him to the dilemma either of neglecting his duty, or foregoing his amusement, is not strange j but that he would refuse an honourable and profitable appointment, for which no duty was to be done that would interrupt his habits of life, can scarce be im¬ puted to his temperance and humility without im¬ peaching his benevolence j for if he had no wish of any thing more for himself, a liberal mind would surely have been highly gratified by the distribution of so considerable a sum as a canonry of Windsor would have put into his power, in the reward of industry, the alleviation of distress, and the support of helpless indigence.

"HALLEY, Dr Edmund, an eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in 1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676, he went to the island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of those which lie near the south pole ; and having delineated a planisphere in which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in 1678. In the year 1680, he took what is called the grand tour, accompanied by his friend the celebrated Mr Nelson. In the midway be¬ tween Calais and Paris, Mr Halley had a sight of a re¬ markable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in its return from the sun. He had the Novem¬ ber before seen it in its descent; and now hastened to complete his observations upon it, in viewing it from the royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was, to settle a friendly correspond¬ ence between the two royal astronomers of Greenwich and Paris j and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a master as Cassini. From thence he went to Italy, where he spent great part of the year 1681 j but his affairs calling him home, he returned to England. In 1683, he published his Theory of the va¬ riation of the magnetical compass; in which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, vyith four magnetical poles, or points of attraction : but af¬ terwards thinking that this theory was liable to great exceptions, he procured an application to be made to King YV illiam, who appointed him commander of the Paramour pink, with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty’s settlements in America.—He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698 : but having crossed the line, his men grew sickly ; and his lieutenant mutinying, he re¬ turned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he set sail a second time in Sep¬ tember following, with the same ship, and another of less bulk, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the vast Atlantic ocean from one hemisphere to the other, as far as the ice would permit him to go ; and having made his observations at St Helena Brazil, Cape Yerd, Barbadoes, the Madeiras, the Ca¬ naries, the coast of Barbary, and many other latitudes arrived in September 1700 $ and the next year publish- 2 ed a general chart, showing at one view the variation Han of the compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as U he was now called, had been at home little more than Halm half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe'""""""""7"" the course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal head-lands in the British channel : which having executed with his usual expedition and accuracy, he published a large map of the British chan¬ nel. Soon after, the emperor of Germany resolving to make a convenient harbour for shipping in the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to view the two ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702 j passed over to Holland} and going through Germany to Vienna, he proceeded to Istria : but the Dutch opposing the design, it was laid aside } yet the emperor made him a present of a rich diamond-ring from his finger, and honoured him with a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Presently after his return, he was sent again on the same business ; when passing through Hanover, he supped with King George I. then electoral prince, and his sister the queen of Prussia. On his arrival at Vienna, he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new for¬ tifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703 } and the same year was made pro¬ fessor of geometry in the university of Oxford, in the room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by that university. He is said to have lost the professorship of astronomy in that city, because he would not profess his belief of the Christian religion. He was scarcely settled at Oxford, when he began to translate into Latin from the Arabic, Apollo¬ nius de sectione rationis ; and to restore the two books De sectione spatii of the same author, which are lost, from the account given of them by Pappus } and he published the whole work in 1706. Afterwards he had a share in preparing for the press Apollonius’s Conics} and ventured to supply the whole eighth book, the ori¬ ginal ol which is also lost. He likewise added Serenus on tlm section of the cylinder and cone, printed from the original Greek, with a Latin translation, and pub¬ lished the whole in folio. In I7I3> he was made secretary of the Royal Society} in 17 20, he was ap¬ pointed the king’s astronomer at the royal observatory at Greenwich, in the room of Mr Flamstead ; and, in 1729, was dhosen as a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris.

Soon after, the place of master of the chapel was bestowed upon Handel; and our musician having visited his mother, who was now extremely aged and blind, and his old master Zackaw, and staid some time at the court of the Elector Palatine, set out for England, where he arrived in 1710","Hanover, George, Manchester","US,ZA",6,"United States,South Africa","North America,Africa"

These concessions, how¬ ever, he could not be prevailed upon to make ; and that he might no longer be under obligations to act as he was directed by others, he refused to enter into any engagements upon subscription. After having tried a few more operas at Covent Garden without success, he introduced another species of music called oratorios^ which he thought better suited to the native gravity of an English audience. But as the subjects of these pieces were always taken from sacred history, it was by some thought to be a profanation to set them to music and perform them at a playhouse. In consequence of this prejudice, the oratorios met with very indifferent suc¬ cess ; and in 1741 Mr Handel found his affairs in such a bad situation, that he was obliged to quit England, and go to Dublin",Dublin,"US,UK",6,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"

Behind, and on each side of the throne, there were seats for their majesties suite, maids of honour, grooms of the bed-chamber, pages, &c.—The orchestra was built at the opposite extremi¬ ty, ascending regularly from the height of seven feet from the floor to upwards of forty from the base of the pillars, and extending from the centre to the top of the side aisle.—The intermediate space below was filled up with level benches, and appropriated to the early subscri¬ bers. The side aisles were formed into long galleries ranging with the orchestra, and ascending so as to con¬ tain 12 rows on each side ; the fronts of which projected before the pillars, and were ornamented with festoons of crimson moiine.—At the top of the orchestra was placed the occasional organ, in a Gothic frame, mounting to, and mingling with, the saints and martyrs represented in the painted glass on the west window.

"HANNIBAL, a famous Carthaginian general, of whose exploits an account is given under the articles Carthage and Rome. After having had the mis¬ fortune to lose a sea-fight with the Rhodians, through the cowardice of Apollonius one of the admirals of Antiochus the Great, he was forced to fly into Crete, to avoid falling into the hands of the Romans. On his arrival in this island, he took sanctuary among the Gortynii j but as he had brought great treasure along with him, and knew the avarice of the Cretans, he thought proper to secure his riches by the following stratagem. He filled several vessels with melted lead, just covering them over with gold and silver* These he deposited in the temple of Diana, in the presence of the Gortynii, with whom, lie said, he trusted all his treasure ; Justin tells us, that he left this with them as a security for his good behaviour, and lived for some time very quietly in these parts. He took care, however, to conceal his riches in hollow statues of brass 5 which, according to some, he always carried along with him 5 or, as others will have it, exposed in a public place as things of little value. At last he retired to the court of Prusks king of Bithynia, where he found means to unite several of the neighbouring states with that prince in a confederacy against Eu* menes king of Pergamus, a professed friend to the Ro¬ mans 5 and during the ensuing war gave Eumenes se¬ veral defeats, more through the force of his own ge¬ nius than the valour of his troops* The Romans having received intelligence of the important services performed by Hannibal, immediately dispatched T","Carthage, Rome, Hannibal","US,TN",6,"United States,Tunisia","North America,Africa"

At his first audience, he complained of the protection given to that famous general; representing him 44 as the most inveterate and implacable enemy the Romans ever had y as one who had ruined both his own eountry and Antiochus, by drawing them into a destructive war with Rome.”— Prusias, in order to ingratiate himself with the Romans, immediately sent a party of soldiers to surround Han¬ nibal’s house, that he might find it impossible to make his eseape. The Carthaginian, having before disco¬ vered that no confidence was to be reposed in Prusias had contrived seven secret passages from his house, in order to evade the machinations of his enemies, even if they should earry their point at the Bithynian’eourt",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"With respect to the character of this general, it appears to have been in military affairs what Demos¬ thenes was in oratory, or Newton in mathematics j namely, absolutely perfect, in which no human wisdom could discover a fault, and to which no man could add a perfection. Rollin hath contrasted his character with that of Scipio Africanus. He enumerates the qualities which make a complete general j and having then given a summary of what historians have related concerning both commanders, is inclined to give the preference to Hannibal. “ There are, however, (be says), two difficulties which hinder him from deciding 5, one drawn from the characters of the generals whom Hannibal vanquished $ the other from the errors he committed. May it not be said (continues our author), that those victories which made Hannibal so famous, were as much owing to the imprudence and temerity of the Roman generals, as to his bravery and skill? When a Fabius and a Scipio were sent against him, the former stopped his progress, the latter conquered him.” These reasons have been answered by Mr Hooke, who bath taken some pains to vindicate Hannibal’s character, by fully and fairly comparing it with that of Scipio Africanus, and other Roman commanders","Newton, Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal, Roman, Hannibal, Roman","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"“ I do not see (says he) why these difficulties should cheek our author’s inclination to declare in favour of the Carthaginian. That Fabius was not beaten by Hannibal, we cannot much wonder, when we remem¬ ber how steadily the old man kept to his resolution never to fight with him. Bu-t from Fabius’s taking this method to put a stop to the victories of the ene- my, may we not conclude that lie knew no other, and thought Hannibal an overmatch for him ? And why does our author forget Publius Scipio (Africanus’s father), a prudent and able general, whom Hannibal vanquished at the Ticin ? Livy relates some victories of Hannibal over the celebrated Marcellas ; but nei¬ ther Marcellas nor any other general ever vanquished Hannibal before the battle of Zama, if we may be¬ lieve Polybius (lib. xv. c. 16.). Terentius Varro, in¬ deed, is represented as a headstrong rash man ; but the battle of Cann?e was not lost by his imprudence. The order Hanniba C E,'. j 111 a HAN [ 251 ] HAN mibal order in wlncli lie drew up his army is nowhere con- (1 demned ; and Chevalier Folard thinks it excellent, over. And as to the conduct of the battle, ^Flmilius Paulas, a renowned captain, and a disciple of Fabius, had a greater share in it than his colleague. The imprudence with which Varro is taxed, was his venturing, contrary to his colleague’s advice, with above 90,000 men, to en¬ counter in a plain field an enemy who had only 50,000, but was superior in horse. And does not the very advice ofiEmilius, and the charge of temerity on Varro for not following it, imply a confession of Hannibal’s superio¬ rity in military skill over ^Emilius as well as Varro ? It ought likewise to be observed, that Hannibal’s inr fantry had gained the victory over the Roman infan¬ try, before this latter suffered any thing from the Car¬ thaginian cavalry. It was otherwise when Scipio gained the victory at Zama. His infantry would pro¬ bably have been vanquished but for his cavalry. Han¬ nibal, with only his third line of foot (bis Italian army), maintained a long fight against Scipio’s three lines of foot ; and seems to have had the advantage over them, when Masinissa and Laelius, with the horse, came to their assistance. Polybius indeed says, that Hannibal’s Italian forces were equal in number to all Scipio’s in¬ fantry $ but this is contradicted by Ljvy, and is not very probable. The authority of Polybius, who was an intimate friend of Scipio ZEmilianus, is, I imagine, of little weight in matters where the glory of the Scipios is particularly concerned. His partiality and flattery to them are, in many instances, but too vi¬ sible.” Our author then proceeds to show, that Hannibal was not guilty of any of the faults laid to his charge as a general j and having contrasted the moral cha¬ racters of the two generals with each other, makes it evident, that as a man, as well as a general, Hannibal had greatly the advantage of his rival.

On his arrival in his native country, he did not immediately relinquish his mercantile con¬ nections, though he seems to have left Russia with that view. He employed himself some time as a merchant; but afterwards, more beneficially to the world, as a private gentleman.

A few years after¬ wards, when a scheme of the like kind was carried into effect, many of Mr Hanway’s ideas, thrown out in this pamphlet, were adopted.

This practice of giving vails had arrived at a very extravagant pitch, especial¬ ly among the servants of the great. It was Mr Han¬ way who answered the kind reproach of a friend in a high station for not coming oftener to dine with him, by saying, “Indeed I cannot afford it.” The Hanv nobleman to whom the above letters were addressed -y was the duke of Newcastle. The letters are written in that humorous style which is most attractive of ge¬ neral notice, and vva^ best adapted to the subject. It was Sir Timothy Waldo that first put Mr Hanway on this plan. Sir Timothy had dined with the duke of N , and, on his leaving the house, was contributing to the support and insolence of a train of servants who lined the hall ; and at last put a crown into the hand of the cook, who returned it, saying, “ Sir, I do not take silver.”—“ Don’t you indeed !” said the worthy ba¬ ronet, putting it in his pocket: “ then I do not give gold.” Among the ludicrous circumstances in Mr Hanway’s letters is one which happened to himself H e was paying the servants of a respectable friend for a dinner which their master had invited him to, one by one as they appeared j “ Sir, yopr great coat j” a shilling —“ Your hat $” a shilling—“ Stick j” a shilling  “ Umbrella 5” a shilling—” Sir, your gloves “ Why, friend, you may keep the gloves ; they are not worth a shilling.” In 1761, Mr Hanway produ¬ ced “ Reflections, Essays, and Meditations on Life and Religion j with a collection of Proverbs, and 18 Let¬ ters written occasionally on several subjects,” in 2 vols 8vo","Colchester, Halifax, Newcastle","DE,US,GB,ZA",6,"Germany,United States,United Kingdom,South Africa","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa"

At subsequent periods he continued to interest himself in various other plans for relieving the distres¬ ses, and promoting the good, of different classes of the community. His attention was particularly di¬ rected towards alleviating the miseries of young chim¬ ney-sweepers. Besides the distresses of these helpless beings, which are open to general observation, such as a contortion of the limbs, and the prevention of their growth, they are liable to a disease peculiar to their occupation, now known by the name of the chim¬ ney-sweepers cancer.

"HARLEY, Robert, earl of Oxford and Mortimer, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Harley, and born in 1661. At the Revolution, Sir Edward and his son raised a troop of horse at their own expence j and after the accession of King William and Queen Mary, he obtained a seat in parliament. His promotions were rapid. In 1702, he was chosen speaker of the house of commons j in 1704, he was sworn of Queen Anne’s privy council, and the same year made secretary of state j in 1706, he acted as one of the commissioners for the treaty of union; and in 171a was appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor and under¬ treasurer of the exeequer. A daring attempt was made on his life, March 8. 1711, by the marquis of Guiscard a French Papist; who, when under an examination be¬ fore a committee of the privy council, stabbed him with a penknife. Of this wound, however, he soon recover- HAH [ 263 ] HAH j jey ed ; and was the same year created earl of Oxford, and | lord high-treasurer, which office he resigned just before I lot. the queen’s death.

"—The word is supposed to be used for the diminutive whorelet, a “ little whore.”—Others derive it from Arietta, mistress to Robert duke of Normandy, and mother to William the Conqueror: Camden derives it from one Arlotha, concubine to William the Con¬ queror : Others from the Italian Arietta, “ a proud whore.” Harlots were tolerated amongst Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Fornication indeed was prohibited among the Jews, under severe penalties ; but those they ex¬ plained as extending only to women of their own na¬ tion. The public stews were therefore stocked with foreign prostitutes, who seem to have been taken under the protection of government. Lienee appears the rea¬ son why the word strange woman is often found to sig¬ nify a harlot. Prostitutes at first wore veils or masks ; but by and by their modesty was entirely put to flight, and they went abroad bare-faced. At Athens the pro¬ stitutes were generally strangers j and such as debauch¬ ed an Athenian female were liable to a penalty. To frequent the public stews was not held disgraceful ! The wisest of the Heathen sages allowed it ! Solon permitted common whores to go publicly to the young men who had engaged them, and encouraged the youth of A* thens to gratify their lust with these, rather than seduce Harlot, and debauch the wives or daughters of citizens.

"Amongst the Jews, the harlots used to ply in the high¬ ways and streets of cities; at Athens they frequented the ceramicus, sciros, and the old forum.—In some places they were distinguished by their dress from other women.

"The more accomplished prostitutes frequently amassed large fortunes : a remarkable instance of which we have in Phryne, who offered to rebuild the walls of Thebes, when destroyed by Alexander, on condition that they would perpetuate her memory and profession by an in¬ scription. Prostitutes at Rome u'ere obliged to fix a bill over their doors, indicating their character and pro¬ fession. It was also customary for them to change their name, after they had signified to the praetor their in¬ tention of leading such a dissolute life : this they did, because their trade was unbecoming their birth and con¬ dition ; but they reassumed their family names when they quitted their infamous mode of living.

"Though this topic appeared in itself complete in the former edition of this extensive work, yet having since received from Dr Edmund Cullen of Dublin the following observations, and reflecting that men of mu¬ sical talents have not only different tastes, but different powers of mechanical operation, we have thought it proper to submit to the choice of our readers, either Dr Franklin’s form and arrangement of the glasses, or that which was adopted by Dr Cullen ; hut in either case, we would recommend it to the initiate in this in¬ strument, to distinguish by colours, according to Dr Franklin, the notes and semitones..—We likewise can¬ not forbear to think, that the complete bass practicable on the harmonica, is by many degrees preferable to the chords with which Dr Cullen proposed to grace every emphatic f w H A R ' [ 269 ] H A R louica,emphatic note, with which, from the structure and ar- ^ rangement of his instrument, he was tinder the neces¬ sity of deluding instead of satisfying the ear, with the full effect of the regular procedure of the treble and bass upon the same instrument","Dublin, Franklin",US,6,United States,North America
"“ Let us now consider some objections that have been made to this instrument. One is, that necessity of standing, in order to do any thing capital upon it. But is not that the case in all instruments, except where the performer sits of necessity ? Did ever any one see Giardini or Fisher play a solo sitting ? But for the satisfaction of these torpid gentlemen, I can faith¬ fully assure them, I knew a lady who performed on this instrument' perfectly well, though she had lost the use of both her legs. A more serious and important ob¬ jection lies both to this and the harmonica, viz. the want of a shake. How this is supplied upon the harmo¬ nica, I cannot say, as I never saw it even attempted : but on our instrument, although a very perfect shake can scarcely be produced, something so like it may he done as will fairly excuse the want; and that is, by whirling the two stands round the note concerned with the shake with the utmost velocity, beginning the lower note a little sooner than the other. By this means, except in very large glasses where the vibrations are too distant in time, such an intermixture of the two sounds is pro¬ duced, as extremely well imitates a fine shake, and the dexterous performer will make the beat in a tuined shake with a spare finger.

"Of all the whims and paradoxes maintained by this philosopher, none is more extravagant than his as¬ sertion, that every chord, except the simple unison, is displeasing to the human ear j nay, that we are only reconciled to octaves themselves by being inured to hear them from our infancy. Strange, that nature should have fixed this invariable proportion between male and female voices, whilst at the same time she in¬ spired the hearers with such violent prepossessions against it as were invincible but by long and confirm¬ ed habit! The translator of D""1 Alembert'1 s Elements, as given under the article Music in this Dictionary, has been at peculiar pains to investigate his earliest recol¬ lections upon this subject j and has had such opportu¬ nities, both of attending to his original perceptions, and of recognising the fidelity of his memary, as are not common. He can remember, even from a period of early childhood, to have been pleased with the sim¬ plest kinds of artificial harmony ; to have distinguished the harmonics of sonorous bodies with delight j and to have been struck with horror at the sound of such bo¬ dies as, by their structure, or by the cohesion of their parts, exhibited these harmonics false. This is the chief, if not the only cause, of the tremendous and disagreeable sensation which we feel from the sound of the Chinese ghong. The same horrible cacophony is fiequently, in some degree, produced by a drum une¬ qually braced : from this sound the translator often re¬ members to have started and screamed, when carried through the streets of the town in which he was born in the arms of his nursery-maid j and as be is consci¬ ous, that the acoustic organs of many are as exquisite as his own, he cannat doubt but they may have had the same sensations, though perhaps they do not recol¬ lect the facts. So early and so nicely may the sensa¬ tions of harmony and discord be distinguished. But after all, it seems that harmony is no more than a mo- Hatm dein invention, and even at this late period only ''““v known to the Europeans. We should, however, be glad to know, from what oracle our philosopher learned that harmony was not known to antiquity. From what remains of their works, no proof of his position can be derived ; and we have at least mentioned one probabi¬ lity against it in our notes to the Preliminary Discourse to the article Music, (see note b). But though Rousseau’s mighty objections were granted, that har¬ mony can only he endured by such ears as are habi¬ tually formed and cultivated ; that the period of its prevalence has been short, and the extent of its em¬ pire limited to Europe ; still his conclusion, that it is a Gothic and barbarous invention, is not fairly deduci- ble even from these premises. Must we affirm, that epic poetry has no foundation in nature, because, du¬ ring the long interval which happened from the begin¬ ning of the world to the destruction of Troy, no epic poem seems to have appeared ? Or because a natural and mellifluous versification is less relished by an unpo¬ lished taste, than the uncouth rhimes of a common bal¬ lad, shall we infer, that the power of numbers is mere¬ ly supposititious and arbitrary ? On the contrary, we will venture to affirm, that though harmony cannot, as Rameau supposes, be mathematically demonstrated from the nature and vibrations of sonorous bodies ; vet the idea of its constituent parts, and of their coales¬ cence, is no less established, no less precise and defi¬ nite, than any mode or property of space or quantity to be investigated by geometrical researches or alge¬ braical calculations. It is certain, that the mimetic or imitative power of music chiefly consists in melody ‘7 but from this truth, however evident, it cannot be fair¬ ly deduced that harmony is absolutely unsusceptible of imitation. Perhaps every musical sound, even to the most simple, and all modulations of sound, are more or less remotely connected with some sentiment or pas¬ sion of the human heart. We know, that there are in¬ stinctive expressions of pain or pleasure in their various modes and degrees, which, when uttered by any sensi¬ tive, and perceived by any conscious being, excite in the miad of the percipient a feeling sympathetic with that by which they are prompted. We likewise know from experience, that all artificial sounds modulated in the same manner, have similar, though not equal, ef¬ fects. We have seen that, in order to render harmony compatible with itself, the melody of each part must be congenial^ and, for that reason, one kindred melo¬ dy results from the whole. So far, therefore, as any composer has it in his power to render the general me¬ lody homogeneous, so far the imitation may be preser¬ ved, and even heightened : for such objects as are ma¬ jestic and august, or the feelings which they excite, are more aptly expressed by a composition of kindred sounds, than by any simple tone whatever. Those who sup¬ pose the mimetic powers of music to be consummated in the imitation of mere unmeaning sounds or degrees of motion, must entertain limited and unworthy ideas of its province. It is naturally a representative almost of every sentiment or affection of the soul; and, when this end is gained, the art must have reached its highest perfection, and produced its noblest effects. But these effects, however sensible among the ancients, may in us be superseded by other causes which remain yet uiv- uoex'plored","Of, Troy","TR,US,CN",6,"Turkey,United States,China","Asia,North America,Asia"

Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of the privy- chamber extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great fidelity, and made use of his inte¬ rest with his friends in parliament to procure matters to be accommodated with all parties.

Beside his writings to promote republican principles, he in¬ stituted likewise a nightly meeting of several ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard, Westminster j which dub was called the Rota, and continued till the se¬ cluded members of parliament were restored by Ge¬ neral Monk.

"Harrison, John, an ingenious mechanic, the cele¬ brated inventor of the famous time-keeper for ascertain¬ ing the longitude at sea, and also of the compound, or, as it is commonly called, the gridiron-pendulum ; was born at Foulby, in the parish of Wragby, near Pontefract in Yorkshire, in 1693. The vigour of his Harrisoi natural abilities, if not even strengthened by the want of education, which confined his attention to few ob¬ jects, at least amply compensated the deficiencies of it 5 as fully appeared from the astonishing progress he made in that branch of mechanics to which he de¬ voted himself. His father was a carpenter, in which profession the son assisted •, occasionally also, according to the miscellaneous practice of country artists, sur¬ veying land, and repairing clocks and watches. Hs was, from his early childhood, attached to any ma¬ chinery moving by wheels, as appeared while he lay sick of the small pox about the sixth year of his age, when he had a watch placed open upon his pillow to amuse himself by contemplating the movement. In 1700, he removed with his lather to Barrow in Lin¬ colnshire $ where though his opportunities of acquiring knowledge were very few, he eagerly improved every incident from which he might collect information ; fre¬ quently employing all or great part of his nights in wri¬ ting or drawing : and he always acknowledged his obli¬ gations to a clergyman who came every Sunday to offi¬ ciate in the neighbourhood, who lent him a MS. copy of Professor Saunderson’s Lectures; which he carefully and neatly transcribed, with all the diagrams. His na¬ tive genius exerted itself superior to these solitary dis¬ advantages ; for in the year 1726, he had constructed two clocks, mostly of wood, in which he applied the escapement and compound pendulum of his own inven¬ tion : these surpassed every thing then made, scarcely erring a second in a month. In 1728, he came up to London with the drawings of a machine for deter¬ mining the longitude at sea, in expectation of being enabled to execute one by the board of longitude","Harrison, Pontefract, London","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Upon application to Dr Halley, he referred him to Mr George Graham; who, discovering he had un¬ common merit, advised him to make his machine be¬ fore he applied to the board of longitude. He re¬ turned home to perform this task ; and in 1735 came to London again with his first machine ; with which he was sent to Lisbon the next year for a trial of its properties. In this short voyage, he corrected the dead reckoning about a degree and a half; a success that proved the means of his receiving both public and private encouragement. About the year I739> he completed his second machine, of a construction much more simple than the former, and which an¬ swered much better; this, though not sent to sea, recommended Mr Harrison yet stronger to the pa¬ tronage of his private friends and of the public","Graham, London, Lisbon","US,GB,PT",6,"United States,United Kingdom,Portugal","North America,Europe,Europe"
"H is third machine, which he produced in 1749, was still less complicated than the second, and superior in accuracy, as erring only three or four seconds in a week. This he conceived to be the ne plus ul¬ tra of his attempts ; but in an endeavour to improve pocket-watches, he found the principles he applied to surpass his expectations so much, as to encourage him to make his fourth time-keeper, which is in the form of a pocket watch, about six inches diameter. With this time-keeper his son made two voyages, the one to Jamaica, and the other to Barbadoes: in both which experiments it corrected the longitude within the nearest limits required by the act of the 12th of Queen Anne; and the inventor therefore, at different times, though not, without infinite trouble, received * ' the H A n [ 281 ] H A R rison, the proposed reward of 20,oool. These four ma- )gate. chines were given up to the board of longitude. The three former were not of any use, as all the advanta¬ ges gained by making them were comprehended in the last ; they were worthy, however, of being carefully preserved as mechanical curiosities, in which might be traced the gradations of ingenuity executed with the most delicate workmanship j whereas they now lie totally neglected in the royal observatory at Green¬ wich. The fourth machine, emphatically distinguished by the name of the time-keeper, has been copied by the ingenious Mr Kendal ; and that duplicate, during a three years circumnavigation of the globe in the southern hemisphere by Captain Cook, answered as well as the original. The latter part of Mr Harri¬ son’s life was employed in making a fifth improved time-keeper on the same principles with the prece¬ ding one ; which, at the end of a ten weeks trial, in 1772, at the king’s private observatory at Richmond, erred only 4^ seconds.

H HEBRON, in Ancient Geography, a very ancient city, situated in the hilly country of the tribe of Judah to the south. Its more ancient name was Kiriath Ar- ba, or Cariath Arba. In antiquity this city vied with most ancient cities of Egypt, being seven years prior to Zoan, translated Tanis by the Seventy. Jo¬ sephus makes it not only older than Tanis, but even than Memphis. It stood to the west of the lake Asphal- tites, and was for some time the royal residence of D avid. After the captivity it fell into the hands of the Edomites, as did all the south country of Judea. It is now called Habroun, situated seven leagues to the south of Bethlehem. The Arabs call it El-kalil, “ the well- beloved which is the epithet they usually apply to Abraham, whose sepulchral grotto they still show* Habroun is seated at the foot of an eminence, on which are some wretched ruins, the mishapen remains of an ancient castle. The adjacent country is a sort of ob¬ long hollow, five or six leagues in length, and not dis¬ agreeably varied by rocky hillocks, groves of fir-trees, stunted oaks, and a few plantations of vines and olive trees. These vineyards are not cultivated with a view to make wine, the inhabitants being such zealous Maho¬ metans as not to permit any Christians to live among them : they are only of use to procure dried raisins, which are badly prepared, though the grapes are of au excellent kind. The peasants cultivate cotton likewise, which is spun by their wives, and sold at Jerusalem and Gaza. They have also some soap manufactories, the kali for which is sold them by the Bedouins ; and a very ancient glass-house, the only one in Syria. They make there a great quantity of coloured rings, brace¬ lets for the wrists and legs, and for the arms above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to Constantinople. In consequence of these manufactures, Mr Volney informs us, Habroun is the most powerful village in all this quarter; and is able to arm 800 or 900 men, who adhere to the faction Kaisi, and are the perpetual enemies of the people of Beth¬ lehem. This discord, which has prevailed throughout the country from the earliest times of the Arabs, causes a perpetual civil war. The peasants are incessantly ma¬ king inroads on each other’s lands, destroying their corn, dourra, sesamum, and olive trees, and carrying off their sheep, goats, and camels. The Turks, who are everywhere negligent in repressing similar disorders, are the less attentive to them here, since their autho¬ rity is very precarious. The Bedouins, whose camps occupy the level country, are continually at open ho¬ stilities with them ; of which the peasants avail them¬ selves to resist their authority, or do mischief to each other, according to the blind caprice of their igno¬ rance or the interest of the moment.

Here the duke of Montagu, artfully addressing himself to him, told him, “ The king was in a violent passion ; that his best way was to go instantly and make an apology, for certainly the musicians were mad, and af¬ terwards to discharge them. Almost at the same instant, he ordered the false Heidegger to do the same. The scene, now became truly comic in the circle before the king. Heidegger had no sooner made a genteel apology for the insolence of his musicians, but the false Heidegger advanced, and in a plaintive tone, cried out, “ Indeed, Sire, it was not my fault but that devil’s in my likeness.” Poor Heidegger turned round, stared, staggered, grew pale, and could not utter a word. The duke then humanely whispered in his ear the sum of his plot, and the counterfeit was ordered to take off his mask.

This advantage then arises from the shortness of the lever upon which the action of the water xs im¬ pressed, and the great comparative length of the tiller, or lever, by which the rudder is, governed ; together with the additional power of the wheel that directs the movements of the tiller, and still farther accumulates the power of the helmsman over it.

Instead of examining systems of legislation, and comparing them with each other, Helvetius was of opinion, that the nature of man should be first studied, and the laws for governing him founded on his own nature.

Henault introduced him to the abbe Bignon, and this was the first step of his illustrious course. In 1713 he brought a tragedy on the stage, under the dis¬ guised name of Fuselier. As he was known to the pub¬ lic only by some slighter pieces, “ Cornelia the Vestal” met with no better success. He therefore locked it up without printing. In his old age his passion for these subjects reviving, and Mr Horace Walpole being at Paris in 1768, and having formed a friendship with him as one of the most amiable men of his nation, obtained this piece, and had it printed at his own press.

In this year Henry de¬ clared war against France, gained the battle of Spurs, and took the towns of Terouenne and lournay3 but before he embarked his troops, he beheaded the earl of Suffolk, who had been long confined in the Tower.

"His majesty being once more at liberty to indulge himself with another wife, fixed upon Catharine How¬ ard, niece to the duke of Norfolk. She was declared queen in August 1540 j but they had been privately married some time before. Henry, it seems, was so entirely satisfied with this lady, that he daily blessed God for his present felicity ; but that felicity was of short duration : he had not been married above a year, before the queen was accused of frequent prostitution, both before and since her marriage: she confessed her guilt, and was beheaded in February 1542. In July 1543» ,ie married his sixth wife, the lady Catharine Parr, the widow of John Nevil Lord Latimer, and lived to the year 1547 without committing any more flagrant enormities: but finding himself now approach towards dissolution, he made his will 5 and that the last scene of his life might resemble the rest, he deter¬ mined to end the tragedy with the murder of two of his best friends and most faithful subjects, the duke of Norfolk and his son the earl of Surrey. The earl was beheaded on the 19th of January j and the duke was ordered for execution on the 29th j but fortunate¬ ly escaped by the king’s death on the 28th. They were condemned without the shadow of a crime ; but Henry’s political reason for putting them to death, was his apprehension that, if they were suflered to survive him, they would counteract some of his regu¬ lations in religion, and might be troublesome to his Henry, son.

Bishop Burnet says, “ be was rather to be reckoned among the great than the good princes.” He afterwards ac¬ knowledges, that “ he is to be numbered among the ill princes •, but adds, “ I cannot rank him with the worst.” Sir Walter Raleigh, with infinitely more justice, says, “ If all the pictures and patterns of a merciless prince were lost to the world, they might again be painted to the life out of the history of this king.” He was indeed a merciless tyrant, a scurvy politician, a foolish bigot, a horrible assassin.

"With regard to the authenticity of his histories, Major informs us only that he “ does not believe every thing that he finds in such writings 5” but from other testimonies it appears, that he consulted the very best authorities which could at that time he had. Though, according to the most early account of Henry, it ap¬ pears to have been at least 56 years after the death of Wallace that Henry was born 5 yet he is said to have consulted with several of the descendants of those who had been the companions of that hero while he achie¬ ved his most celebrated exploits, and who were still capable of ascertaining the veracity of what he publish¬ ed. The principal of these were Wallace of Craigie and Liddle of that ilk ; who, he says, persuaded him to omit in his history a circumstance which he ought to have inserted. Besides these, he consulted with the principal people of the kingdom ; and he utterly dis¬ claims the idea of having adhered entirely to any un¬ written tradition, or having been promised any reward for what he wrote. His chief authority, according to his own account, W’as a Latin history of the exploits of Sir William, written partly by Mr John Blair and partly by Mr Thomas Gray, who had been the com¬ panions of the hero himself. Henry’s account of these two authors, is to the following purpose : “ They be¬ came acquainted with Wallace when the latter was 9 1 HEN only about 16 years of age, and at that time a student Henry, at the school of Dundee ; and their acquaintance with * him continued till his death, which happened in his 29th year. Mr John Blair went from the schools in Scotland to Paris, where he studied some time, and received priests orders. He returned to Scotland in 1296, where he joined Wallace, who was bravely as¬ serting the liberties of his country. Mr Thomas Gray, who was parson of Libberton, joined Wallace at the same time. They were men of great wisdom and in¬ tegrity, zealous for the freedom of Scotland; and were present with Wallace, and assisting to him, in most of nia military enterprises.

"I he bishop, if he had lived longer, was to have sent their book to Rome, for the purpose of obtaining the sanction of the pope’s authority.” > Ihe book which Henry thus appeals to as Ills prin¬ cipal authority is now lost, so that we have no oppor¬ tunity of comparing it with what he has written. The character given by Dempster of Henry, however, is more favourable than that by Major. He tells us, that “be was blind from bis birth; a man of singular happy genius ; he was indeed another Homer. He did great honour to his native country, and raised it above what was common to it in his age. He wrote, in the ver¬ nacular verse, an elaborate and grand work, in ten books, of the deeds of William Wallace.” In this account there is a mistake ; for the poem contains eleven or twelve books ; but Dempster, who wrote in a foreign country, and had not a printed copy of Henry’s work by him when he wrote his eulogium, is excusable in a mistake of this kind",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"of Scotland by his queen Anne sister of the king of Denmark, and one of the most accomplished princes of the age in which he lived, was born on the 19th of February 1594* The birth of the prince was announ¬ ced by embassies to many foreign powers, with invi¬ tations to be present at the ceremony of his baptism, which was thus delayed for a considerable time. Mr Peter Young, who, along with the celebrated George Buchanan, had been preceptor to his majesty, was sent to the courts of Denmark, Brunswic, and Meck¬ lenburg, the duke of Mecklenburg being great-grand¬ father to the prince by the mother’s side ; the laird of East ""Weems to France and England ; and Sir Robert Kieith, and Captain Murray provost of St Andrew’s, 2: to the States General, who at that time were strug¬ gling against the Spanish tyranny, and not yet declared a free state. All these ambassadors were cordially re¬ ceived, and others appointed in return except by the courts of France and England. Henry IV. at that time king of France, though the Scots ambassador had formerly been one of his own servants, neither made any present, nor appointed an ambassador. Queen Elizabeth had designed to act in the same manner till she heard of the behaviour of Henry 5 after which she honoured James by appointing an ambassador of very high rank, Robert earl of Sussex. This ambassador, however, was so long of making his appearance, that the queen imagined the ceremony would be over before his arrival; for which reason she sent a message to the earl, commanding him in that case not to enter Scot¬ land nor deliver her present. But James had been more obsequious $ and not only delayed the ceremony till the English ambassador arrived, but distinguished him from the rest by having a canopy carried over his head at the procession, supported by the lairds of Cess- ford, Buccleugh, Duddope, and Traquair. The ce¬ remony was performed with great magnificence j after which the ambassadors presented their gifts. That from the United States was the most valuable. It consisted of two gold cups worth 12,400 crowns, with a box of the same metal, weighing in all about 400 ounces, containing besides the grant of a pension of 5000 florins annually to the prince for life. The Eng¬ lish ambassador gave a cupboard of plate curiously wrought, and valued at 3000I. sterling j and the Danish ambassador two gold chains, one for the queen and another for the prince.

"In his seventh year, Prince Henry began his corre¬ spondence with foreign powers. His first letter was to the States of Holland 5 in which he expressed his regard and gratitude for the good opinion they had conceived of him, and of which he had been informed by HEN [ 381 ] HEN by several persons who had visited that country; con- ' eluding with a request that they would make use of his interest with his father in whatever he could serve them, promising also his service in every other respect in which he could be useful, until he should be able to give farther instances of his good-will and affection",Holland,US,6,United States,North America
"In all his exercises he made surprising progress ; and not only in those of the military kind, but in singing, dancing, &c. On his ninth birth-day he sent a letter in Latin to the king, informing him that he had read over Terence’s Hecyra, the third book of Phaedrus’s Fables, and two books of Cicero’s Epistles j and that now he thought himself capable of performing some¬ thing in the commendatory kind of epistles. His ac¬ complishments were soon spoken of in foreign countries j and these, along with the general suspicion that James favoured the Catholic party, probably induced Pope Clement VIII. to make an attempt to get him into his hands. With this view he proposed, that if James would entrust him with the education of the young prince, he would advance such sums of money as would effectually establish him on the throne of England",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"This happened a little before the death of Elizabeth j but James, notwithstanding his ambition to possess the crown of England, of which he was not yet altogether certain, withstood the temptation. He alleged, that it would be unnatural for him, as a father, to allow his son to be brought up in the belief of a doctrine which he himself did not believe : and even though he should act in his private capacity in such an unnatural manner, he could not answer for it to the nation, he being heir-apparent to the crown, and the kingdom at large much interested in whatever concerned him. On the death of the queen of England, James was obliged to leave Scotland in such haste, that he had not time to take a personal leave of his son, and therefore did so by letter, which was answered by the prince in Latin",Elizabeth,US,6,United States,North America
"In the month of July this year (1603) Prince Henry was invested with the order of the Garter ; after which he was presented to the queen in his robes, and greatly commended by all who saw him on account cf his majestic carriage and religious behaviour at the altar, as well as the quickness of his understanding and ready answers. Being obliged to leave London on account of the plague, he retired to Otelands, a royal palace near Weybridge in Surrey, where a sepa¬ rate household was appointed for him and his sister Elizabeth. The appointment consisted at first of 70 servants, of whom 22 were to be above stairs and 48 below. In some weeks the number was augmented to 104, of whom 51 were above stairs and 53 below; but before the end of the year they were augmented to 141, of whom 56 were above stairs and 85 below","London, Weybridge, Surrey, Elizabeth","GB,CA,US",6,"United Kingdom,Canada,United States","Europe,North America,North America"

"Prince Henry now began to show himself equally a patron of military men and of learning. His martial disposition induced him to take notice of Colonel Ed- mondes, a brave Scots officer in the Dutch service, who had raised himself solely by his merit. To him he applied for a suit of armour to be sent over from Holland : but though the colonel executed his com¬ mission, he reaped no benefit from his highness’s fa¬ vour, dying in a short time after the armour was pur¬ chased, before he had any opportunity of sending it over. In matters of literature the prince appears to have been a very good judge. He patronized divines, and appears to have been naturally of a religious turn of mind. His attachment to the Protestant religion ap¬ pears to have been excessive ; as it never was in the power of the queen, who favoured the Catholic party, to make the least impression upon him. Her machina¬ tions for this purpose were discovered by the Irench ambassador; who, in a letter dated June 7. 1604, informed his master of them, and that the Spaniards were in hopes of being able by her means to alter the religion in England, as well as to prejudice the prince against France, which the queen said she hoped that her son would one day he able to conquer like another Henry V. By another letter, of date 22d October the ■* HEN [ 382 ] HEN ncniy. same year, the ambassador, after taking notice of the -y. i. ,.i queen’s immoderate ambition, adds, that she used all her efforts to corrupt the mind of the prince, by flat¬ tering his passions, diverting him from his studies, and representing to him, out of contempt to his father, that learning was inconsistent with the character of a great general and conqueror j proposing at the same time a marriage with the infanta of Spain. Notwithstanding these remonstrances, however, the prince continued to behave as usual, and to patronise the learned no less than before. He presented John Johnston, one of the king’s professors at St Andrew’s with a diamond, lor having dedicated to him an Historical Description of the kings of Scotland from the foundation of the mo¬ narchy to that time ; after which the professor added a carmen encomiasticum, which was transmitted to his highness in November 1605. Many other authors also sought and obtained his countenance. In j6c6 Mr John Bond ushered his edition of Horace into the world with a polite dedication to the prince, whom he highly compliments on account ol the progress he had made in learning. In 1609 a book was sent over to him from France by Sir George Carew, the Bri¬ tish ambassador there, tending to disprove the doctrine of the Catholics concerning the church of Rome being the first of the Christian churches. The same year the learned Thomas Tydyat published his Emendatio Ecm- gorum, which appeared under the patronage ot the prince; and with this performance his highness was so well pleased, that he took the author into his family to read to him, and made him his chronographer and cosmographer. Paul Buys or Busius also sent him a letter with a dedication of the second part of his Pan¬ dects; in which he bestows upon him the highest com¬ pliments on the great expectations which were formed of him, and of the hopes entertained by the reformed Christian churches that he would prove a powerful sup¬ port to their cause, and antagonist to the errors of Rome. In 1611 Dr Tooker, in his dedication of an Answer to Becanus a Jesuit, who had written agnlnst a piece done by his majesty himself, styles his highness 4* the Maecenas of all the learned.” Another treatise against the same Becanus was also printed this year, and dedicated to the prince","Holland, Rome, Rome","US,FR,ES,NL",6,"United States,France,Spain,Netherlands","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Many other authors, whom our limits will not allow us to take notice of, were fond of dedicating their per¬ formances to his highness ; nor was his correspondence less extensive than his erudition.

"On the same occasion also Lord Spenser wrote him a letter, accompanying it with the present of a sword and target; “ instruments (says he) fit to be about you in those treacherous times ; from the which, I trust, God will ever protect your most royal father, &c.” Previous to this he had corresponded in Latin with the doge of Venice, the landgrave of Hesse, and the king of Den¬ mark ; in French with the duke of Savoy, and in La¬ tin with the duke of Brunswic and Uladislaus Ling of Poland ; besides a number of other eminent persons too tedious to enumerate",Venice,"PL,US,FR",6,"Poland,United States,France","Europe,North America,Europe"
"_ The great accomplishments of Henry soon caused him to be taken notice of by the most eminent princes in Europe. In 1606 Henry IV. of France ordered jjcni his ambassador to pay him special regard on all occa--y sions. He desired him likewise to salute the prince in the name of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII. and to inform him of the regard the latter had for him. A message was also sent by the same ambassador to M. de St Anthoine, appointed to be riding-master to his high¬ ness, enjoining him to do his duty in that office: and assuring him that his majesty would be as much pleased with it as if the service had been done to himself. To these messages the prince returned very proper answers; and afterwards performed his exercise in the riding- school before the ambassador himself, that the latter might send an account thereof to his master. On this occasion he mounted two horses, and acquitted himself so well that the ambassador in a letter to M. de Ville- roy, the French secretary, gave him the character of “ a prince who promised very much, and whose friend¬ ship could not but be one day of advantage.” Flaving then set forth the propriety of cultivating a good under¬ standing with him, he tells the secretary, that the dau¬ phin might make a return for some dogs which the prince had sent him, by a suit of armour well gilt and enamelled, together with pistols and a sword of the same kind ; also two horses, one of them a barb.— This year also the prince waited on his uncle the king of Denmark, who had come to England on a visit to King James ; and this monarch was so much pleased with his company, that he presented him at parting with his vice-admiral and best fighting ship, valued at no less than 2500I. also with a rapier and hanger, va¬ lued at 2000 marks. The states of Holland were equally ready to show their attachment. On the 25th of Au¬ gust this year they sent a letter to the prince in French, accompanied with the present of a set of table-linen, which they thought, as being the produce of their own country, would be agreeable to him ; and they requested his love and favour towards their state : in return for which they promised to be always ready to show their regard for him, and to do him all possible service ; as the ambassador himself was ordered more particularly to declare. About this time the prince himself wrote a letter to Henry IV. acknowledging the kindness which his majesty had shown him for se¬ veral years, and confirmed of late by the latter offering him under his own royal hand his friendship and that of the dauphin",Holland,"FR,DK,US",6,"France,Denmark,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"Under this year, 1611, the elegant Latin historian of Great Britain from 1572 to 1628, Robert Johnston, places a story, which, though unsupported by any au¬ thority but his own, and improbable in itself, must not be omitted here. The prince, according to this writer, requested the king that he might be appointed to preside in the council. This demand was seconded by the king’s favourite, Car Viscount Rochester, who urged his majesty to lay his son’s request before the council. But the earl of Salisbury, jealous of the growing power of Rochester, and a thorough master of artifice and dissimulation, used all his efforts to de¬ feat whatever measures were proposed by his rival and being asked soon after his opinion upon this point, whether it was for the public interest that the prince should preside in the council, answered, that he thought it dangerous to divide the government, and to invest the son with the authority of the father. Many others of the privy council having delivered their opinions on the same question, that ol the earl of Salisbury was adopted by the majority. But his lordship soon took an opportunity, in a secret conference with the prince, to lament his own situation, and to persuade his big! - I ness that Lord Rochester had the only influence in the palace, and privately counteracted all his designs. The prince, on his part, resented the denial of his request, and his exclusion from public business. It was not long before Lord Rochester discovered the earl of Sa¬ lisbury’s practice against him with the prince j to whom he therefore went to clear himself-, but his high¬ ness turned from him with great indignation, and would not hear his justification. The queen likewise, highly displeased with the viscount, refused to see him, and sought all means of lessening his power. This forwardness imputed to the prince by the historian, in endeavouring to intrude himself into the management of public affairs, is not (as Dr Birch remarks) at all suitable to the character of his highness, or to any other accounts which we have of him ; nor ought it to be believed upon the credit of a writer who cites no authority for it, nor indeed for scarce any other assertions in his history, how extraordinary so ever they appear to he, and who frequently ventures to enlarge upon subjects which it was impossible for him to have known. However, it is not much to be doubted, that the prince had no great esteem for Lord Rochester, whose rise to the power of a favourite and a minister he so much disliked, if we may believe a satirical writer of Memoirs *, that he was reported either to have* Fi ; struck his lordship on the back with a racket, or very hardly forborne it. And another historian, not much ^^, 5 less satirical, Arthur Wilson f, mentions the bicker-^ /A ings betwixt the prince and the viscount; and that Sir jaw James Elphinston one day observing his highness to be sect. • discontented with the viscount, offered to kill him ; f°r^ which the prince reproved him, and said that if thereby were cause he would do it himself. But to wave suchjf jifs 1 very suspicious authorities, it will be sufficient, in order to judge of his highness’s opinion of the viscount, and his administration at the very height of it,^ to hear what himself says in a letter to Sir Thomas Ldmondes ot HEN [ 387 ] HEN of the loth of September 1612; “As matters go now here, I will deal in no businesses of importance for some respects.” It is not to Ge supposed but that the marriage of a prince so accomplished and so much admired would en¬ gage the attention of the public. This was indeed the case. The queen, who favoured the interest of Spain, proposed a match with the infanta, and the king of Spain himself seemed to be inclined to the match. In 1611 a proposal was made for a double marriage be¬ twixt the prince of Wales and the eldest daughter of the house of Savoy, and between the prince of Savoy and the lady Elizabeth j but these overtures were very coolly received, being generally disagreeable to the nation. Sir Walter Raleigh, at that time prisoner in the Tower, wrote two excellent treatises against these matches •, in one of which he styles the prince The most excellent and hopeful, as he does also in the introduction to his Observations on the royal navy and sea-service. About the year 1612, his marriage be¬ came an object of general attention. In this aflair the king seems to have inclined to match his son with the princess who promised to bring the largest dowry y the nation at large to have been influenced by motives of religion ; and the prince himself to have remained en¬ tirely passive, and to have been willing to bestow his person with the most perfect indifference on whatso¬ ever princess should be chosen for him. This appears from a letter to the king dated 5th October 1612, in which he considers the match with the second princess of France as in a manner concluded. Proposals had indeed been made of sending her over to England for her education, she being only nine years of age at that time 5 but Villeroy the French minister was of opi¬ nion, that this ought to be delayed for a year longer","Rochester, Salisbury, Rochester, Salisbury, Elizabeth, Raleigh","US,ES,FR",6,"United States,Spain,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Prince Henry, notwithstanding his indifference in matrimonial matters, applied himself with the utmost assiduity to his former employments and exercises, the continual fatigue of which was thought to impair his health. In the 19th year of his age his constitution seemed to undergo a remarkable change : be began to appear pale and thin, and to be more retired and se¬ rious than usual. He complained now and then of a giddiness and heavy pain in his forehead, which ob¬ liged him to stroke up his brow before he put on his hat: he frequently hied at the nose, which gave great relief, though the discharge stopped some time before his death. These forebodings of a dangerous malady were totally neglected both by himself and his attend¬ ants, even after he began to be seized at intervals with fainting fits. Notwithstanding these alarming symp¬ toms, lie continued his usual employments. On the arrival of Count de Nassau in England, he waited upon him as though nothing had been the matter 5 and when the subject of the princess Elizabeth’s mar¬ riage came to be canvassed, he interested himself deeply in the affair, and never desisted till the match with the elector palatine was concluded. In the beginning of June 16x2, the prince went to Richmond, where he continued till the progress : and notwithstanding the complaints above mentioned, he now took the oppor¬ tunity of the neighbourhood of the Thames to learn to swim. This practice in an evening, and after sup¬ per, was discommended by several of his attendants j and was supposed to have stopped the bleeding at the nose, from which he had experienced such salutary eft’ects. He could not, however, be prevailed upon to discontinue the practice ; and took likewise great pleasure in walking by the river side in moon-light to hear the sound and echo of the trumpets, by which he was undoubtedly too much exposed to the evening dews. Through impatience to meet the king his fa¬ ther, he rode 60 miles in one day ; and having rested himself during the night, he rode the next day 36 miles to Belvoir Castle, where lie met the king at the time appointed. Dining the heat of the season also he made several other fatiguing journeys, which must undoubtedly have contributed to impair his health","Elizabeth, Richmond","US,ZA",6,"United States,South Africa","North America,Africa"
"HEN [ 388 ] HEN Henry, conceal it, and occupied himself as usual j only that ■“■""'v now, instead of rising early in the morning as before, he would commonly keep his bed till nine. On the 10th of that month he had two slight fits of an ague, which obliged him to keep his chamber ; and on the 13th his distemper seemed to be augmented by a vio¬ lent diarrhoea, which, however, gave so much relief next day, that he insisted upon being removed from Richmond to St James’s, in order to receive the elec¬ tor palatine. On his arrival there, some of his attend¬ ants began to be alarmed by the signs of sickness which appeared upon him, though he himself made no complaint, and even allowed his physician to go to his own house. The elector arrived on the 16th, and the prince waited upon him at Whitehall $ but his disease had now gained so much ground, that his temper un¬ derwent a very considerable alteration, and he became peevish and discontented with almost every thing: nevertheless he still continued to give orders about what related to the ceremony of his sister’s marriage j and kept company as much as he could with the elector and the count de Nassau, with whose conversation he seemed to be particularly delighted. So great was his activity even at this time, that he played a match at tennis on the 24th of October. At this time he expo¬ sed himself in his shirt, seemingly without any inconve¬ nience; but at night he complained of a greater degree of lassitude than usual, and of a pain in his head. Next day, being Sunday, he attended divine service, and heard two sermons ; after which he dined with his ma¬ jesty, seemingly with a good appetite, but the paleness and ghastly appearance of his countenance were much remarked. About three in the afternoon he was obliged to yield to the violence of his distemper; being seized with a great faintness, shivering, and headach, with other symptoms of a fever, which from that time never left him","Richmond, Whitehall, Nassau","ZA,US,BS",6,"South Africa,United States,Bahamas","Africa,North America,North America"

"Though he loved plenty and magnificence in his house, he restrained them within the rules of frugality and moderation, as we have already noticed. ■ By this economy he avoided the necessity of being rigid to his tenants, either by raising their farms or fines, or seek¬ ing or taking advantage of forfeitures. Nor was he tempted to make the profit which both law and right afforded him, of such who had in the time of former princes purchased lands belonging to his duchy of Cornwall, which could not by law be alienated from it j for he gave them, upon resuming these lands, a reasonable satisfaction. Neither did his economy re¬ strain him from being liberal where merit or distress called for it j at the same time he was never known to give, or even promise, any thing, but upon mature de¬ liberation. Whatever abuses were represented to him, he immediately redressed, to the entire satisfaction of the persons aggrieved. In his removal from one of his houses to another, and in his attendance on the king on the same occasions, or in progresses, he would suffer no provisions or carriages to be taken up for his use, without full contentment given to the parties.

"With regard to any unlawful passion for women, to the temptations of which the prince’s youth and situa¬ tion peculiarly exposed him, his historian, who knew him, and observed him much, assures us, that having been present at great feasts made in the prince’s house, to which he invited the most beautiful ladies ot the court and city, he could not discover by his highness’s behaviour, eyes, or countenance, the least appearance of a particular inclination to any one of themnor was he at any other time witness of such words or ac¬ tions as could justly be a ground of the least suspicion of his virtue; though he observes, that some persons of that time, measuring the prince by themselves, were pleased to conceive and report otherwise of him. It is indeed asserted by the writer of Anlicus Coquinarice, believed upon good grounds to be William Saunder- son, Esq. author of the “ Complete History of Mary Queen of Scotland, and her son and successor King James,” that the prince made court to the countess ol Essex (afterwards divorced from the earl, and married to the viscount Rochester), before any other lady then living. And Arthur Wilson mentions the many amo¬ rous glances which the prince gave her, till discover¬ ing that she was captivated with the growing fortunes of Lord Rochester, and grounded more hope upon him than the uncertain and hopeless love of his highness, he soon slighted her. The learned and pious antiqua¬ ry, Sir Simonds D’Ewes, in a manuscript life of him¬ self, written with his own hand, and brought down to the year 1637, is positive, that, “ notwithstanding the inestimable Prince Henry’s martial desires and initia¬ tion into the ways of godliness, the countess, being set on by tbe earl of Northampton her father’s uncle, first caught his eye and heart, and afterwards prosti¬ tuted herself to him, who first reaped the fruits of her virginity. But those sparks of grace which even then began to show their lustre in him, w’th those more he¬ roic innate qualities derived from virtue, which gave the law to his more advised actions, soon raised him out of the slumber of that distemper, and taught him to reject her following temptations with indignation and superciliousness.” But these authorities, Dr Birdi observes, ought to have little weight to the prejudice of the prince’s character, against the direct testimony in his favour from so well informed a writer as Sir Charles Cornwallis","Mary, Essex, Rochester, Wilson, Northampton","US,TM",6,"United States,Turkmenistan","North America,Asia"
"The immature death of the prince concurring with the public apprehensions of the powrer of the papists, and the ill opinion which the nation then had of the court, gave immediate rise to suspicions of its being hastened by poison. And these suspicions were height¬ ened by the very little concern shown by some persons in great stations. “ To tell you (says Richard earl of Dorset in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes, ot the 23 d HEN [ 39i ] HEN lem-y. of November 1612) that our rising sun is set ere scarcely he had shone, and that with him all our glory lies buried, you know and do lament as well as we, and better than some do, and more truly; or else you are not a man, and sensible of this kingdom’s loss.” And it is certain, that this loss made so little impression up¬ on the king and his favourite, that the lord viscount Kochester on the 9th of November, three days after it, wrote to Sir Thomas Edmondes to begin a nego- eiation for a marriage between Prince Charles and the second daughter of France. But the ambassador, who had more sense of decency, thought it improper to en¬ ter upon such an affair so soon after the late prince’s death. Mr Beaulieu, secretary to Sir Thomas Ed¬ mondes, in a letter of the I2th of November 1612, to Mr Trumbull, then resident at Brussels, after styling the prince “ the flower of his house, the glory of his country, and the admiration of all strangers, which in all places had imprinted a great hope on the minds of the well affected, as it had already stricken terror into the hearts of his enemies,” adds, “ who perhaps (for of this lamentable accident we have yet no particular relation) fearing the growing virtues of that young prince, have used the traiterous venom of their abomi¬ nable practices to cut him off' in his youth. And this I do not apprehend without cause, considering the seve¬ ral advertisements which I saw a month ago coming out of England, Holland, and Calais, of strange rumours which were in these parts, of some great and imminent practice in hand, for the success whereof it was written, that in some places our adversaries had made solemn prayers : and out of Calais it was especially advertised, that in your parts they were in expectation of the death of some great prince. But,, alas ! we did little appre¬ hend, that such ominous prognostications would have lighted upon the person of that vigorous young prince, whose extraordinary great parts and virtues made many men hope and believe, that God had reserved and des¬ tined him, as a chosen instrument, to be the standard- bearer of his quarrel in these miserable times, to work the restoration of his church, and the destruction of the Romish idolatry","Brussels, Holland, Calais, Calais","FR,BE,US",6,"France,Belgium,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"With the above notion his royal highness’s mother the queen was peculiarly impressed, according to Dr Welwood ; who, in his Notes on Arthur Wilson’s Life of King James I. in the Complete History of England, p. 714. informs us, though without giving any authority, that when the prince fell into his last illness, the queen sent to Sir Walter Raleigh for some iff' his cordials, which she herself had taken some time before in a fever with remarkable success. Raleigh sent it, together with a letter to the queen, wherein he expressed a tender concern for the prince j and, boasting of his medicine, stumbled unluckily upon an expression to this purpose, “ that it would certainly cure him or any other of a lever, except in case ot poison."""" As the prince took this medicine, and e.ied notwithstanding its virtues, the queen, in the agony of her grief, showed Raleigh’s letter j and laid so much c weight on the expression about poison, that as long as she lived she could never he persuaded hut that the cte, prince had died by that means. Sir Anthony Weldon * «W<*, suggests that the prince was poisoned. The same no- 77- 78. lion is countenanced by Wilson in his History f- j and '^•'’J-was adopted by Dr Welwood, as already mentioned: Who likewise, in another work, his Memoirs, after Henry, styling the prince “ the darling of mankind, and a *»—-y—— youth of vast hopes and wonderful virtues,” remarks, that it was the general rumour at the time of his death, that his highness was poisoned ; and that there is in print a sermon preached at St James’s upon the disso¬ lution of his family, that boldly insinuated some such thing. By this sermon Dr Welwood must mean that of Mr Hall cited above * in which, however, at least as it is reprinted in the .London edition of his works in 1617, in folio, there is not to be found any expres¬ sion that carries the least insinuation of that kind. The writer of the memoirs adds, that Sir Francis Bacon, in his speech at the trial of the earl of Somerset, had some reflections upon the intimacy of that lord with Sir Thomas Overbury, which seemed to point that way \ there being several expressions left out of the printed copy that were in the speech. Bishop Burnet likewise tells us, that he was assured by Colonel Titus, that he had heard King Charles I. declare, that the prince his brother was poisoned by the means of the viscount Rochester, afterwards earl of Somerset. But it will be perhaps sufficient to oppose to all such sug¬ gestions the unanimous opinion of physicians who at¬ tended the prince during his sickness, and opened his body after his death ; from which, as Dr Welwood him¬ self observes, there can be no inference drawn that he was poisoned. To which may be added the authority of Sir Charles Cornwallis J, who was well informed, t Life an^ and above all suspicion in this point, and who pronoun- l?Tcatfi, ces the rumours spread of his highness’s having been ^ poisoned vain 5 and was fully convinced that his death was natural, and occasioned by a violent fever","Raleigh, Raleigh, Raleigh, Wilson, London, Somerset, Rochester, Somerset","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

As to hereditary arms of families, Wil¬ liam Camden, Sir Henry Spelman, and other judici¬ ous heralds, agree, that they began no sooner than to¬ wards the latter end of the nth century.

Moreover, this last author asserts, that with tournaments first came up coats-of-arms ; which were a sort of livery, made up of sevei-al lists, fillets, or narrow pieces of stuff of divers colours, from whence came the fess, the bend, the pale, &c. which were the original charges of family- arms j for they who never had been at tournaments, had not such marks of distinction. They who insisted themselves in the Croisades, took up also several new figures hitherto unknown in armorial ensigns $ such as alerians, bezants, escalop-shells, martlets, &c. but more particularly crosses, of difl’erent colours for distinction’s sake. From this it may be concluded, that heraldry, like most human inventions, was insensibly introduced and established ; and that, after having been rude and unsettled for many ages, it was at last methodised, perfected, and fixed, by the Croisades and tourna¬ ments","Wil, Camden","DE,CH,US,FR",6,"Germany,Switzerland,United States,France","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"

"“ Lord Herbert (says Mr Granger), stands in the first rank of the public ministers, historians, and phi¬ losophers of his age. It is hard to say whether his per¬ son, his understanding, or his courage, was the most extraordinary ; as the fair, the learned, and the brave, held him in equal admiration. But the same man was wise and capricious ; redressed wrongs, and quarrelled for punctilios ; hated bigotry in religion, and was him¬ self a bigot to philosophy. He exposed himself to such dangers as other men of courage would have care¬ fully declined : and called in question the fundamen¬ tals of a religion which none had the hardiness to dis¬ pute besides himself.” Herbert, JFilham, earl of Pembroke, was born at Wilton in Wiltshire, 1580; and admitted to New- college in Oxford in 1592, where he continued about two years. In 1601 he succeeded to his father’s ho¬ nours and estate ; was made K. G. in 1604 ; and go¬ vernor of Portsmouth six years after. In 1626, he was elected chancellor of the university of Oxford; and about the same time made lord steward of the kino’s household. He died suddenly at his house called Bay- aard's castle, in London, April 10. 1630 ; according to the calculation of his nativity, says Wood, made several years before by Mr Thomas Allen of Gloucester- hall. Clarendon relates concerning this calculation that some considerable persons connected with Lord Pembroke being met at Maidenhead, one of them at supper drank a health to the lord steward; upon which another said, that he believed his lordship w-as at that time very merry ; for he had now outlived the day, which it had been prognosticated upon his nativity he would not outlive ; but he had outlived it now, for that was his birth day, which had completed his"" age to 50 years. The next morning, however, they re¬ ceived the news of his death. Whether the noble hi¬ storian really believed this and other accounts relating i® astrology, apparitions, providential interpositions, 4 &c. which he has inserted in his history, we do not Hcffc presume to say : he delivers them, however, as if he did H not actually disbelieve them.

"HER [ 429 ] HER cula. But little progress was made in tlie excavations till am. Charles infant of Spain ascended the Neapolitan throne j v—by whose unwearied efforts and liberality a very con¬ siderable part of Herculaneum has been explored, and such treasures of antiquity drawn out as form the most curious museum in the world. It being too arduous a task to attempt removing the covering, the king contented himself with cutting galleries to the princi¬ pal buildings, and causing the extent of one or two of them to be cleared. Of these the theatre is the most considerable. On a ballustrade which divided the or¬ chestra from the stage was found a row of statues ; and, on each side of the pulpitum, the equestrian figure of a person of the Nonia family. They are now placed under porticoes of the palace ; and from the great rarity of equestrian statues in marble would be very valuable objects, were their workmanship e.ven less ex¬ cellent than it is : one of them in particular is a very fine piece of sculpture. Since the king of Spain left Naples, the digging has been continued, but with less spirit and expenditure : indeed the collection of curio¬ sities brought out of Herculaneum and Pompeii is al¬ ready so considerable, that a relaxation of zeal and activity becomes excusable. They are now arranged in a wing of the palace ; and consist not only of statues, busts, altars, inscriptions, and other ornamental ap¬ pendages of opulence and luxury ; but also comprehend an entire assortment of the domestic, musical, and chi- rurgical instruments used by the ancients $ tripods of elegant form and exquisite execution, lamps in endless variety, vases and basons of noble dimensions, chande¬ liers of the most beautiful shapes, pateras and other appurtenances of sacrifice, looking-glasses of polish¬ ed metal, coloured glass, so hard, clear, and well stained, as to appear emeralds, sapphires, and other precious stones j a kitchen completely fitted up with copper-pans lined with silver, kettles, cisterns for heat¬ ing water, and every utensil necessary for culinary purposes $ specimens of various sorts of combustibles, retaining their form though burnt to a cinder j corn, bread, fish, oil, wine, and flour j a lady’s toilet, fully furnished with combs, thimbles, rings, paint, ear¬ rings, &c.

"“ The elegance of the attitudes, and the infinite va¬ riety of the subjects (Mr Swinburne observes), stamp them as performances worthy of the attention of artists and antiquarians ; but no pictures yet found are ma¬ sterly enough to prove that the Greeks carried the art of painting to as great a height of perfection as they did that of statuary. Yet can we suppose those au¬ thors incapable of appreciating the merits of an Apelles or a Zeuxis, who with so much critical discernment have pointed out the beauties of the works of a Phidias or a Praxiteles, beauties that we have still an oppor¬ tunity of contemplating ? would they have bestowed equal praises upon both kinds of performances if either Hercula- ot them had been much inferior to the other ? I think neunr, it is not probable ; and we must presume, that the Hercules, capital productions of the ancient painters, being of more perishable materials than busts and statues, have been destroyed in the fatal disasters that have so often afflicted both Greece and Italy. Herculaneum and Pompeii were but towns of the second order, and not likely to possess the masterpieces of the great artists, which were usually destined to adorn the more celebra¬ ted temples, or the palaces of kings and emperors.” A more valuable acquisition than bronzes and pictures was thought to be made, when a large parcel of manu¬ scripts was found among the ruins. Hopes were en¬ tertained that many, works of the classics, which time has deprived us of, were now going to be restored to light, and that a new mine of science was on the point of being opened. But the difficulty of unrolling the burnt parchment, of pasting the fragments on a flat surface, and of deciphering the obscure letters, have proved such obstacles, that very little progress has been made in the work. A priest invented the method of proceeding; but it was found not to answer. A great many other processes have since been tried, but none has been entirely successful. And the value of the writings which has been unrolled has by no means cor¬ responded to the public expectation.

"HERCULES, in fabulous history, a most renown¬ ed Grecian hero, who after death was ranked among the gods, and received divine honours. According to the ancients, there were many persons of the same name. Diodorus mentions three, Cicero six, and some authors extend the number to no less than forty-three",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"Of all these, one generally called the Theban Hercules, is the most celebrated ; and to him, as may easily be imagined, the actions of the others have been attribu¬ ted. He is reported to have been the son of Jupiter by Alcmena (wife to Amphitryon king of Argos), whom Jupiter enjoyed in the shape of her husband while he was absent; and in order to add the greater strength to the child, made that amorous night as long as three. Amphitryon having soon after accidentally killed his uncle and father-in-law Electryon, was oblig¬ ed to fly to Thebes, where Hercules was born. The jealousy of Juno, on account of her husband’s amour with Alcmena, prompted her to destroy the infant. For this purpose she sent two serpents to kill him in the cradle, but young Hercules strangled them both. He was early instructed in the liberal arts, and Castor the son of Tyndarus taught him how to fight, Eurytus how to shoot with a bow and arrows, Autolicus to drive a chariot, Linus to play on the lyre, and Eumolpus to sing. He, like the rest of his illustrious contemporaries, , soon after became the pupil of the centaur Chiron, and under him he perfected and rendered himself the most valiant and accomplished of the age. In the 18th year of his age he resolved to deliver the neighbourhood of Mount Cithreron from a huge lion which preyed on the flocks of Amphitryon his supposed father, and which laid waste the adjacent country. He went to the court of Thespius king of Thespis, who shared in the general calamity ; and he received here a tender treatment, and was entertained during 50 days. The 50 daughters of the king became mothers by Hercules during HER [ 430 ] , HER Hercules, during his stay at Thespis, and some say that it was et-  v—fected in one night. After he had destroyed the lion of Mount Cithoeron, he delivered his country from the annual tribute of 100 oxen which it paid to Erginus","Of, Jupiter, Jupiter, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules","US,TR",6,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"

"Euristheus, the son of Amphitryon, having succeeded his father, soon became jealous of Hercules ; and fear¬ ing lest he might by him be deprived of his crown, left no means untried to get rid of him. 01 this Her¬ cules was not insensible, because he was perpetually en¬ gaging him on some desperate expedition j and there¬ fore went to consult the oracle. But being answered that it was the pleasure of the gods that he should serve Euristheus 12 years, he fell into a deep melan¬ choly, which at last ended in a furious madness ; du¬ ring which, among other desperate actions, he put away his wife Megara, and murdered all the children he had by her. As an expiation of this crime, the king imposed upon him twelve labours surpassing the power of all other mortals to accomplish, which never¬ theless our hero performed with great ease. The fa¬ vours of the gods had indeed completely armed him when he undertook his labours. He had received a coat of armour and helmet from Minerva, a sword from Mercury, a horse from Neptune, a shield from Jupi¬ ter, a bow and arrows from Apollo, and from Vul¬ can a golden cuirass and brazen buskin, with a cele¬ brated club of brass according to the opinion of some writers",Hercules,US,6,United States,North America
"The first labour imposed upon him was the killing oi a lion in Nemea, a wood ofAchaia 5 whose hide was proof against any weapon, so that he was forced to seize him by the throat and strangle him. He carried the dead beast on his shoulders to Mycenae, and ever after clothed himself with the skin. Euristheus wTas so astonished at the sight of this beast, and at the cou¬ rage of Hercules, that he ordered him never to enter the gates of the city when he returned from his expe¬ ditions, but to wait for his orders without the walls",Hercules,US,6,United States,North America
"He even made himself a brazen vessel into which he retired whenever Hercules returned.—The second la¬ bour was to destroy the Lernaean hydra, which had seven beads according to Apollodorus, 50 according to Simonides, and 100 according to Diodorus. This celebrated monster he first attacked with his arrows j but soon after he came to a close engagement, and by means of his heavy club he destroyed the heads of his enemy. This, however, was productive of no advan¬ tage j for as soon as one head was beaten to pieces by the club, immediately two sprang up ; and the labour of Hercules would have remained unfinished, had not he commanded his friend Idas to burn with a hot iron the root of the head which he had crushed to pieces","Hercules, Hercules",US,6,United States,North America
"This succeeded j and Hercules became victorious, open¬ ed the belly of the monster, and dipped his arrows in the gall to render the wounds which he gave fatal and incurable.—He was ordered in his third labour to bring alive and unhurt into the presence of Euristheus a stag, famous for its incredible swiftness, its golden horns, and brazen feet. This celebrated animal fre¬ quented the neighbourhood of Oenoe 5 and Hercules 3 was employed for a whole year rn continually pursuing fjerci it: at last he caught it in a trap, or when tired, or, -y according to others, by slightly wounding it and lessen¬ ing its swiftness.—The fourth labour was to bring alive to Euristheus a wild boar which ravaged the neighbourhood of Erymanthus. In this expedition he destroyed the centaurs, and caught the boar by closely pursuing him through the deep snow. Euristheus was so frightened at the sight of the boar, that, according to Diodorus, be hid himself in bis brazen vessel for some days.—In his fifth labour Hercules was ordered to clean the stables of Augeas, where 3000 oxen had been confined for many years.—For his sixth labour he was ordered to kill the carnivorous birds which rava¬ ged the country near the lake Stymphalis in Arcadia","Hercules, Hercules, Hercules, Arcadia",US,6,United States,North America

This was in Iberia or Spain ; in the furthest parts of which he erected his two pillars, as the utmost limits of the then known world. These ten labours he achieved, as the fable says, in about eight years. In this last expedi¬ tion he is likewise affirmed to have killed Antaeus, a famous giant of a monstrous size, who, when weary with wrestling or labour, was immediately refreshed by touching the earth.

Here he cleared all the country from robbers; and Omphale, who was astonished at the greatness of his exploits, married him. Hercules had Agelaus and Lamon by Omphale, from whom Croesus king of Lydia was de¬ scended. He became also enamoured of one of Om- phale’s female servants, by whom he bad Alceus. Af¬ ter he had completed the years of his slavery, he re¬ turned to Peloponnesus, where he re-established on the throne of Sparta Tyndarus, who had been expelled by Hippocoon.

From Calydon he retired to the court of Ceyx king of Tracbinia. The king re¬ ceived him and his wife with great marks of friendship, and purified him of the murder which he had commit¬ ted at Calydon. Hercules rvas still mindful that he bad once been refused the hand of lole; he therefore made war against her father Eurytus, and killed him with three of his sons. Pole fell into the hands of her father’s murderer, and found that she was loved by Hercules as much as before. She accompanied him to Mount Oeta, where he was going to raise an altar and offer a solemn sacrifice to Jupiter. As he had not then the shirt and tunic in which he arrayed him¬ self to offer a sacrifice, he sent Lichas to Trachin to his wife Dejanira, in order to provide himself a proper dress, Dejanira had some time before been attempted by the Centaur Nessus, as he was ferrying her over the river Euenus *, and Hercules beholding it from the shore, had given him a mortal wound with an arrow","Hercules, Hercules, Jupiter, Hercules","US,PL",6,"United States,Poland","North America,Europe"

Others say that he lelt the charge of it to his son Philoctetes •, who having performed his father’s command, had his bow and ar¬ rows given him as a reward for his obedience. At the same time Jupiter, to he as good as his word, sent a flash ol lightning, which consumed both the pile and the hero j insomuch that loliius, coming to take up his bones, found nothing but ashes: from which they concluded, that he was passed from earth to heaven, and joined to the gods.

"It is observed, that there are none even of the twelve great gods of antiquity that have so many ancient mo¬ numents relating to them as Hercules. The famous statue of Hercules, in the Farnese palace at Rome, is well known to the connoisseurs : this represents him resting after the last of his twelve labours above recited, leaning on his club, and holding the apples of the Hesperides in his hand. In this statue, as in all the other figures of him, he is formed, by the breadth of his shoulders, the spaciousness of his chest, the large¬ ness of his size, and the firmness of his muscles, to express strength and a capacity of enduring great fa¬ tigue, which constituted the chief idea of virtue among the ancient heathens. His other attributes are his lion’s skin, his club, and his bow.—Hercules is re¬ presented by the ancients as an exemplar of virtue : however, the Hercules Bibux, or drunken Hercules, is no uncommon figure j and his amours are described both by the poets and artists. Thus, the Cupids are made to take away his club, and he is exhibited in the posture of bending under a little hoy j by which actions we perceive, that he who conquered all difficulties was a slave to love.

"1. The crown is in general hereditary, or descend¬ ible to the next heir, on the death or demise of the last proprietor. All regal governments must be either he¬ reditary or elective: and as there is no instance where¬ in the crown of England has ever been asserted to be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled trial of King Charles I.; it must of con¬ sequence be hereditary. Yet in thus asserting an he¬ reditary right, a jure divino title to the throne is by no means intended. Such a title may be allowed to have subsisted under the theocrative establishments of the children of Israel in Palestine ; but it never yet subsist¬ ed in any other country ; save only so far as kingdoms, like other human fabrics, are subject to the general and ordinary dispensations of Providence. Nor indeed have njure divino and an hereditary right any necessary connection with each other; as some have very weakly imagined. The titles of David and Jehu were equally jure divino as those of either Solomon or Ahab ; and yet David slew the sons of his predecessor, and Jelm his predecessor himself. And when our kings have the same warrant as they had, whether it be to sit upon the throne of their fathers, or to destroy the house of the preceding sovereign, they will then, and not before, possess the crown of England by a right like theirs, immediately derived from heaven. The hereditary right, which the laws of England acknowledge, owe# its origin to the founders of our constitution, and to them only. It has no relation to, nor depends upon, the civil laws of the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, or any other nation upon earth ; the municipal law# of one society having no connection with, or influence upon, the fundamental polity of another. The found¬ ers of our English monarchy might perhaps, if they had thought proper, have made it an elective mo¬ narchy ; but they rather chose, and upon good rea¬ son, to establish originally a succession by inheritance","Palestine, Providence, David, David","US,PA,IL,UK",6,"United States,Panama,Israel,N/A","North America,North America,Asia,N/A"
"It must be owned, an elective monarchy seems to be the most obvious, and best suited of any to the rational principles of government, and the freedom of human nature ; and accordingly we find from history, that, in the infancy and first rudiments of almost every state, the leader, chief magistrate, or prince, hath usually been elective. And, if the individuals who compose that state could always continue true to first principles, uninfluenced by passion or prejudice, unassailed by cor¬ ruption, and unawed by violence, elective succession were as much to be desired in a kingdom as in other inferior communities. The best, the wisest, and the bravest man, would then be sure of receiving that crown which his endowments have merited ; and the sense of an unbiassed majority would be dutifully acquiesced in by the few who were of different opinions. But history and observation will inform us, that elections of every kind H E H 1 oditary kind (in the present state of human nature) are too fre- ght. quently brought about by influence, partiality, and ar- ^ ~v"" tifice 5 and, even Where the ease is otherwise, these practices will be often suspected, and as constantly charged upon the successful, by a splenetic disappointed minority. I his is an evil to which all societies are liable ; as well as those of a private and domestic kind, as the great community of the public, which regulates and includes the rest. But in the former there is this advantage, I hat such suspicions, if false, proceed no farther than jealousies and murmurs, which time will effectually suppress ; and, if true, the injustice may be remedied by legal means, by an appeal to those tribu¬ nals to which every member of society has (by beco¬ ming such) virtually engaged to submit. Whereas, in the great and independent society which every nation composes, there is no superior to resort to but the law ef nature; no method to redress the infringements of that law, but the actual exertion of private force. As therefore between two nations, complaining of mutual injuries, the quarrel can only be decided by the law of arms; so in one and the same nation, when the funda¬ mental principles of their common union are supposed to be invaded, and more especially when the appoint¬ ment of their chief magistrate is alleged to be unduly made, the only tribunal to which the complainants can appeal is that of the God of battles, the only process by which the appeal can be carried on is that of a ci¬ vil and intestine war. An hereditary succession to the crown is therefore now established, in this and most other countries, in order to prevent that periodical bloodshed and misery, which the history of ancient imperial Rome, and the later experience of modern times, has shown to be the consequences of elective kingdoms",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"^ 2. But, secondly, as to the particular mode of inhe¬ ritance. It in general corresponds with the feodal path of descents, chalked out by the common law in the suc¬ cession to landed estates ; yet with one or two material exceptions. Like them the crown will descend line- ally to the issue of the reigning monarch ; as it did from Ring John to Richard II. through a regular pe¬ digree of six lineal generations : As in them the pre¬ ference of males to females, and the right of primoge¬ niture among the males, are strictly adhered to. Thus Edward V. succeeded to the crown, in preference to Richard his younger brother, and Elizabeth his eldest sister. Like them, on failure of the male line it de¬ scends to the issue female ; according to the ancient British custom remarked by Tacitus, Solent fcemina- rum ductu bellare, et sexum in imperils non discerncre, Jhus Mary I. succeeded to Edward VI.; and the line of Margaret queen of Scots, the daughter of Henry VII",Elizabeth,"US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"succeeded, on failure of the line of Henry VIII. his son. Rut among the females, the crown descends by Tight of primogeniture to the eldest daughter only and her issue ; and not, as in common inheritance, to all the daughters at once ; the evident necessity of a sole succession to the throne having occasioned the royal law of descents to depart from the common law in this respect: and therefore Queen Mary, on the death of |ier brother, succeeded to the crown alone, and not in partnership with her sister Elizabeth. Again, the doctrine of representation prevails in the descent of the crown, as it Joes in other inheritances : whereby Vol. X.

But herein there is no objection (as in the case of common de¬ scents) to the succession of a brother, an uncle, or other collateral relation, of the half-blood; that is, where the relationship proceeds not from the same couple of ancestors (which constitutes a kinsman of the whole blood), hut from a single ancestor only ; as when two persons are derived from the same father, and not from the same mother, or vice versa: provided only, that the one ancestor, from whom both are descended, be that from whose veins the blood-royal is communi¬ cated to each.

"When about 25 years of age, his father Antipater made him governor of Galilee, where he distinguished him- se If by suppressing a band of robbers, and executing their ringleader. For this action, as it was performed by his own authority, and without trial of the crimi¬ nals, he was ordered to appear before the sanhedrim ; but by the influence of his party and the favour of the high priest, he escaped judgment.

In filling his empty coffers he was guilty of many cruel extortions, and it is but justice to add, that he performed many acts of clemency.

"Archidamus, king of Euboea, had instituted funeral games in honour of his own memory, which his sons afterwards took care to have performed. Here He¬ siod was a competitor for the prize in poetry; and won 5 a tripod, which he consecrated to the muses.

When he was grown old, for it is ^ agreed by all that he lived to a very great age, he re¬ moved to Locris, a town about the same distance from Mount Parnassus as Ascra was from Helicon. His death was tragical. The man with whom he lived at Locris, a Milesian born, ravished a maid in the same house ; and though Hesiod was entirely ignorant of the fact, yet being maliciously accused by her brothers as an accomplice, he was injuriously slain with the ravish- er, and thrown into the sea. The Theogomj, and Works and Days, are the only undoubted pieces of this poet now extant : though it is supposed that these poems have not descended perfect and finished to the present time.

"HESPERIDES, in the ancient mythology, were the daughters of Hesper or Hesperus, the brother of Atlas. According to Diodorus, Hesperus and Atlas were two brothers who possessed great riches in the western parts of Africa. Hesperus had a daughter called Hes¬ peria, who married her uncle Atlas, and Irom this mar¬ riage proceeded seven daughters, called Hesperides from the name of their mother, and Atlantides from that ot their father. According to the poets, the Hesperides were three in number, .ZEgle, Arethusa, and Hesper- thusa. Hesiod, in his Theogony, makes them the daughters of Nox, Night, and sets them in the same place with the Gorgons ; viz. at the extremities of the west, near Mount Atlas: it is on that account he makes them the daughters of Night, because the sun sets there. The Hesperides are represented by the an¬ cients as having the keeping of certain golden apples, on the other side the ocean.

"HESSE, a country of Germany, iu the circle of the Upper Rhine ; bounded on the south by Baden and Ba¬ varia ; on the east by the principalities of Saxe Mein- ingen, Saxe Weimar, and the Prussian states; on the north by Brunswick and the Prussian states; and on the west by the same states and Nassau. In the above limits, the county of Katzenellnbogen and some other territories are not included. The whole coun¬ try, in its utmost length, is near 100 miles, and in some places about 60 in breadth. The air is cold, but wholesome ; and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture. The country abounds also in cat¬ tle, fish, and game ; salt springs, baths, and mineral waters. The hills, which are many, yield silver, cop¬ per, lead, iron, alum, vitriol, pit-coal, sulphur, boles, a porcelain earth, marble, and alabaster. In the Eder, gold is sometimes found; and at Frankenberg a gold mine was formerly wrought. Besides many lesser streams, Hesse is watered by the following rivers, viz. the Lhan, the Fulda, the Eder or Schwalm, the Werra or Weser, and Diemel. The Mayne passes through the county of Katzenellnbogen. This coun¬ try, like most others in Germany, has its states, consist¬ ing of the prelates, as they are called, the nobility, and the towns. The diets are divided into general and particular, and the latter into the greater and smaller committees. The house of Hesse is divided into two principal branches, viz. Cassel and Darmstadt, of which Philipsdale, Rhinfeldts, and Homburg, are collateral branches ; the two first of Hesse-Cassei, and the last of Hesse-Darmstadt. Their rights and privileges are very considerable. In particular, they have votes at the diet of Frankfort. The princes of Hesse-Cassel are not of age till they are 25, but those of Hesse- Darmstadt are so at 18. The right of primogeniture hath been established in both houses.

"Fly. The destruction occasioned by them is described in the “-■~v  American Museum (a magazine published at Phila¬ delphia) for February 1787, in the following words: “ It is well known that all the crops of wheat in all the land over which it has extended, have fallen before it, and that the farmers beyond it dread its approach ; the prospect is, that unless means are discovered to prevent its progress, the whole continent will be overrun •,—a calamity more to be dreaded than the ravages of war.” This terrible insect appeared first in Long Island during the American war, and was supposed to have been brought from Germany by the Hessians ; whence it had the name of the Hessian fly. From thence it has proceeded inland at the rate of about 15 or 20 miles annually; and by the year 1789 had reached 200 miles from the place where it was first observed. At that time it continued to proceed with unabating in¬ crease ; being apparently stopped neither by rivers nor mountains. In the fly state it is likewise exceedingly troublesome ; by getting into houses in swarms, falling into victuals and drink ; filling the windows, and flying perpetually into the candles. It still continued to infest Long Island as much as ever; and in many places the culture of wheat was entirely abandoned","Long Island, Long Island","US,DE",6,"United States,Germany","North America,Europe"
"This, however, has not yet passed the river Delaware ; though there is danger of its being gradually inured to colder climates so as to extend its depredations to the northern colonies also. Put it is by no means the same with the Hessian fly. The wheat fly is the same with that whose ravages in the Angumois in France are recorded by M. Du Hamel ; it eats the grain, and is a moth in its perfect state. On the other hand, the Hessian fly has hitherto been unknown to naturalists ; it eats only the leaf and stalk ; and, in its perfect state, is probably a tenthredo, like the black negro-fly of the turnip",Delaware,"FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"As of late years great quantities of wheat were im¬ ported from America into Britain, it became an object xvorthy of the attention of government to consider how far it was proper to allow of such importation, lest this destructive insect might be brought along with the grain. The matter, therefore, was fully canvassed be¬ fore the privy council; and the following is the sub¬ stance of the information relative to it ; and in conse¬ quence of this, the importation of American wheat was forbid by proclamation",,US,6,United States,North America
"1. By a letter, dated 22d April 1788, Mr Bond, consul at Philadelphia, informed the marquis of Caer- marthen, that there was a design to export wheat from thence to England; that the fly had made great depre¬ dations ; and that there might be danger of its thus be¬ ing conveyed across the Atlantic. He added, that it was not known where the eggs of the insect were depo¬ sited, though it was supposed to be in the grain. Steep¬ ing the seed in elder juice he recommended as an effec¬ tual remedy and preservative of the crop",Philadelphia,US,6,United States,North America
"3. A farther account of the insect was given by Dr Mitchel, in consequence of the above-mentioned letter from the marquis of Caermarthen. According to him it was first discovered in the year 1776, on Staten Island, and the west end of Long Island ; since that time it proceeded regularly through the southern dis¬ trict of the state of New York, part of Connecticut; and at the time of giving the account, July 1788, had got into New Jersey. As it appeared about the time that the Hes-ian troops arrived, an opinion had gone abroad that they brought it along with them ; but the Doctor was of opinion that it is a native animal, nou¬ rished by some indigenous plant, but which then, for the first time, came among the wheat, and found it proper food. He had seen the caterpillar, chrysalis, and fly, but never could find the egg, or discover where it is deposited. The caterpillar appears, as has already been said, in autumn, and, after having devoured the tender stalk, soon becomes a chrysalis, coloured like a flax-seed ; which, being fixed between the leaf and the stalk, injures the plant by its mechanical pressure; from this proceeds the fly, which is either able of itself to sustain the intense winter frosts, or lays eggs capa¬ ble of doing it. Early in the spring the caterpillar appears again, even when the heat is scarce sufficient to make the wheat grow ; its ravages, therefore, are at this period particularly destructive ; and it passes through its metamorphoses with such speed, as to pro¬ duce a third generation while the wheat is yet tender and juicy ; however, as the corn has by this time grown considerably, the third generation is not so destructive as the second. It hurts chiefly by rendering the straw weak, and liable to break down when loaded after¬ wards by the weight of a full ear ; “ and sometimes (says the Doctor) it will be infested by the fourth* swarm before harvest.” 4. In another communication of Sir Joseph Banks, dated July 24. 1788, he makes some general observa¬ tions on the nature of those caterpillars from which flying insects proceed ; and to which class both th» flying weevil and Hessian fly belong. Nature, he ob¬ serves, has provided against the kinds of danger these tender insects are most likely ta meet with. Thus, in climates where the winters are severe, the eggs of the most tender insects resist the force of the usual frost ^ in seasons of remarkable severity, indeed, some are de¬ stroyed ; 5 H E S [ 45i ] H E S isiaa stroyed ; but a sufficient number always escape for pro- ('Ijr pagating the species. The young caterpillar, if haidi- * ""v  ' ed before its proper food be ready, will survive even weeks before it perishes for want of nourishment j and in some few instances where it is hatched in the au¬ tumn, it is directed by instinct to spin a web, in which it remains torpid and without food during the whole winter. The chrysalis, though deprived of loco-mo¬ tion, is capable of resisting various dangers, arising from cold, heat, wet, &c. •, and the length of time which the animal remains in that state is capable of very consider¬ able extension. The complete animal, tender as it ap¬ pears, and intended to exist no longer than is neces¬ sary to fulfil the business of propagation, which, in some species, is gone through in a few days, neverthe¬ less is capable, in some instances, of enduring the utmost variation of climate ; and if by accidental circum¬ stances, the sexes are prevented from meeting, its short life is extended to many times the amount of its usual duration","Long Island, New York",US,6,United States,North America
"6. Further recourse was now had to America for information. The marquis of Caermarthen wrote to Sir John Temple at New York, the British consul ge¬ neral $ and this gentleman applied to Colonel Morgan, who had been more curious with respect to this insect than any other person with whom he was acquainted","Temple, New York","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"His account was, that the Hessian fly was first intro¬ duced into America hy means of some straw made use of in package, or otherwise landed on Long Island at an early period of the late war *, and its first appear¬ ance was in the neighbourhood of Sir William How'e’s debarkation, and at Flat Bush. From thence it spread in every direction, but at first very slowly j and it was not till the year 1786 that they reached Mr Morgan’s farm, situated not quite 50 miles from New York. No damage was done the first season, and very little the second j but in 1788 they were materially damaged, and in some places totally destroy¬ ed all round. “ The name of Hessian fly (says Air Alorgan) was given to this insect by myself and a friend early after its appearance on Long Island.” In a letter to Genera! Washington, dated July 31st 1788, Mr Morgan treats particularly of the insect it¬ self, and mentions several experiments made by himself to oppose its depredations. The result of these was, that good culture of strong soil, or well manured lands, may sometimes produce a crop of wheat or barley, when that sowed on poor or middling soil, without the other advantages, will be totally destroyed. “ But (says lie) as the insect lives in its aurelia state in straw and litter through the winter, I find that unmixed barn¬ yard manure spread on the land in the spring multi¬ plies the fly to an astonishing degree : hence the farmer will see the necessity of mixing his yard with earth and marl in heaps ; adding, where he can do it, a quan¬ tity of lime, and changing the heaps, after they have undergone the necessary fermentation, that their parts may be well incorporated, and a new digestion brought on, which will effectually destroy the insects. Rolling of wheat just before the first frosts in autumn, and sooa after the last in spring, or before the wheat begins to pipe or spindle, has also a good effect. In the first place, it is a part of good culture; and, secondly, the roller crushes and destroys a great proportion of the insects. Top-dressings of lime, or of live ashes, are useful as manures, and may (when applied about the times I have mentioned as proper for rolling) be of¬ fensive to the insect; but if used in sufficient quantity to destroy them, would, I believe, destroy the wheat also","Long Island, New York, Long Island, Washington",US,6,United States,North America
"In the year 1782, a particular species of wheat wTas In¬ troduced on Long Island, which is found to resist the fly, and to yield a crop when all other wheats in the same neighbourhood are destroyed by it. But as this wheat has been incautiously sowed in field with other kinds, it has generally become so mixed by the far¬ mers, as to suffer in its character in proportion to this mixture; insomuch, that some farmers, from inatten¬ tion to this circumstance, have condemned it altogether",Long Island,US,6,United States,North America
"H E S [ 452 J H E S Hessian tlie consequence of which has been a good crop, whilst Fly. my neighbours Helds, sowed with other kinds of wheat, have been either totally destroyed or materially injur¬ ed. I have satisfied myself that this species of wheat was brought to New York in 1782 j that a cargo of it was then sent to Messrs Underhill’s mill to be ma¬ nufactured into flour ; and that from seed saved out of this parcel, the yellow-bearded wheat was propaga¬ ted. It is a generally received opinion, that the capa¬ city of the yellow-bearded wheat to resist the attacks of the fly is owing to the hardness or solidity of the straw ; but when we reflect that other wheats are some¬ times wholly cut oft’in the fall of the year, and some¬ times early in the spring, before the season of its run¬ ning to straw, we shall be induced to assign some other cause. I cannot point out more than two distinctions of this from other wheats. The first is in the ear, at or after harvest. The obvious difference, then, is in the colour of the chaff. The second can only be ob¬ served by the miller, who says, “ this grain requires to be more aired and dried than any other wheat before grinding, or it will not yield its flour so kindly, as it is of a more oily nature ; but when thus aired and dried, the quality and quantity of its flour are equal to that of the best white wheat.” 7. In a letter to Mr Wadsworth, dated 22d Au¬ gust 1788, we are informed that the experiments made with elder juice, recommended as a preventive of this evil by Mr Bond, were fallacious, and had fail¬ ed in every instance in 1785; but the efficacy of the yellow-bearded wheat in resisting the attacks of the fly is confirmed. The progress of the fly northward is likewise confirmed 5 but we are told that it has disap¬ peared in many places near New York, where it form¬ erly abounded","New York, New York",US,6,United States,North America
"8. In consequence of the correspondence between the marquis of Caermarthen and Mr Bond, the latter made very particular inquiry concerning this mischie¬ vous insect, and has given a better account of it than any of the above. “ The Hessian fly (says he) is a small dark fly, with thin, long, black legs 5 clear trans¬ parent wings, extending far beyond the body of the trunk ; with small, though perceptible, horns or feelers projecting from the sneut. These I have seen appear in size and shape like a little fly which attacks cheese in this country, and which is very closely watched bv the keepers 01 dairies here, as productive of the worm or skippers which destroy cheese ; and it is remark¬ able, that the worm produced from the egg of the Hessian fly, though rather thinner and longer, bears a strong resemblance to the worm in cheese. The horns which evidently appear on the Hessian fly may be provided by nature as feelers to enable them to perfo¬ rate hard grain, as well as grain in a softer state j though I have not vet seen any person who has perceived the egg, worm, or fly, in the grain of the wheat, or who has found any nit, mucus, or even dust, in the drv straw in ricks or barns, to induce a belief that the* egg is there deposited after the harvest. One publication signed a Landholder, goes so far as to favour the idea that the fly even perforates the seed, and deposits its eggs therein. His ideas have been condemned, as tending to mislead others j hut by no means confuted either by reason or experiment. An observation I made myself, gave me some cause to apprehend that the idea mentioned in the paper signed a Landholder was founded in fact: Upon examining a barn, in a country wherein the fly had not been known to injure the har¬ vest (though it has now certainly made its appearance there within a few weeks), I observed in the flaws and apertures where the wood was decayed, over which cobwebs were woven, several of these files entangled in the webs, many of them dead, but some alive, and struggling to disengage themselves ; from hence I con¬ cluded that there was a propensity in the fly to get in¬ to the mow 5 but whether with a purpose of mere shel¬ ter and nurture, or with a view to deposit its eggs, I am at a loss to decide.” 9. Mr Bond then refers to some observations by a Mr Potts and Mr Cleavei*, which, with several other papers on the subject, he had inclosed in his letter to the marquis. The former was a farmer in the county of Chester, who stacked his wheat in autumn 1788, at a time when the fly had not been seen in or near that county. About six or seven weeks after the harvest he had occasion to thresh some of his wheat j and with a view to prevent its scattering and wasting, he threw the sheaves from the rick upon a large sheet. On ta¬ king up the sheaves to carry them to the threshing- floor, he perceived a great number of flies, answering precisely the description of the Hessian fly, lying upon the sheet, some dead, and others in a torpid state j from whence he concluded that the fly had got a footing in his rick $ but from any examination either of the straw or grain, no trace of the eggs being de¬ posited was discovered. Mr Cleaver, a farmer in the same county, apprehending that the fly might ap¬ proach his neighbourhood, sowed some wheat in his garden, which grew so as to appear above ground in less than a fortnight, when a violent north-east wind came on ; and immediately after he perceived small clouds of flies over and about the wheat he had sown",Chester,US,6,United States,North America
"— 10. A similar account of the Hessian fly is given by Mr Jacobs, an experienced farmer in the county of Montgomery. From his observations the egg is usual¬ ly deposited in the funnel or sheath, a little above the first joint. When the eggs are laid in the autumn or spring, they are utterly destructive of the growth of the wheat ; but when they are deposited shortly be¬ fore the harvest, the grain or even the stalk is scarcely affected, especially in rich ground. The egg, he says, is at first very minute ; it grows rapidly, becomes full and large, and turns to a brown hue, in size and co¬ lour very like a flax seed. A material difference was , also perceived between rich and poor ground with re¬ spect to the ravages of the fly ; but none between moist and dry soils. He is also of opinion that the yellow- bearded wheat will resist the attacks of the fly; and that rolling and feeding the wheat will be of great ser¬ vice",Montgomery,US,6,United States,North America
"14. From the whole correspondence on this subject, which from the abridgement just now given ot it is evidently somewhat discordant, Sir Joseph Banks drew up a report for the privy council, dated March 2.1789* in which he states the following particulars: 1. The appearance of the fly in Long Island was first obser¬ ved in 1770. We must suppose this to be meant H E S [ 454 1 H E S Hessian that its destructive effects became then first percep- Fly. tiblej for it seems undoubtedly to have been known   ' in the year 1776. 2. The opinion of Colonel Mor¬ gan, that it was imported by the Hessians, seems to be -erroneous, as no such insect can be found to exist in Germany or any other part of Kurope. 3. Since its first appearance in Long Island it has advanced at the rate of 15 or 20 miles a year, and neither waters nor mountains have impeded its progress. It was seen crossing the Delaware like a cloud, from the Fall’s Township to Makefield $ had reached Saratoga 200 miles from its first appearance, infesting the counties of Middlesex, Somerset, Huntington, Morris, Sussex, the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, all the wheat coun¬ ties of Connecticut, &c. committing the most dreadful ravages •, attacking wheat, rye, barley, and timothy- grass. 4. The Americans who have suffered by this insect, speak of it in terms of the greatest horror. In Colonel Morgan’s letter to Sir John Temple, he uses the following expressions. “ Were it to reach Great Britain, it would be the greatest scourge that island ever experienced ; as it multiplies from heat and moi¬ sture, and the most intense frosts have no effect on the egg or aurelia. Were a single straw, containing the insect, egg, or aurelia, to be carried and safely depo¬ sited in the centre of Norfolk in England, it would multiply in a few years, so as to destroy all the wheat and bailey crops of the whole kingdom. There can¬ not exist such an atrocious villain as to commit such an act intentionally. 5. No satisfactory account of the mode in which this insect is propagated has hither¬ to been obtained. Those which say that the eggs are deposited on the stalk from six or eight to 50, and by their growth compress and hinder the stalk from grow¬ ing, are evidently erroneous, and the authors of them have plainly mistaken the animal itself for its eggs","March, Long Island, Long Island, Delaware, Saratoga, Somerset, Huntington, Philadelphia, Temple, Norfolk","US,DE,GB",6,"United States,Germany,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"
"It is sufficient to remember, that eggs do not grow or increase in hulk, to prove that what they observed was not eggs. 6. The landholder’s opinion, that the eggs are deposited on the ripe grains of wheat, though contradicted by Colonel Morgan, is not disproved, as the colonel advances no argument against it. 7. A letter dated New York, September I. 1786, says, that the eggs are deposited on the young blade, resembling -what we call a fly-blow in meat ; very small, and but wre in a place : but this, though the only natural mode of accounting for the appearance of the insect, had it been true, must undoubtedly have been confirmed by numbers of observations. 8. Even though this should be found hereafter to be the case, there will still re¬ main a danger of the aurelias being beaten off by the flail from the straw in threshing the wheat, and im¬ ported into Britain along with it ; the presence of these flies in barns having been fully proved by the observa¬ tions of Messrs Potts and Bond. 9. None of the re¬ medies proposed against this destructive insect have been in any degree effectual, excepting that of sowing the yellow-bearded wheat •, the straw of which is suf¬ ficiently strong to resist the impression of the insect, and even if its eggs are deposited upon it, receives lit¬ tle injury in point of produce in grain : this provides, however, no remedy for the loss of the barley crop, nor for that which must be incurred by sowing the yellow-bearded wheat on lands better suited by nature for the produce of other kinds : it appears also that this very kind is liable to degenerate, and probably Hes$i« from a different cause than that proposed by Colonel Fly",New York,US,6,United States,North America
"Morgan, viz. the mixture with common wheat. 9.'t* Though the Agricultural Society at Philadelphia, as well as Colouel Morgan, have declared their opinions decisively, that no danger can arise from wheat import¬ ed into Britain, as the insect has no immediate con¬ nection w'ith the grain *, yet with nearly, if not exactly the same materials before him which these gentlemen were furnished with, Sir Joseph Banks could not avoid drawing a conclusion directly contrary ; and he con¬ cludes his report with the words of Mr Bond in a let¬ ter to the marquis of Caermarthen. “ Satisfactory as it would be to my feelings to be able to say with pre¬ cision, that I apprehend no danger of extending the mischief by seed, my duty urges me to declare, that I have not heard nor seen any conclusive fact by which I could decide on a matter of such importance j and till that test occurs, the wisdom of guarding against so grievous a calamity is obvious.” On the 27th of April the same year, another pa¬ per, by way of appendix to the foregoing, was given in by Sir Joseph Banks. In this he again observes, that none of the descriptions of any European insect hitherto published answer exactly to the Hessian fly",Philadelphia,US,6,United States,North America
"In a letter from Mr Bond to the marquis of Caermar- therr, be mentions another kind of insect in the state of Maryland, called by way of eminence t/ie fly; and •which in some things resembles the Hessian fly, though it cannot be accounted the same. It makes its way in- >to the mow, and bites the end of the grain percepti¬ bly, and no doubt deposits its eggs in the grain itself} since it has been observed, that wheat recently thresh¬ ed, and laid in a warm dry place, will soon be covered with an extreme clammy crust, which binds the wheat on the surface together in such a way as to ad¬ mit its being lifted in lumps } but the wheat beneath will not he hurt to any considerable depth. Such is the quality of this fly, that if the hand be inserted into the heap affected by it, watery blisters are immedi¬ ately raised } and the farmers and slaves, riding upon bags of this infected wheat, never fail to be severely blistered thereby. “ This insect (says he) is called in Maryland the Revolution fly, by the friends of the British government } but from all I can learn it is not the same insect which originated on Long Island, and is called the Hessian fly (by way of opprobrium) by those who favoured the revolution. All the papers I have read on the Hessian fly are very inaccurate, not to say contradictory } and I am convinced it is by no means a settled point at this moment, in what manner and place the eggs of these insects are deposited. The policy which induced government to open the ports being founded on an appearance of a scarcity of corn, that evil may be remedied by the admission of flour instead of grain } and though the countries from whence the flour is carried will have the advantage of the manufacture, still that cannot be reckoned as an ob¬ ject, when opposed in the scale to an evil of such im¬ mense magnitude as the introduction of so destructive an insect may occasion. The ravages here are beyond conception ruinous. Many farmers have bad their crops so completely cut off as to be left without bread- corn or even seed-corn.

"The Hidalgos claim a descent from those valiant sol¬ diers who retired into Castile, and the mountains of Asturias, and other remote parts of Spain, on the in¬ vasion of the Moors, where having fortified themselves, they successively descended into the plains, in propor¬ tion to the success of their arms $ from the notoriety of their persons, or the lands they became possessed of, they acquired the appellation of Hidalgos notorios, Hi¬ dalgos de solar conocido, or de casa solariega. Of these, according to Hernando Mexia, there are three sorts ; the first being lords of places, villages, towns, or castles, from whence they took their surnames, as the Guzmans, Mendozas, Laras, Guivras, and others ; the second, who recovered any fortress from the Moors, as the Ponces ol Leon, and others; and the third sort from the places where they resided, or held jurisdiction, as Rodrigo de Navarez was called of Antequara, from being alcayde there. But this definition is not considered as exact or conclusive by Otalora, another civilian, who says that the true meaning of Hidalgos de solar conocido is explained by the laws of Castile to be a well known mansion or possession, the nature of which is particularly explained in the laws oi Parditas, lib. v. tit. 35. which describe three sorts of tenures, called Devisa, Solariega, and Behetria. By the first, lands are devised by the ancestor ; solar is a tenure upon another person’s manor, and obliges the owner to receive the lord of the fee when necessity obliges him to travel ; and Behetria is in the nature of an allo¬ dium. In proportion as these Aborigines gained ground on the Moors, and increased in their numbers, many private persons distinguished themselves by their valour, and obtained testimonies of their services called cartas de mcrced, which served them as a foundation of their birth and good descent, without which documents their posterity could not make it appear; and if from a lapse of time, or other unavoidable accidents, such proof should happen to be lost or destroyed, the law affords them a remedy under these circumstances, by a declaration importing, that such persons as are sup¬ posed to have had such certificates, may be relieved by making it appear that their ancestors, time imme- H I D morial, have always been held and reputed as Hidal- Hidalgo, gos, and enjoyed the privileges of such, form a strong —y— presumption in their favour; the possession of land having equal force to any other document; which is fully set forth in the Pragmatica of Cordova. To these executory letters are granted, cartas executorias, ex¬ pressive of their privileges; and for the better regu¬ lation of these matters, proper officers are appointed in the chancery courts, called alcaldes de lor hidalgos, who ought to be hidalgos themselves, and hold juris¬ diction in these cases, and no others ; but even here innovations have taken place ; for as these grants flow irom the sovereign, who is the fountain of honour, some are declared Hidalgos de sangre, by right of descent, and others de privilegio, or by office, in which the will of the sovereigns has made amends for any deficiency of blood","Of, Hidalgo, Cordova","ES,TR,MX,PH",6,"Spain,Turkey,Mexico,Philippines","Europe,Asia,North America,Asia"

"' “ The shepherd-poet of Smyrna, after mentioning a cave in Phrygia sacred to the Nymphs, relates, that there Luna had once descended from the sky to En- dymion, while he was sleeping by his herds ; that marks of their bed were then extant under the oaks ; and that in the thickets around it the milk of cows had been spilt, which men still beheld with admiration (for such was the appearance if you saw it very far off) ; but that from thence flowed clear or warm water, which in a little while concreted round about the channels, and formed a stone pavement.

"In the same year Dr Brook Taylor published his “ li¬ near Perspective: or, a new method of representing justly all manner of objects as they appear to the eye in all situations.” On this complete and universal theory our artist grounded his subsequent practice ; and it has been generally allowed, that few, if any, of the profes¬ sion at that time were so thorough masters of that ex¬ cellent but intricate system. In 1716, he married Miss Susanna Hiller, daughter and heiress of Mr An¬ thony Hiller of Effingham in Surrey ; a young lady in every respect worthy of his choice. For Mr Chesel- den’s “ Anatomy of the Human Body,” published in 1722, he made drawings from the real subjects at the time of dissection, two of which were engraved for that work, and appear, but without his name, in tables xii. and xiii. In the same year, on the exhibition of “ The Conscious .Lovers,” written by Sir Richard Steele, Mr Highmore addressed a. letter to the author on the limits of filial obedience, pointing out a mate¬ rial defect in the character of Bevil, with that clear¬ ness and precision for which, in conversation and wri¬ ting, he was always remarkable, as the pencil by no mean9 H I G [ 467 ] H I G e> means engrossed his whole attention. His reputation and business increasing, he took a more conspicuous station, by removing to a house in Lincoln’s-Inn- Fields, in March 1723-4 •, and an opportunity soon of¬ fered of introducing him advantageously to the nobi¬ lity, &c. by his being desired, by Mr Pine the en¬ graver, to make the drawings for his prints of the knights of the Bath, on the revival of that order in 1725.

In the sum¬ mer of 1732, Mr Highmore visited the continent, in company with Dr Pemberton, Mr Benjamin Robins, and two other friends, chiefly with a view of seeing the gallery of pictures belonging to the elector Palatine at Dusseldorp, collected by Rubens, and supposed the best in Europe. At Antwerp also he had peculiar pleasure in contemplating the works of his favourite master. In their return they visited the principal towns in Holland. In 1734, he made a like excursion, but alone, to Paris, where he received great civilities from his countrymen then there, particularly the duke of Kingston, Dr Hickman (his tutor), Robert Knight, Esq. (the late cashier), &c. Here he had the satis¬ faction of being shown, by Cardinal de Polignac, his famous group of antique statues, the court of Lyco- medes, then just brought from Rome, and since pur¬ chased by the king of Prussia, and destroyed at Char- lottenbourg in 1760 by the Russians.

"The publication of “ Pamela;” in 1744, gave rise to a set of paintings by Mr Highmore, which were en¬ graved by two French engravers, and published by subscription in 1745. In the same year he painted the only original of the late General Wolfe, then about 18. His Pamela introduced him to the acquaintance and friendship of the excellent author whose picture he drew, and for whom he painted the only original of Dr Young. In 1750 he had the misfortune to lose his wife. On the first institution of the academy of painting, sculpture, &c. in 1753, he was elected one of the professors; an honour which, on account of his many avocations, he desired to decline. In 1754 he published “ A critical examination of those two Paintings (by Rubens) on the Ceiling of the Ban- queting-house at Whitehall, in which Architecture is introduced, so far as relates to Perspective; to¬ gether with the Discussion of a Question which has been the Subject of Debate among Painters:” print¬ ed in 410. In the solution of this question, he pro¬ ved that Rubens and several other great painters were mistaken in the practice, and Mr Kirby and se- H veral other authors in the theory. And in the 17th volume oi the “ Monthly Review,” he animadverted (anonymously) on Mr Kirby’s unwarrantable treat¬ ment of Mr Ware, and detected and exposed his er¬ rors, even when he exults in his own superior science",Whitehall,"US,FR",6,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

"In 1761, on the marriage of his daughter to the reverend Mr Duncombe, son to one of his oldest friends, he took a resolution of retiring from business, and disposing of his collection of pictures, which he did hy auction, in March 1762, and soon after removed to his son-in-law’s at Canterbury, where he passed the re¬ mainder of his life without ever revisiting the metro¬ polis. But though he had laid down the pencil, he never wanted employment: so active and vigorous was his mind, that, with a constitutional flow of spirits, and a relish for instructive society, he was never less “ alone than when alone ;” and besides, his profession¬ al pursuits above mentioned, to philosophy, both na¬ tural and moral, and also to divinity, he laudably dedica¬ ted his time and attention. No man had more clear¬ ness and precision of ideas, or a more ardent desire to know the truth ; and, when known, conscientiously to pursue it. With strong passions, ever guided by the strictest virtue, he had a tender, susceptible heart, always open to the distress of his fellow-creatures, and always ready to relieve them. His capital work of the literary kind was his “ Practice of Perspective, on the principles of Dr Brook Taylor,” &c. written many years before, but not published till 1763, when it was printed for Nonrse, in one vol. 4to. This not only evinced his scientific knowledge of the subject, but removed, by its perspicuity, the only objection, that can be made to the system of Dr Taylor. It ac¬ cordingly received, from his friends and the intelligent public, the applauses it deserved. In 1765 he pub¬ lished (without his name) Observations on a Pamph¬ let entitled, “ Christianity not founded on Argument;” in which, after showing that it is a continued irony, and lamenting that so ample a fitdd should be offered the author of it for the display of his sophistry; he gives up creeds, articles, and catechisms, as out-works raised by fallible men, and, confining himself to the de¬ fence of the gospel, or citadel, shows, that pure primi¬ tive Christianity, though assaulted by infidels, will ever remain impregnable.

"His abilities as a painter appear in his works, which will not only be admired by his contemporaries, but by their posterity ; as his tints, like those of Rubens and \ andyck, instead of being impaired, are improved by time, which some of them have now withstood above 60 years. His idea of beauty, when he indul¬ ged his fancy, was of the highest kind ; and his know¬ ledge of perspective gave him great advantages in fa¬ mily-pieces, of which he painted more than any one of his time.

"Hill, Aaron, a poet of considerable eminence, the son of a gentleman of Malmesbury-abbey in Wilt¬ shire, was born in 1685. His father’s imprudence having cut off his paternal inheritance, he left Westminster school at 14 years of age j and embarked for Constan¬ tinople, to visit Lord Paget the English ambassador there, who was his distant relation. Lord Paget recei¬ ved him with surprise and pleasure, provided him a tu¬ tor, and sent him to travel : by which opportunity he saw Egypt, Palestine, and a great part of the east; and returning home with his noble patron, visited most of the courts of Europe. About the year 1709, he pub¬ lished his first poem entitled Camillus, in honour of the earl of Peterborough who had been general in Spain j and being the same year made master of Drury-lane theatre, he wrote his first tragedy Elfred, or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master of the opera- house in the Hay-market $ when he wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which met with great success, being the first that Mr Handel set to music after he came to England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a pro¬ jector as well as poet, and in 17*5 obtained a patent for extracting oil from bcech-nuts ; which underta¬ king, whether good or bad, miscarried after engaging three years of his attention. He was also concerned in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia ; from which he never reaped any advantage ; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of Scotland, on a scheme of applying the woods there to ship-building 5 in which he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived in perfect harmony with all the writers of his time, except Mr Pope, with whom he had a short pa¬ per-war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the Dunciad, as one of the competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of Hulness, in the follow¬ ing lines: “ Then Hill essay’d $ scarce vanished out of sight, “ He buoys up instant, and returns to light ; “ He bears no token of the sabler streams, “ And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.’, This, though far the gentlest piece of satire in the whole poem, and conveying at the same time an oblique complimeat, roused Mr Hill to take some notice of it ; which he did by a poem written during his peregrina¬ tion in the north, entitled, “ The Progress of Wit, a Caveat for the use of an eminent writer which he begins with the following eight lines, in which Mr Pope’s too well known disposition is elegantly, yet very severely characterized : ** Tuneful Alexis on the Thames’ fair side, “ The Ladies play-thing, and the Muses pride j “ With merit popular, with wit polite, “ Easy tho’ vain, and elegant tho’ light} “ Desiring and deserving others praise, “ Poorly accepts a Fame he ne’er repays : “ Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves j “ And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves.” The sneakingly approves, in the last couplet, Mr Pope was much affected by; and indeed through their whole controversy afterwards, in which it was generally thought that Mr Hill had much the advantage, Mr Pope seems rather to express his repentance by denying the offence, than to vindicate himself supposing it to have been given. Besides the above poems, Mr Hill, among many others, wrote one, called The northern star, upon the actions of Czar Peter the Great; for which he was several years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from the empress Catharine, according to the Czar’s desire before his death. He likewise alter¬ ed some of Shakespeare’s plays, and translated some of Voltaire’s. His last production was Merope ; which was brought upon the stage in Drury-lane by Mr Gar¬ rick. He died on the 8th of February 1749, as it is said, in the very minute of the earthquake $ and af¬ ter his decease four volumes of his works in prose and verse were published in octavo, and bis dramatic works in two volumes","Westminster, Palestine, Peterborough","US,EG,ES,GE,GB,UK",6,"United States,Egypt,Spain,Georgia,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Africa,Europe,Asia,Europe,N/A"

"These are attended by two genu, who watch every in¬ dividual of the human race ; Chiter’s spy being on the right, and Gopt’s on the left. The souls of de- ceased persons are carried by the Jambouts or mes¬ sengers of death into the presence of Durham, where their actions are instantly proclaimed, and sentence pas¬ sed accordingly. The infernal mansions are named by the Hindoos Narekha, and are divided into a great number of places, according to the degrees of punish¬ ment to be endured by the criminal ; hut eternal pu¬ nishment for any offence is supposed to be inconsistent with the goodness of God. Instead of this, the Hin¬ doos suppose that after the souls of the wicked have been punished long enough in Narekha, they are sent back into the world to animate other bodies either of men or beasts, according to circumstances. Those who have lived a life partly goodjand partly bad, are likewise sent back to this world ; and these trials and transmi¬ grations are repeated till they be thoroughly purged of all inclination to sin. But as for those holy men who have spent their lives in piety and devotion, they are instantly conveyed by the genii to the mansions of ce¬ lestial bliss, where they are absorbed into the universal spirit; a state, according to every idea we can form, equivalent to annihilation ! 8.

"Besides the supreme deities the Hindoos have a number of demigods, who are supposed to inhabit the air, the earth, and the waters, and in short the whole world 5 so that every mountain, river, wood, town, village, &c. has one of these tutelar deities, as was the case among the western heathens. By nature these demigods are subject to death, but are supposed to obtain immortality by the use of a certain drink named Amrut. Their exploits in many instances resemble those of Bacchus, Hercules, Theseus, &c. and in a beautiful epic poem named Rancyan, we have an account of the wars of Ram, one of the demigods, with Ravana tyrant of Ceylon",Hercules,US,6,United States,North America

He did not, however, disturb the succession to the throne, but left Mahmud in quiet possession of it, reserving to himself only that of the Panjab country. The death of Mahmud, which hap¬ pened in 1413, put an end to what is called the Patan dynasty, founded by Cuttub in 1205. He was suc¬ ceeded by Chizer, who derived hi§ pedigree from the impostor Mohammed, and his posterity continued to enjoy it till the year 1450 $ when Belloli, an Afghan of the tribe of Lodi, took possession of it, the reigning prince Alla H. having abdicated the government. Un¬ der him all Hindostan was divided into separate states; and a prince, whose title was the king of the east, who resided at Jionpour in the province of Allahabad, became so formidable, that the king of Delhi had only a shadow of authority remaining to him. A consi¬ derable part of the empire, however, was recovered by the son of Belloli ; who, in the year 1501, fixed his royal residence at Agra. During his reign the Portu¬ guese first accomplished the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, but they had no connection with any other part of Hindostan than some maritime places in the Deccan which had always been independent of the court of Delhi.

"Another source of reproach to the British govern¬ ment in India was, that the court of directors in Eng¬ land became infested with the same spirit ot party and contention which pervaded all other departments ot the state. Lord Clive and Mr Sullivan were the two great leaders of these party disputes ; and as the in¬ terest of the one or the other prevailed, different per¬ sons were appointed to the administration, and differ¬ ent measures adopted. The event of all this was, that whenever a new administration was formed, the first object was to condemn the measures of those who had gone before him. Thus, in the year 1764* when Lord Clive was made governor of Bengal, the new di¬ rectors represented the affairs of the company as in the worst situation imaginable, from which they could on¬ ly be extricated by the abilities of Clive. On the ar¬ rival of the latter in the east, he took care to write home reports to the same purpose, and to condemn in the most violent manner every thing that had been done} the whole body of the company’s servants were censured indiscriminately without being allowed any means of defence, as they were in truth ignorant of the charges brought against them.

It now consisted of a gover¬ nor-general and four counsellors j three of whom were sent from England j two being military gentlemen of high rank, and the third a gentleman employed in the war-office. On their arrival they proceeded in the same manner that Lord Clive had done before them : they pronounced in the most decisive manner, that the company’s affairs were in a ruinous state j and that every species of corruption had been practised by the former government. This general accusation, unsup¬ ported by any kind of evidence, was the constant theme of the dispatches sent by them to England j and thus has the reputation of the British government suffered exceedingly through the unwarrantable liber¬ ties which its own servants have been allowed to take with one another. It must also be considered, that from the remote situation of India, and the unavoid¬ able ignorance of its affairs on that account, it was easy for any person, whose malicious purposes it might suit, to prejudice the public against the servants of the company Hi istan H I N company to as great a degree as he pleased",Clive,"IN,GB,US",6,"India,United Kingdom,United States","Asia,Europe,North America"

"HIPPOCRATES, the greatest physician of anti¬ quity, was born in the island of Cos in the 80th Olym¬ piad, and flourished at the time of the Peloponnesian war. He rvas the first that we know of who laid down precepts concerning physic ; and, if we may believe the author of his life, who goes under the name of Soranus, drew his original from Hercules and iFAculapius. He was first a pupil of his own father Heraclides, then of Herodicns, then of Gorgias of Leontinum the orator, and, according to some, of Democritus of Abdera",Hercules,US,6,United States,North America
"he found all his fellow citizens so, and Demociitus the jji]>po«ra- only wise man among them. He heard many lectures, 1 and learned much philosophy from him $ which has made Cornelius Celsus and some others imagine, that Hippocrates was the disciple of Democritus, though it is probable they never saw each other till this interview which was occasioned by the Abderites. Hippocrates had also public invitations to other countries. Thus, when a plague invaded the Illyrians and Paeonians, the kings of those countries begged him to come to their relief: he did not go ; but learning from the messen¬ gers the course of the winds there, he concluded that the distemper would come to Athens; and foretelling what would happen, applied himself to take care of the city and the students. He was indeed such a lover of Greece, that when his fame had reached as far as Per¬ sia, and upon that account Artaxerxes had intreattd him by his governor of the Hellespont, with a pro¬ mise of great rewards, to come to him, he refused to go. He also delivered his own country from a war with the Athenians, that was just ready to break out, by prevailing with the Thessalians to come to their as¬ sistance, for which he received very great honours from the Coans. The Athenians also conferred great honours upon him : they admitted him next to Her¬ cules in the Eleusinian ceremonies ; gave him the free¬ dom of the city ; and voted a public maintenance for him and his family in the prytaneum or council-house at Athens, where none were maintained at the public charge, but such as had done public service to the state","Athens, Athens","US,GR",6,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"This island, famous for being the earliest settlement of the Spaniards in the New world, was at first in high estimation for the quantity of gold it supplied: this wealth diminished with the inhabitants of the country, whom they obliged to dig it out of the bowels of the earth 3, H I S [ 504 ] H I S earth ; and the source of it was entirely dried up, when ' they were exterminated, which was quickly done by a series of the most shocking barbarities that ever dis¬ graced the history of any nation. Benzoni relates, that of two millions of inhabitants, contained in the island when discovered by Columbus in 1493* scaice *,-53 were alive in 1545. A vehement desire of opening again this source of wealth inspired the thought of get¬ ting slaves from Africa ; but, besides that these were found unfit for the labours they were destined to, the multitude of mines, which then began, to be wrought on the continent, made those of Hispaniola no longer of any importance. An idea now suggested itself, that their negroes, which were healthy, strong, and patient, might be usefully employed in husbandry j and they adopted, through necessity, a wise resolution, which, had they known their own interest, they would have embraced by choice",Columbus,US,6,United States,North America
"The first misfortune arose from the depopulation of the island. The Spanish conquests on the continent should naturally have contributed to promote the suc¬ cess of an island, which nature seemed to have formed to be the centre of that vast dominion arising around it, to be the staple of the different colonies. But it fell out quite otherwise : on a view of the immense fortunes raising in Mexico, and other parts, the richest inhabitants of Hispaniola began to despise their set¬ tlements, and quitted the true source of riches, which is on the surface of the earth, to go and ransack the bowels of it for veins of gold, which are quickly ex-Hlspaniok hausted. The government endeavoured in vain to put —r— a stop to this emigration j the laws were always either artfully eluded, or openly violated",,MX,6,Mexico,North America
"This colony, which had no longer any intercourse with the mother country but by a single ship of no great burthen, that arrived from thence every third year, consisted, in of 18,410 inhabitants, including Spaniards, mestees, negroes, or mulattoes. The com¬ plexion and character of these people differed according to the different proportions of American, European, and African blood they had received from that natural and transient union which restores all races and condi¬ tions to the same level. These demi-savages, plunged in the extreme of sloth, lived upon fruits and roots, dwelt in cottages without furniture, and most of them without clothes. The few among them, in whom in¬ dolence had not totally suppressed the sense of decency and taste for the conveniencies of life, purchased clothes of their neighbours the French in return for their cattle, and the money sent to them for the maintenance of two hundred soldiers, the priests, and the government",,"US,FR",6,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"This spirit, however, still continued to exert itself, and the assembly of France having avowed its design not to interfere with the internal affairs of the colony, discontent and remonstrances were exhibited by the factious friends of the negroes. They considered this as countenancing the African trade, and an acknow¬ ledgment that the planters were not colonists, but in¬ dependent people. This idea struck the colonists them¬ selves, for by a decree they debarred the king’s dele¬ gate from having a negative on any of their future acts. The Amis des Noirs, in the mean time, exerted all their influence to kindle and cherish a spirit of re¬ bellion in the minds of the people of colour; for which purpose they carefully taught one James Oge, then re¬ siding at Paris, the doctrines of equality and the rights of man, urged him to return to St Domingo, place him¬ self at the head of his people, and rescue them from the oppression of the whites, pledging themselves to procure arms and ammunition for him in America, that the affair might be kept as profound a secret as possi¬ ble. He accordingly set sail for New England in July 1790; but all the vigilance of the parties concerned could not deceive the government of France, and his portrait w'as sent to St Domingo before him. He made the island in October, and declared soon after by vir¬ tue of a manifesto, that if the privileges of the whites were not conferred on all without discrimination, he would instantly take up arms to obtain them by force",Paris,"FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The news of these transactions having reached Paris, the members of the assembly were persuaded that they had carried their principles of equality by much too far, and they repealed their celebrated decree which had placed the people of colour on a footing with the whites.

"With regard to the study of history, we must con-Of the it* sider, that all the revolutions which have happened in^I0^' the world have been owing to two causes. 1. The£t0,3r' connexions between the different states existing toge¬ ther in the world at the same time, or their different situations with regard to one another; and, 2. The different characters of the people who in all ages constituted these states, their different geniuses and dispositions, &c. by which they were either prompted to undertake such and such actions of themselves, or were easily induced to it by others. The person who would study history, therefore, ought in the first place to make himself acquainted with the state of the world in general in all different ages; what nations inhabited the different parts of it; what their extent of territory was; at what particular time they arose, and when they declined. He is then to inform himself 0! the various events which have happened to each par¬ ticular nation; and, in so doing, he will discover many of the causes of those revolutions, which before he only knew as facts. Thus, for instance, a per¬ son may know the Roman history from the time of Romulus, without knowing in the least why the city ot Rome happened to be built at that time.

At this time Greece was divided into a number of small principalities, most of which seem to have been in subjection to Agamem¬ non king of Mycenae.

"In 740 B. C. however, the Syrian empire was totally destroyed by Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria ; as was also the kingdom of Samaria by Shalmaneser his suc¬ cessor in 721 B. C. The people were either massacred, or carried into captivity into Media, Persia, and the countries about the Caspian sea. 15 While the nations of the east were thus destroying Of the each other, the foundations of very formidable em- Western pires were laid in the west, which in process of timeIlallons' were to swallow up almost all the eastern ones. In Africa, Carthage was founded by a Tyrian colony, about 869 B. C. according to those who ascribe the highest antiquity to that city ; but, according to others, it was founded only in 769 or 770 B. C. In Europe a very considerable revolution took place about 900 B. C. The Heraclidae, whom we have formerly seen expelled from Greece by Atreus the father of Aga¬ memnon, after several unsuccessful attempts, at last conquered the whole Peloponnesus. From this time the Grecian states became more civilized, and their hi¬ story becomes less obscure. The institution, or rather the revival and continuance, of the Olympic games, in 776 B. C. also greatly facilitated the writing not only of their history, but that of other nations ; for as each Olympiad consisted of four years, the chronology of every important event became indubitably fixed by re¬ ferring it to such and such an Olympiad.

"The Asiatics have in all ages been much inferior to the European nations in valour and military skill. They were now sunk in luxury and effeminacy $ and what was worse, they seem at this period to have been seized with that infatuation and distraction of councils which scarce ever fails to be a forerunner of the destruction of any nation. The Persian ministers persuaded their sovereign to reject the prudent advice that was given Sect. I him, of distressing Alexander by laying waste the conn- £jTii try, and thus forcing him to return for want of provi- History, sions. Nay, they even prevented him from engaging the enemy in the most proper manner, by dividing his forces ; and persuaded him to put Charidemus the A- thenian to death, who had promised with 100,000 men, of whom one-third were mercenaries, to drive the Greeks out of Asia. In short, Alexander met with only two checks in his Persian expedition. The one was from the city of Tyre, which for seven months re¬ sisted his utmost efforts; the other was from Memnon the Rhodian, who had undertaken to invade Macedo¬ nia. The first of these obstacles Alexander at last got over, and treated the governor and inhabitants with the utmost cruelty. The other was scarce felt; for Memnon died after reducing some of the Grecian islands, and Darius had no other general capable of conducting the undertaking. The power of the Per¬ sian empire was totally broken by the victory gained over Darius at Arbela in 331 B. C. and next year a total end was put to it by the murder of the king by Bessus one of his subjects. 55 The ambition of Alexander was not to be satisfied H*8 con- with the possession of the kingdom of Persia, or indeed^|, °ft of any other on earth. Nothing less than the total ^5 subjection of the word itself seemed sufficient to him ; and therefore he was now prompted to invade every country of which he could only learn the name, whe¬ ther it had belonged to the Persians or not. In con¬ sequence of this disposition, he invaded and reduced Hy rcania, Bactria, Sogdia, and all that vast tract of country now called Bukharia. At last, having entered India, he reduced all the nations to the river Hypha- sis, one of the branches of the Indus. But when he would have proceeded farther, and extended his con¬ quests quite to the eastern extremities of Asia, his troops positively refused to follow him farther, and he was constrained to return. In 323 B. C. this mighty conqueror died of a fever ; without having time to settle the affairs of his vast extended empire, or even to name his successor. . ^ While the Grecian empire thus suddenly sprung np^81^ in the east, the rival states of Rome and Carthage iveremans making considerable advances in the west. The Ro¬ mans were establishing their empire on the most solid foundations ; to which their particular situation natu¬ rally contributed. Being originally little better than a parcel of lawless banditti, they were despised and hated by the neighbouring states. This soon produced wars; in which, at first from accidental circumstances, and af¬ terwards from their superior valour and conduct, the Romans proved almost constantly victorious. The jea¬ lousies which prevailed among the Italian states, and their ignorance of their true interest, prevented them from combining against that aspiring nation, and crush¬ ing it in its infancy, which they might easily have done ; while in the mean time the Romans being kept in a state of continual warfare, became at last such ex¬ pert soldiers, that no other state on earth could resist them. During the time of their kings they had made a very considerable figure among the Italian nations; but after their expulsion, and the commencement ot the republic, their conquests became much more rapid and extensive. In 501 B. C. they subdued the Sabines; eight years after, the Latins; and in 399 B- C* l.he I S. t.

In a short I’. time Rome was rebuilt with much greater splendor than before, but now a general revolt and combina¬ tion of the nations formerly subdued took place. The Romans, however, still got the better of their ene¬ mies j but, even at the time of the celebrated Camil- lus’s death, which happened about 352 B. C. their territories scarce extended six or seven leagues from the capital. The republic from the beginning was agitated by those dissensions which at last proved its ruin. The people had been divided by Romulus into two classes, namely, Patr icians and Plebeians, answer¬ ing to our nobility and commonalty. Between these two bodies were perpetual jealousies and contentions ; which retarded the progress of the Roman conquests, and revived the hopes of the nations they had conquer¬ ed. The tribunes of the people were perpetually op¬ posing the consuls and military tribunes. The senate had often recourse to a dictator endowed with absolute power; and then the valour and experience of the Ro¬ man troops made them victorious j but the return of domestic seditions gave the subjugated nations an op¬ portunity of shaking off the yoke. Thus had the Romans continued for near 400 years, running the same round of wars with the same enemies, and reap¬ ing very little advantage from their conquests, till at last matters were compounded by choosing one of the consuls from among the plebeians; and from this time chiefly we may date the prosperity of Rome, so that by the time that Alexander the Great died they were held in considerable estimation among foreign nations","Rome, Romulus, Roman, Rome","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"Gar- The Carthaginians in the mean time continued to ians, enrich themselves by commerce $ but, being less con- Si- versant in military affairs, were by no means equal to the Romans in power, though they excelled them in wealth. A new state, however, makes its appearance during this period, which may be said to have taught the Carthaginians the art of war, and, by bringing them into the neighbourhood of the Romans, proved the first source of contention between these two power¬ ful nations. This was the island of Sicily. At what time people were first settled on it, is not now to be ascertained. The first inhabitants we read of were called Sicani, Siculi, Leestrigones, &c. but of these we know little or nothing. In the second year of the 17th Olympiad, or 710 B. C. some Greek colonies are said to have arrived on the island, and in a short time founded several cities, of which Syracuse was the chief. The Syracusans at last subdued the original inhabitants: though it doth not appear that the lat¬ ter were ever well affected to their government, and therefore were on all occasions ready to revolt. The first considerable prince, or (as he is called by the Greeks) tyrant of Syracuse, was Gelon, who obtained the sovereignty about the year 483 B. C. At what time the Carthaginians first carried their arms into Si¬ cily is not certainly known j only we are assured, that Vql. X. Part II. f 513 they possessed some part of the island as early as 505 B. C. lor in the time of the first consuls, the Ro¬ mans and Carthaginians entered into a treaty chiefly in regard to matters of navigation and commerce j by which it was stipulated, that the Romans who should touch at Sardinia, or that part of Sicily which belong¬ ed to Carthage, should be received there in the same manner as the Carthaginians themselves. Whence it appears, that the dominion of Carthage already extend¬ ed over Sardinia and part of Sicily : but in 28 years after, they had been totally driven out by Gelon : which probably was the first exploit performed by him","Syracuse, Syracuse, Carthage, Carthage","US,TN,GR",6,"United States,Tunisia,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"
"at the same time ready to fall to pieces for want of a proper head j the western world filled with fierce and savage nations, whom the rival republics of Carthage and Rome were preparing to enslave as fast as they could. The first remarkable events took place in the Macedonian empire.—Alexander, as already observed, had not distinctly named any successor 5 but he had left behind him a victorious, and, we may say, invin¬ cible army, commanded by most expert officers, all of them ambitious of supreme authority. It is not to be supposed that peace could long be preserved in such a situation. For a number of years, indeed, nothing was to be seen or heard of but the most horrid slaughters, and wickedness of every kind, until at last the mother, wives, children, brothers, and even sisters, of Alexander, were cut oft j not one of the family of that great con¬ queror being left alive.

"The Romans had no sooner made themselves masters of Italy, than they wanted only a pretence to carry their arms out of it, and this pretence was soon found out. Being invited into Sicily to assist the Mamer- tines against Hiero king of Syracuse and the Car¬ thaginians, they immediately commenced a war with the latter, which continued with the utmost fury for 23 years. The war ended greatly to the disadvantage of the Carthaginians, chiefly owing to the bad con¬ duct of their generals, none of whom, Hamilcar Bar¬ cas alone excepted, seem to have been possessed of any degree of military skill *, and the state had suffered too many misfortunes before he entered upon the command, for him or any other to retrieve it at that time. The consequence of this war was the entire loss of Sicily to the Carthaginians ; and soon after the Romans seized on the island of Sardinia",Syracuse,"IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"Hamilcar perceiving that there was now no alter¬ native, but that in a short time either Carthage must conquer Rome, or Rome would conquer Carthage, bethought himself of a method by which his country might become equal to that haughty republic. This was by reducing all Spain, in which the Carthaginians had already considerable possessions, and from the mines of which they drew great advantages. He had, therefore, no sooner finished the war with the mercenaries, which succeeded that with the Romans, than he set about the conquest of Spain. This, how¬ ever, he did not live to accomplish, though he made great progress in it. His son Asdrubal continued the war with success j till at last the Romans, jealous of O R Y. Sect, his progress, persuaded him to enter into a treaty with civil ( them, by which he engaged himself to make the river Histor ' Iberus the boundary of his conquests. This treaty'T** probably was never ratified by the senate of Carthage, nor, though it had, would it have been regarded by Hannibal, who succeeded Asdrubal in the command, and had sworn perpetual enmity with the Romans","Carthage, Rome, Rome, Carthage, Carthage, Hannibal","TN,US,ES",6,"Tunisia,United States,Spain","Africa,North America,Europe"
"The transactions of the second Punic war are perhaps the most remarkable which the history of the world can afford. Certain it is, that nothing can show more clearly the slight foundations upon which the greatest empires are built. We now see the Romans, the na¬ tion most remarkable for their military skill in the whole world, and who, for more than 500 years, had been constantly victorious, unable to resist the efforts of one single man. At the same time we see this man, though evidently the first general in the world, lost solely for want of a slight support. In former times, the republic of Carthage supplied her generals in Si¬ cily with hundreds of thousands, though their enter¬ prises were almost constantly unsuccessful j but now Hannibal, the conqueror of Italy, was obliged to abandon his design, merely for want of 20 or 30,000 men. That degeneracy and infatuation, which never fails to overwhelm a falling nation, or rather which is the cause of its fall, had now infected the counsels of Carthage, and the supplies were denied. Neither was Carthage the only infatuated nation at this time.—» Hannibal, whose prudence never forsook him either in prosperity or adversity, in the height of his good fortune had concluded an alliance with Philip king of Macedon. Had that prince sent an army to the as¬ sistance of the Carthaginians in Italy immediately after the battle of Cannse, there can be no doubt but the Romans would have been forced to accept of thatjgeef((i 1 peace which they so haughtily refused J j and indeed,u | this offer of peace, in the midst of so much success, is 124","Carthage, Hannibal, Carthage, Carthage, Hannibal","TN,IT,US",6,"Tunisia,Italy,United States","Africa,Europe,North America"

Philip, however, could not be roused from his indolence, nor see that his own ruin was connected with that of Carthage. The Ro¬ mans had now made themselves masters of Sicily ; after which they recalled Marcellos, with his victorious ar¬ my, to be employed against Hannibal j. and the con¬ sequence at last was, that the Carthaginian armies, | unsupported in Italy, could not conquer it, but were recalled into Africa, which the Romans had invaded","Carthage, Hannibal","IT,TN,US",6,"Italy,Tunisia,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"The southern nations seem to have been as blind to their own interest as the northern ones.

It is true, the Car¬ thaginians were giving no offence ; nay, they even made the most abject submissions to the republic of Rome; but all was not sufficient. War was declared a third time against that unfortunate state $ there was now no Hannibal to command their armies, and the city was utterly destroyed 146 B. C.

Their downfal, however, did not happen within the period of which we now treat.—The only other transaction which makes any considerable figure m the Syrian empire is the oppression of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanes.

"This revolution, however, was of no long continu¬ ance. In 167 B. C. Mattathias restored the true worship in most of the cities of Judea ; and in 168 the temple was purified, and the worship there restored by Judas Maccabseus. This was followed by along series of wars between the Syrians and Jews, in which the latter were almost always victorious ; and before these wars were finished, the destruction of Carthage happen¬ ed, which puts an end to the sixth general period for¬ merly mentioned. 32 7. The beginning of the seventh period presents us Seventh pe- with a view of the ruins of the Greek empire in the declining states of Syria and Egypt j both of them of^ much circumscribed in bounds. The empire of Syria world, at first comprehended all Asia to the river Indus, and beyond it j but in 312 B. C. most of the Indian pro¬ vinces were by Seleucus ceded to one Sandrocottus, or Androcottus, a native, who in return gave him 500 elephants. Of the empire of Sandrocottus we know nothing farther than that he subdued all the countries between the Indus and the Ganges ; so that from this time we may reckon the greatest part of India inde¬ pendent on the Syro-Macedonian princes. In 250 B. C. however, the empire sustained a much greater loss by the revolt of the Parthians and Bactrians from Antiochus Theus. The former could not be subdued j and as they held in subjection to them the vast tract which now goes under the name of Persia, we must look upon their defection as an irreparable loss. Whe¬ ther any part of their country was afterwards recover¬ ed by the kings of Egypt or Syria is not very certain ; nor is it of much consequence, since we are assured that in the beginning of the seventh period, i. e. 146 B. C. the Greek empires of Syria and Egypt were reduced by the loss of India, Persia, Armenia, Pon- tus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Pergamus, &c. The ge¬ neral state of the world in 146 B. C. therefore was as follows. In Asia were the empires of India, Par- thia, and Syria, with the lesser states of Armenia, Pontus, &c. above mentioned j to which we must add that of Arabia, which during the sixth period had grown into some consequence, and had maintained its independency from the days of Ishmael the son of Abraham. In Africa were the kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia; the Carthaginian territories now sub¬ ject to the Romans ; and the kingdoms of Numidia, Mauritania, and Getulia, ready to be swallowed up by the same ambitious and insatiable power, now that Carthage was destroyed, which served as a barrier a- gainst it. To the south lay some unknown and bar¬ barous nations, secure by reason of their situation and insignificance, rather than their strength, or distance from Rome. In Europe we find none to oppose the progress of the Roman arms, except the Gauls, Ger- 3 T 2 mans, 5i6 Civil History","Carthage, Asia, Of, Carthage, Rome, Roman","SY,EG,IN,AM,TN,GR,ET,MR,PH,TR,US,RO",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,Egypt,India,Armenia,Tunisia,Greece,Ethiopia,Mauritania,Philippines,Turkey,United States,Romania","Asia,Africa,Asia,Asia,Africa,Europe,Africa,Africa,Asia,Asia,North America,Europe"

"The disturbances did not cease with the death of Gracchus. New contests ensued on account of the Sempronian law, and the giving to the Italian allies the privilege of Roman citizens. This last not only produced great commotions in the city, but occasioned a general revolt of the states of Italy against the re¬ public of Rome. This rebellion wras not quelled with¬ out the utmost difficulty ; and in the mean time, the city was deluged with blood by the contending factions of Sylla and Marius ; the former of whom sided with the patricians, and the latter with the plebeians.

The efforts of Brutus and Cassius were therefore unsuccessful, and ended in their own destruction and that of great numbers of their followers in the battle of Philippi.

"In the 98th year of the Christian era, Trajan was created emperor of Rome ; and being a man of great valour and experience in war, carried the Roman con¬ quests to their utmost extent.

"Thus was the Roman empire divided into four parts 3 which by all historians is said to have been productive of the greatest mischiefs. As each of these four sovereigns would have as many officers both civil and military, and the same number of forces that had been maintained by the state when governed only by one emperor, the people were not able to pay the sums necessary for supporting them. Hence the taxes and imposts were increased beyond measure, the inhabitants in several provinces reduced to beggary, the laud left untilled for want of hands, &c. An end was put to these evils when the empire was again united under Constantine the Great j but in 330 a mortal blow was given it, by removing the imperial seat to Byzantium, now Constantinople, and making it equal to Rome","Roman, Constantine, Rome","RO,DZ,US",6,"Romania,Algeria,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"Some of the Roman emperors indeed withstood this inundation of savages ; but as the latter grew daily more numerous, and the Romans continued to weaken themselves by their intestine divisions, they were at last obliged to take large bodies of barbarians into their pay, and teach them their military discipline, in order to drive away their countrymen, or others who invaded the empire. This at last proved its total de¬ struction } for, in 476, the barbarians who served in the Roman armies, and were dignified with the title of allies, demanded the third part of the lands of Italy as a reward for their services : but meeting with a re¬ fusal, they revolted, and made themselves masters of the whole country, and of Rome itself, which from that time ceased to be the head of an empire of any consequence","Roman, Roman, Rome","RO,IT,US",6,"Romania,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

""" While the barbarians of the east were thus grasping at the empire of the whole world, great disturbances happened among the no less barbarous nations of the west. Superstition seems to have been the ruling mo¬ tive in both cases. The Saracens and Turks conquer¬ ed for the glory of God, or of his apostle Mahomet and his successors j the western nations professed an equal regard for the divine glory, but which was only to be perceived in the respect they paid to the pope and clergy. Ever since the establishment of Christi¬ anity by Constantine, the bishops of Rome had been gradually extending their power j and attempting not only to render themselves independent, hut even to as¬ sume an authority over the emperors themselves. The destruction of the empire was so far from weakening their power, that it afforded them opportunities of greatly extending it, and becoming judges of the sovereigns of Italy themselves, whose barbarity and ignorance prompted them to submit to their decisions. All this time, however, they themselves had been in subjec¬ tion to the emperors of Constantinople j but on the decline of that empire, they found means to get themselves exempted from this subjection. The prin¬ cipal authority in the city of Rome was then engross¬ ed by the bishop j though of right it belonged to the duke appointed by the exarch of Ravenna.

"Some time before, a quarrel had happened between Civil History O R Y. Sect. ] the pope (Gregory II.) and Leo emperor of the east, about the worship of images. Leo, who it seems, in the midst of so much barbarism, bad still preserved ’ some share of common sense and reason, reprobated the worship of images in the strongest terms, and com¬ manded them to be destroyed throughout his domi¬ nions. The pope, whose cause was favoured by the most absurd superstitions, and by these only, refused to obey the emperor’s commands. The exarch of Ravenna, as a subject of the emperor, was ordered to force the pope to a compliance, and even to seize or as¬ sassinate him in case of a refusal. ’I his excited the pious zeal of Luitprand to assist the pope, whom he had formerly designed to subdue: the exarch w7as first excommunicated, and then torn in pieces by the enra¬ ged multitude: the duke of Naples shared the same fate; and a vast number of the Iconoclasts, or Image- breakers, as they were called, were slaughtered with¬ out mercy: and to complete all, the subjects of the exarchate, at the instigation of the Pope, renounced their allegiance to the emperor","Ravenna, Naples","IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"Leo was no sooner informed of this revolt than he ordered a powerful army to be raised, in order to re¬ duce the rebels, and take vengeance on the Pope. A- larmed at these warlike preparations, Gregory looked round for some power on which he might depend for protection. The Lombards were possessed of suffi¬ cient force, hut they were too near and too danger¬ ous neighbours to be trusted) the Venetians, though zealous Catholics, were as yet unable to withstand the force of the empire ) Spain was overrun by the Sa¬ racens : the French seemed, therefore, the only peo¬ ple to whom it was advisable to apply for aid) as they were able to oppose the emperor, and were likewise enemies to his edict. Charles Martel, who at that time governed France as mayor of the palace, was therefore applied to; hut before a treaty could be concluded, all the parties concerned were removed by, death. Constantine Copronymus, who succeeded Leo at Constantinople, not only persisted in the opposition to image-worship begun by his predecessor, but pro¬ hibited also the invocation of saints. Zachary, who succeeded Gregory III. in the pontificate, proved as zealous an adversary as his predecessor. Pepin, who succeeded Charles Martel in the sovereignty of France, proved as powerful a friend to the pope as his father had been. The people of Rome had nothing to fear from Constantinople; and therefore drove out all the emperor’s officers. The Lombards, awed by the power of France, for some time allowed the pope to govern in peace the dominions of the exarchate; hot in 752, Astolphus king of Lombardy not only re¬ duced the greatest part of the pope’s territories, but threatened the city of Rome itself.

The superstition of Omar the second caliph had prompted him to invade this country, part of the territories of the Greek empe¬ ror, who was doing him no hurt; and now when it had been so long under the subjection of the Mahometans, a similar superstition prompted the pope to send an army for the recovery of it. The crusaders accordingly poured forth in multitudes, like those with which the kings of Persia formerly invaded Greece ; and their fate w'as pretty similar. Their impetuous valour at first, indeed, carried every thing before them ; they reco¬ vered all Palestine, Phoenicia, and part of Syria, from the infidels ; but their want of conduct soon lost what their valour had obtained, and very few of that vast multitude which had left Europe ever returned to their native countries. A second, a third, and several other crusades, were preached, and were attended with a like success in both respects : vast numbers took the cross, and repaired to the Holy Land ; which they polluted with the most abominable massacres and treacheries, and from which very few of them returned. In the third crusade Richard I. of England was embarked, who seems to have been the best general that ever went into the east: but even his valour and skill were not sufficient to repair the faults of his companions; and he was obliged to return even after he had entirely de¬ feated his antagonists, and was within sight of Jeru¬ salem","Ho, Palestine","GR,SY,GH,US",6,"Greece,Syrian Arab Republic,Ghana,United States","Europe,Asia,Africa,North America"

"To enrich themselves either by the gold and silver produced in these countries, or by traffic with the natives, now became the object. The Portuguese had the advantage of being the first discoverers of the east¬ ern, and the Spaniards of the western countries. The former did not neglect so favourable an opportunity of enriching themselves by commerce. Many settlements were formed by them in the East India islands, and on the continent *, but their avarice and perfidious beha¬ viour towards the natives proved at last the cause of their total expulsion. The Spaniards enriched them¬ selves by the vast quantities of the precious metals im¬ ported from America, which were not obtained but by the most horrid massacres committed on the natives, and of which an account is given under the different names of the American countries. These possessions of the Spaniards and Portuguese soon excited other Euro¬ pean nations to make attempts to share with them in their treasures, by planting colonies in different parts of America, and making settlements in the East Indies : and thus has the rage of war in some measure been transferred from Europe to these distant regions; and, after various contests, the British at last obtained a great superiority both in America and the East Indies",,"US,PT,GB",6,"United States,Portugal,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"

"The pestilent superstition was for a while suppressed : but it revived again, and spread, not only over Jiukta, where this evil was first broached, but readied Rome, whither from every quarter of the earth is constantly flowing whatever is hideous and abominable amongst men, and is there readily embraced and practised",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"First, therefore, were apprehended such as openly avowed themselves to be of that sect; then by them were discovered an immense multitude; and all were convicted, not of the crime of burning Rome, hut of hatred and enmity to mankind. Their death and tor¬ tures were aggravated by cruel derision and sport; for they were either covered with the skins of wild beasts and torn in pieces by devouring dogs, or fastened to crosses, or wrapped up in combustible garments, that, when the day-light failed, they might, like torches, serve to dispel the darkness of the night. Hence, to¬ wards the miserable sufferers, however guilty and de¬ serving the most exemplary punishment, compassion arose ; seeing they were doomed to perish not with a view to the public good, but to gratify the cruelty of one man.” That this account of Tacitus is downright misre¬ presentation and calumny, must be evident to every one who reads it. It is impossible that any person can be convicted of hatred and enmky to mankind, with¬ out specifying a number of facts by which this ha¬ tred showed itself.

They persuaded the peo¬ ple, that die ministers of the Christian church succeed¬ ed to the character, rights, and privileges, of the Jewish priesthood ; and accordingly the bishops considered themselves as invested with a rank and character simi¬ lar to those of the high priest among the Jews, while the presbyters represented the priests, and the deacons the Levites.

"lac: ie of This event, however, so favourable to the outward its rap. peace of the church, was far from promoting its inter- lioB nal harmony, or the reformation of its leaders. The clergy, who had all this time been augmenting their power at the expence of the liberty of the people, now set no bounds to their ambition. The bishop of Rome, v/as the first in rank, and distinguished by a sort of pre-eminency above the rest of the prelates. He sur¬ passed all his brethren in the magnificence and splen¬ dour of the church over which he presided, in tire riches of his revenues and possessions, in the number and variety of his ministers, in his credit with the people, and in his sumptuous and splendid manner of living. Hence it happened, that when a new pontiff was to be chosen by the presbyters and people, the city of Rome was generally agitated with dissensions, tumults, and cabals, which often produced fatal conse¬ quences. The intrigues and disturbances which pre¬ vailed in that city in the year 366, when, upon the death of Liberius, another pontiff was to be chosen in his place, are a sufficient proof of what we have ad¬ vanced. Upon that occasion, one faction elected Da- masus to that high dignity; while the opposite party « Vol, X.

"In the ecclesiastical commonwealth, indeed, they were the most eminent order of citizens ; but still they were citizens as well as their brethren, and subject, like them, to the laws and edicts of the emperors. AH re¬ ligious causes of extraordinary importance were exa¬ mined and determined either by judges appointed by the emperors, or in councils assembled for that pur¬ pose ; while those of inferior moment were decided in each district by its respective bishop. The ecclesiasti¬ cal laws were enacted either by the emperor or coun¬ cils. None of the bishops acknowledged that they de¬ rived their authority from the permission and appoint¬ ment of the bishop of Rome, or that they were created bishops by the favour of the apostolic see. On the con¬ trary, they all maintained that they were the ambassa¬ dors and ministers of Jesus Christ, and that their au¬ thority was derived from above. It must, however, he observed, that even in this century several of those steps were laid by which the bishops of Rome mounted afterwards to the summit of ecclesiastical power and despotism. This happened partly by the imprudence of the emperors, partly by the dexterity of the Ro¬ man prelates themselves, and partly by the inconside¬ rate zeal and precipitate judgment of certain bishops","Rome, Rome",US,6,United States,North America
"The imprudence of the emperor, and precipitation of the bishops, were remarkably discovered in the follow¬ ing event, which favoured extremely the ambition of the Roman pontiff. About the year 372, Valentinian enacted a law, empowering the bishop of Rome to ex¬ amine and judge other bishops, that religious disputes might not be decided by any profane or secular judges","Roman, Rome","RO,US",6,"Romania,United States","Europe,North America"
"The bishops assembled in council at Rome io 378, not considering the fatal consequences that must arise from this imprudent law both to themselves and to the church, declared their approbation in the strongest terms, and recommended the execution of it in their address to the emperor Gratian. Some think, indeed, that this law empowered the Roman bishop to judge only the bishops within the limits of his jurisdiction ; others, that his power was given only for a certain time, and for a particular purpose. This last notion seems the most probable j but still this privilege must have been an excellent instrument in the hands of sa¬ cerdotal ambition. g-g By the removal of the seat of empire to Constanti-Bishops of nople, the emperor raised up, in the bishop of this ^'ome an.d new metropolis, a formidable opponent to the bishope^^ai of Rome, and a bulwark which threatened a vigorous ea£h opposition to his growing authority.

"HIST world so Its bishop, measuring his own dignity and rank by the magnificence of the new city, and its eminence as the residence of the emperor, assumed an equal degree of dignity with the bishop of Home, and claimed a superiority over the rest of the episcopa or¬ der. Nor did the emperors disapprove of these higli pretensions, since they considered their own dignity as connected in a certain measure with that of the bis.iop of their imperial city. Accordingly, in a council held at Constantinople in the year 381, by the authority of Theodosius the Great, the bishop of that city was, durin""-the absence of the bishop of Alexandria, and against the consent of the Homan prelate, placed >y the third canon of that council in the first ran^t alter the bishop of Home, and consequently above those of Alexandria and Antioch. Nectanus was the first bi¬ shop who enjoyed these new honours accumulated up¬ on the see of Constantinople. His successor, the cele¬ brated John Chrysostom, extended still farther the privileges of that see, and submitted to its jurisdiction all Thrace, Asia, and Pontus; nor were the succeed¬ ing bishops of that imperial city destitute of a fervent zeal to augment their privileges and extend their do¬ minion. By this unexpected promotion, the most dis¬ agreeable effects were produced. '1 be bishops of Alex¬ andria were not only filled with the most inveterate ha¬ tred against those of Constantinople, but contention was excited between the bishops of Rome and Constantino¬ ple *, which, after being carried on for many ages, con¬ cluded at last in the separation of the Greek and La¬ tin churches","Alexandria, Alexandria, Antioch, Asia, Rome","US,PH,GR",6,"United States,Philippines,Greece","North America,Asia,Europe"
"Constantine the Great, in order to prevent civil com- • motions, and to fix his authority on a stable and solid foundation, made several changes not only in the laws of the empire, but also in the form of the Roman go¬ vernment. And as there were many important reasons which induced him to suit the administration of the church to these changes in the civil constitution,' this necessarily introduced among the bishops new degrees of eminence and rank. The four bishops, of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, were distin¬ guished by a certain degree of pre-eminence over the rest. These four prelates answered to the four prae¬ torian prefects created by Constantine *, and it is pos¬ sible, that even in this century they were distinguished by the Jewish title of patriarchs. After these followed the exarchs, who had the inspection of several pro¬ vinces, and answered to the appointment of certain ci¬ vil officers who bore the same title. In a lower class were the metropolitans, who had only the government of one province j under whom were the archbishops, whose inspection was confined to certain districts. In this gradation the bishops brought up the rear ; but the sphere of their authority was not in all places equally extensive ; being in some considerably ample, and in others confined within narrow limits. To these va¬ rious ecclesiastical orders we might add that of the chorepiscopi, or superintendents of the country churches j but this last order was in most places suppressed by the bishops, with a design to extend their own autho¬ rity, and enlarge the sphere of their power and juris¬ diction. The administration of the church itself was divided by Constantine into an external and internalm- spection.

"Those more particularly of the presbyters and deacons who filled the first stations of these orders, carried their pretensions to an extravagant length, and were offend¬ ed at the notion of being placed on an equality with their colleagues. For this reason they not only assu¬ med the titles of arch-presbyters, and arch-deacons, but also claimed a degree of authority and power much su¬ perior to that which was vested in the other members of their respective orders. 7’ In the fifth century, the bishops of Constantinople having already reduced under their jurisdiction all t^e Asiatic provinces, began to grasp at still further acces- f Ronlc sions of power. By the 28th canon ol the council held al)(j con at Cbalcedon in 451, it was resolved, that the sametiantk6! rights and honours which had been conferred on the bishop of Rome were due to the bishop of Constanti¬ nople, on account of the equal dignity and lustre ot the two cities in which these prelates exercised their authority",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"£ csia- atilliority. The same council confirmed also, by a so- cal lemn act, the bishop of Constantinople in the spiritual 1 too- government of those provinces over which he had u v usurped the jurisdiction. Leo the Great, bishop of Kome, opposed with vehemence the passing of these laws j and his opposition was seconded by that of se¬ veral other prelates. But their elforts were vain, as the emperors threw in their weight into the balance, and thus supported the decisions of the Grecian bi¬ shops. In consequence, then, of the decisions of this famous council, the bishop of Constantinople began to contend obstinately for the supremacy with the Ho¬ man pontiff, and to crush the bishops of Antioch and Alexandria. About the same time, Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem, attempted to withdraw himself and his church from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Caesarea, and aspired after a place among the first prelates of the Christian world. The high degree of veneration and esteem in which the church of Jerusalem was held among all other Christian societies (on account of its rank among the apostolical churches, and its title to the appellation of mother-church, as having succeeded the first Christian assembly formed by the apostles), was extremely favourable to the ambition of Juvenal, and rendered bis project much more practicable than it would otherwise have been. Encouraged by this, and likewise by the protection of Theodosius the younger, this aspiring prelate not only assumed the dignity of patriarcli of all Palestine, a rank which rendered him independent-of all spiritual authority j but also invad¬ ed the rights of the bishop of Antioch, and usurped his jurisdiction over the provinces of Phoenicia and Arabia","Ho, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Palestine, Antioch","US,IL,GH",6,"United States,Israel,Ghana","North America,Asia,Africa"

"In 588, John, bishop of Constantinople, surnamed the Faster, either by his own authority or that of the emperor Mauritius, summoned a council at Constanti- noole to acquire into an accusation brought against Gregory, bishop of Antioch; and upon this occasion as¬ sumed the title of oecumenical ox universal bishop.

On the other hand, it is certain, from a va- riety of the most authentic records, that both the em¬ perors and the nations in general were far from being disposed to bear with patience the yoke of servitude which the see of Rome was arrogantly imposing on the whole church",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"In the eighth century, the power of the bishop of Rome, and of the clergy in general, increased prodi¬ giously. The chief cause of this, besides the supersti¬ tion of the people, was the method at that time used by the European princes to secure themselves on their thrones. All these princes being then employed either in usurpation or in self-defence, and the whole continent being in the most unsettled and barbarous condition, they endeavoured to attach warmly to their interests these whom they considered as their friends and clients. For this purpose they distributed among them extensive territories, cities, and fortresses, with the various rights and privileges belonging to them ; reserving only to themsel ves the supreme dominion, and the military service of these powerful vassals. For this reason it was by the European princes reckoned a high instance of political prudence to distribute among the bishops and other Christian doctors the same sort of donations which had formerly been given to their ge¬ nerals and clients. By means of the clergy, they hoped to check the seditious and turbulent spirits of their vassals ; and to maintain them in their obedience by the influence and authority of their bishops, whose commands were highly respected, and whose spiritual thunderbolts, rendered formidable by ignorance, struck terror into the boldest and most resolute hearts",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"This prodigious accession to the opulence and au¬ thority of the clergy in the west, began at their head, viz. the Roman pontiff; from whence it spread gra¬ dually among the inferior sacerdotal orders. The bar¬ barous nations who had received the gospel, looked up¬ on the bishop of Rome as the successor of their chief druid or high priest : and as this tremendous druid had enjoyed, under the darkness of Paganism, a kind of boundless authority ; so these barbarous nations thought proper to confer upon the chief bishop the same authority which had belonged to the chief druid","Roman, Rome","RO,US",6,"Romania,United States","Europe,North America"
"The pope received these august privileges with great pleasure ; and lest, upon any change of affairs, at¬ tempts should be made to deprive him of them, he strengthened his title to these extraordinary honours by a variety of passages drawn from ancient history, and, what is still more astonishing, by arguments of a religious nature. This swelled the Roman druid to an enormous size ; and gave to the see of Rome that high pre-eminence and despotic authority in civil and 3 * 2 political 532 HISTORY",Rome,US,6,United States,North America
"For this purpose he assembled the states in 751 ; and though they were devoted to the interests of this am¬ bitious usurper, they gave it as their opinion that the bishop of Rome was previously to be consulted whether the execution of such a scheme was lawful or not. In consequence of this, ambassadors were sent by Pepin to Zachary, the reigning pontiff, with the follow¬ ing question, “ Whether the divine law dkl not per¬ mit a valiant and warlike people to dethrone a pu¬ sillanimous and indolent pHnce who was incapable of discharging any of the functions of royalty j and to 73 He becomes substitute in his place one more worthy to rule, and Ecclesia- who had already rendered most important services to stical the state ?” The situation of Zachary, who stood much , Hl5t0fy- in need of the succours of Pepin against the Greeks * ^ and Lombards, rendered bis answer such as the usurper desired : and when this favourable decision of the Ro¬ man oracle was published in France, the unhappy Childeric was stripped of his royalty without the least opposition •, and Pepin, without the smallest resistance, stepped into the throne of his master and his sove¬ reign. This decision was solemnly confirmed by Ste¬ phen II. the successor of Zachary $ who undertook a journey into France in the year 754, in order to so¬ licit assistance against the Lombards. The pontiff at the same time dissolved the obligation of the oath of fidelity and allegiance which Pepin had sworn to Chil¬ deric, and violated by his usurpation in the year 751 } and to render his title to the crown as sacred as pos¬ sible, Stephen anointed and crowned him, with his wife and two sons, for the second time. This complaisance of the pope was rewarded with the exarchate of Ra¬ venna and all its dependencies, as we have already re¬ lated. See Civil History, N° 44. supra; and History of Italy. 74 In the succeeding centuries, the Roman pontiffs con-His power tinned to increase their power by every kind of artifice still increa and fraud which can dishonour the heart of man ; and,s€? by continually taking advantage of the civil dissensions which prevailed throughout Italy, France, and Ger¬ many, their influence in civil affairs rose to an enor¬ mous height. The increase of their authority in reli¬ gious matters was not less rapid. The wisest and most impartial among the Roman Catholic writers acknow¬ ledge, that from the time of Louis the Meek the an¬ cient rules of ecclesiastical government were gradually changed in Europe by the counsels and instigation of the church of Rome, and new laws substituted in their place. The European princes suffered themselves to bo divested of the supreme authority in religious matters, which they had derived from Charlemagne $ the power of the bishops was greatly diminished, and even the authority of both provincial and general councils began to decline. The popes, elated with their overgrown prosperity, and become arrogant beyond measure by the daily accessions that were made to their authority, were eagerly bent upon establishing the maxim, That the bishop of Rome was constituted and appointed by Jesus Christ supreme legislator and judge of the church universal $ and that therefore the bishops derived all their authority from him. This opinion, which they inculcated with the utmost zeal and ardour, was oppo¬ sed in vain by such as wei*e acquainted with the ancient ecclesiastical constitutions, and the government of the church in the earlier ages. In order to gain credit to this new ecclesiastical code, and to support the preten¬ sions of the popes to supremacy, it was necessary to pro¬ duce the authority of ancient deeds, in order to stop the mouths of such as were disposed to set bounds to their usurpations. The bishops of Rome were aware of this j and as those means were looked upon as the most law¬ ful that tended best to the accomplishment of their purposes, they employed some of their most ingenious and zealous partisans in forging conventions, acts of councils, epistles, and such like records, by which it might appear, that in the first ages of the church the Roman","Rome, Roman, Rome, Rome, Rome, Roman","US,FR,IT,RO",6,"United States,France,Italy,Romania","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"more contrary to true religion, it is an opinion which prevailed in the eighth century, namely, That Chri¬ stians might appease an offended Deity by voluntary acts of mortification, or by gifts and oblations lavish¬ ed on the church ; and that people ought to place their confidence in the works and merits of the saints. 1 he piety in this and some succeeding ages consisted in building and embellishing churches and chapels; in en¬ dowing monasteries and basilics ; hunting after the re¬ lics of saints and martyrs, and treating them with an absurd and excessive veneration ; in procuring the in¬ tercession of the saints by rich oblations, or super¬ stitious rites ; in worshipping images ; in pilgrimages to those places which were esteemed holy, particu¬ larly to Palestine, &c. The genuine religion of Jesus was now utterly unknown both to clergy and people, if we except a few of its general doctrines contained in the creed. In this century also, the superstitious custom of solitary masses had its origin. These were celebrated by the priest alone in behalf of souls de¬ tained in purgatory, as well as upon some other occa¬ sions.

An universal panic ensued; vast num¬ bers of people, abandoning all their connections in so¬ ciety, and giving over to the churches and monasteries all their worldly effects, repaired to Palestine, where they imagined that Christ would descend from heaven to judge the world. Others devoted themselves by a solemn and voluntary oath to the service of the churches, convents, and priesthood, whose slaves they became, in the most rigorous sense of that word, performing daily their heavy tasks ; and all this from a notion that the supreme Judge would diminish the severity of their sentence, and look upon them with a more favourable and propitious eye, on account of their having made themselves the slaves of his ministers. When an eclipse of the sun or moon happened to be visible, the cities were deserted, and their miserable inhabitants fled for refuge to hollow caverns, and hid themselves among the craggy rocks, and under the bending summits of steep mountains.

But these complaints and demands were not carried to such a length as to produce any good effect; since they came from persons who never entertained the least doubt a- bout the supreme authority of the pope in religious mat¬ ters, and who, of consequence, instead of attempting themselves to bring about that reformation which was so ardently desired, remained entirely inactive, or look¬ ed for redress to the court of Rome, or to a general council. But while the so much desired reformation seemed to be at such a great distance, it suddenly arose from a quarter whence it was not at all expected. A single person, Martin Luther, a monk of the order of St Augustine, ventured to oppose himself to the whole torrent of papal power and despotism. This bold at¬ tempt was first made public on the 30th of Sept, ; and notwithstanding all the efforts of the pope and his adherents, the doctrines of Luther continued daily to gain ground. Others, encouraged by his success, lent their assistance in the work of reformation; which at last produced new churches, founded upon principles quite diflerent from that of Rome, and which still continue","Rome, Rome",US,6,United States,North America

Such a re¬ lation must not only be very agreeable to his country¬ men the Grecians, for whose sakes it was written j but likewise very instructive, by informing them of the jus¬ tice of Providence in punishing public injuries in this world, wherein societies, as such, are only capable of punishment. And therefore those examples might be of use to caution them against the like practices. On the contrary, Thucydides begins his history with the un¬ happy state of his countrymen the Athenians j and in 3 Y the 538 H I S 1 Composi. the course of it plainly intimates, that they were the lion of cause of the calamitous war between them and the , '*‘^or-v’ ^ Lacedaemonians. Whereas, had he been more inclined mmmym t0 please and gratify his countrymen than to write the truth, he might have set things in such a light as to have made their enemies appear the aggressors",Providence,US,6,United States,North America
"Cicero observes very justly, that history “ is conver¬ sant in great and memorable actions.” For this rea¬ son, an historian should always keep posterity in viewj and relate nothing which may not, upon some account or other, be worth the notice of after-ages. To de¬ scend to trivial and minute matters, such as frequently occur in the common affairs of life, is below the dig¬ nity of history. Such writers ought rather to be deemed journalists than historians, who have no view or ex¬ pectation that their works should survive them. But the skilful historian is fired with a more noble ambi¬ tion. His design is to acquaint succeeding ages with what remarkable occurrences happened in the world before them j to do justice to the memory of great and virtuous men $ and at the same time to perpetuate his own. Pliny the younger has some fine reflections upon this head, in a letter to a friend. “ You advise me (says he) to write a history $ and not you only, tor many others have done the same, and I am myself inclined to it. Not that I believe myself qualified for it, which would be rash to think till I have tried it; but because I esteem it a generous action not to suffer those to be forgotten whose memory ought to be eter¬ nised j and to perpetuate the names of others, together with one’s own. For there is nothing I am so desirous or ambitious of, as to be remembered hereafter j which is a thing worthy of a man, especially of one who, con¬ scious of no guilt, has nothing to fear from posterity",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"But on the other hand it must be owned, that there are many inconveniencies which attend it $ some of which are mentioned by Cicero. “ If (says he) there is any thing commendable, persons are obliged to speak of themselves with greater modesty, and to omit what is blameable in others. Besides, what is said is not so soon credited, and has less authority ; and after all, Ai vn. many not stick to censure it.” And Pliny says very well to the same purpose, “ Those who proclaim ep. . their own virtues, are thought not so much to proclaim them because they did them, as to have done them that they might proclaim them. So that which would have appeared great if told by another, is lost when related by the party himself. For when men cannot deny the fact, they reflect upon the vanity of its author. Where¬ fore, if you do things not worth mentioning, the actions themselves are blamed 5 and if the things you do are Lj .j;j commendable, you are blamed for mentioning them.” cp. These reflections will be generally allowed to be very just; and yet considering how natural it is for men to love themselves, and to be inclined in their own favour, it seems to be a very difficult task for any one to write an impartial history of his own actions. There is scarce any treatise of this kind that is more celebrated than Caesar’s Commentaries. And yet Suetonius tells us, that “ Asinius Pollio (who lived at that time) thought they were neither written with due care nor integrity : that Caesar was often too credulous in his accounts of what was done by other persons; and misrepresented his own actions, either designedly, or through forget¬ fulness ; and therefore he supposes he would have re¬ vised and corrected them.” However, at some times it may doubtless be justifiable for a person to be his own historian. Plutarch mentions two cases wherein it is allowable for a man to commend himself, and be the publisher of his own merits. These are, when the doing of it may be of considerable advantage ei¬ ther to himself or others. It is indeed less invidious for other persons to undertake the province. And especially for a person to talk or write of his own vir¬ tues, at a time when vice and a general corruption of manners prevails, let what he says be ever so true, it will be apt at least to be taken as a reflection upon others. “ Anciently (says Tacitus), many wrote their own lives, rather as a testimony of their conduct, than from pride.” Upon which he makes this judicious re¬ mark : “ That the more virtue abounds, the sooner the reports of it are credited.” But the ancient writers had a way of taking off the reader’s attention from themselves in recording their own actions, and so ren¬ dering what they said less invidious*, and that was, by speaking of themselves in the third person, and not in the first. Thus Csesar never says, “ I did,” or “ I said, this or that;” but always, “ Ccesar did, or said, so and so.” Why the moderns have not more chosen to fol¬ low them in this, we know not, since it seems less ex¬ ceptionable",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"si. siclers the causes of actions, and what were the designs >f and views of those persons who were principally con- y- cerned in them. Some, as Polybius has well observed, are apt to confound the beginnings of actions with their springs and causes, which ought to be carefully separated. For the causes are often very remote, and to be looked for at a considerable distance from the ac¬ tions themselves. Thus, as he tells us, some have re¬ presented Hannibal’s besieging Saguntum in Spain, and passing the Ebro, contrary to a former agreement between the Romans and Carthaginians, as causes of the second Punic war. But these were only the begin¬ nings of it. The true causes were the jealousies and fears of the Carthaginians from the growing power of the Romans ; and Hannibal’s inveterate hatred to them, with which he had been impressed from his in¬ fancy. For his father, whom he succeeded in the com¬ mand of the Carthaginian army, had obliged him, when but nine years old, to take a most solemn oath upon an altar never to be reconciled to the Romans : and therefore he was no sooner at the head of the army, than he took the first opportunity to break with them","Hannibal, Hannibal","US,ES",6,"United States,Spain","North America,Europe"
"That was left for his son. But as King Philip could not have done this without first bringing the other states of Greece into it, his pretence to them was only to avenge the injuries they had all suffered from the lei- sians j though the real design was an universal govern¬ ment, both over them and the Persians, as appeared af¬ terwards by the event. But in order to our being well assured of a person’s real designs, and to make the ac¬ counts of them more credible, it is proper we should be acquainted with his disposition, manners, way ot life, virtues, or vices j that by comparing his actions with these, we may see how far they agree and suit each other. For this reason Sallust is so particular in his description of Catiline, and Livy of Hannibal ; by which it appears credible, that the one was capable of entering into such a conspiracy against his country, and the other of performing such great things as are re¬ lated concerning him. But if the causes of actions lie in the dark, and unknown, a prudent historian will not trouble himself or his readers with vain and trifling conjectures, unless something very probable oilers it¬ self",Hannibal,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"c. S-l HIST observation that Livy makes upon the ill-conduct of Hannibal in quartering his army in Capua after the battle of Cannae $ by which means they lost their mar¬ tial vigour through luxury and ease. “ Those (says he) who are skilled in military affairs reckoned this a greater fault in the general, than his not marching his army immediately to Rome after his victory at Cannae j for such a delay might have seemed only to defer the victory, but this ill step deprived him of the power to gain it.” The modesty of the historian in this passage is worth remarking, in that he does not represent this as his own private opinion, and by that means under¬ take to censure the conduct of so great a general as Hannibal was, but as the sense of those who were skill¬ ed in such affairs. However, a historian should be brief in such remarks j and consider, that although he does not exceed his province by applauding virtue, ex¬ pressing a just indignation against vice, and interposing his judgment upon the nature and consequences of the facts he relates 5 yet there ought to be a difference be¬ tween his reflections and the encomiums or declamations of an orator","Hannibal, Capua, Rome, Hannibal","US,IT",6,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"III. Speeches inserted by historians. These are of two sorts, oblique and direct. The former are such as the historian recites in his own person, and not in that of the speaker. Of this kind is that of Hannibal in Justin $ by which he endeavours to persuade King Antiochus to carry the seat of the war against the Ro¬ mans into Italy. It runs thus : “ Having desired jjli- bevty to speak, he said none of the present counsels and designs pleased him j nor did he approve of Greece for the seat of the war, which might be managed in Italy to greater advantage : because it was impossible to conquer the Romans but by their own arms, or to subdue Italy but by its own forces; since both the nature of those men, and of that war, was different from all others. In other wars, it was of great importance to gain an advantage of place or time, to ravage the coun¬ tries and plunder the towns; but though you gain some advantage over the Romans, or defeat them, you must still fight with them when beaten. Wherefore, should any one engage with them in Italy, it was possible for him to conquer them by their own power, strength, and arms, as he himself had done ; but should he attempt it out of Italy, the source of their power, he would be as much deceived, as if he endeavoured to alter the course of a river, not at the fountain-head, but where its streams were largest and deepest. This was his judgment in private, and what he had offered as his advice, and now repeated in the presence of his friends; that all might know in what manner a war ought to be carried on against the Romans, who were invincible abroad, but might be conquered at home. For they might sooner be driven out of their city than their em¬ pire, and from Italy than their provinces ; having been taken by the Gauls, and almost subdued by himself","Of, Hannibal","IT,GR,TR,US",6,"Italy,Greece,Turkey,United States","Europe,Europe,Asia,North America"
"The reason offered against direct speeches is, because they are not true; and truth is the foundation of all history, from which it never ought to depart. Such speeches, therefore, are said to weaken the credit of the writer ; since he who will tell us that another person spoke such things which he does not know that he ever did speak, and in such language as lie could not use, may take the same liberty in represent¬ ing his actions. Thus, for example, when Livy gives us the speeches of Romulus, the Sabine women, Bru¬ tus, and others, in the first ages of the Roman state, both the things themselves are imaginary, and the language wholly disagreeable to the times in which those persons lived. Accordingly we find, that when several historians relate some particular speech of the same person, they widely differ both in the subject- matter and expressions. So the speech of Veturia, by which she dissuaded her son Coriolanus from be¬ sieging Rome when he came against it with an army !m- ir ed III.

"Thus we find that short letter of Lerttulus to Catiline at the time of his conspiracy differently related by CicefO and Sftllust. The reason of which seems to be this : That as Cicero recited It publicly to the people of Home in his third oration against Catiline, it is rea¬ sonable to imagine he did it it) the very words of the letter, which he had by him; whereas Sallust, as an historian, might think it sufficient to give the sense of it in his own words",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"Cicero observes, that i(, nothing is more agreeable inj)^ cte history than brevity of expression, joined with puntyOrflt c 3 and perspicuity.” Purity indeed is not peculiar to his¬ tory, but yet it is absolutely necessary; ffir no one will ever think him fit to write a history who is not master of the language in which he writes: and there¬ fore when Albinus had written a history of the Roman affairs in Greek, and apologised for any slips or impro¬ prieties that might be found in the language upon the account of his being a Roman, Cato called him a triner, for choosing to do that which, after he had done it, he was obliged to ask pardon for doing. Nor is perspi-fr: c cuity less requisite in an historical style. Hie nature o the ""subject plainly directs to this. For as history con¬ sists principally in narration, clearness and perspicuity are nowhere more necessary than in a relation of iacts","Cicero, Roman, Roman","RO,US,GR",6,"Romania,United States,Greece","Europe,North America,Europe"
"'*■ Again, Cicero, treating of an historical style, says: llli' “ It ought to be fluent, smooth, and even, free from ^ ’ that harshness and poignancy which is usual at the bar.” The properties here mentioned distinguish this style from that of judicial discourses, in which the ora¬ tor often finds it necessary to vary his manner of speak¬ ing, in order to answer different views, either of pursu¬ ing an argument, pressing an adversary, addressing a judge, or recommending the merits of his cause. This occasions an inequality in his style, while he speaks sometimes directly, at other times by way of question, and intermixes short and concise expressions with round and flowing periods. But the historian has no necessi¬ ty for such variations in his style. It is his province to espouse no party, to have neither friend nor foe, but to appear wholly disinterested and indifferent to all j and therefore his language should be smooth and equal iu his relations of persons and their actions",Cicero,US,6,United States,North America
"Vol. X. Part II. f 545 Now from these several properties laid down by an- Composi- cient writers, as requisite for an historical style, it seems tion of upon the whole to agree best with the middle charac-. Bi!8t0|y- ter. And this will further appear, by what they say v relating to the ornamental parts of style ; namely, com¬ position and dignity. As to the former of these, which respects the structure of sentences, and the several parts of them, Demetrius remarks, that “ An historical pe¬ riod ought neither to rise very high, nor sink very low, but to preserve a medium.” This simplicity (he says) “ becomes the gravity and credit of history j and dis¬ tinguishes it from oratory on the one hand, and dia¬ logue on the other.” His meaning is, that historical periods should neither be so full and sonorous as is fre¬ quent in oratory : nor yet so short and flat as in dia¬ logue : the former of which, as he says, require a strong voice to pronounce them} and the latter have scarce the appearance of periods. So that, according to this judicious writer, the periods best suited for history are those which, being of a moderate length, will admit of a just rise and cadency, and may he pronounced with ease. And Dionysius tells us, that “ History should flow smooth and even, everywhere consistent with itself, without roughness or chasms in the sound.” This re¬ lates to the harmony of periods, which arises from such a position of the words as renders the sound pleasant and agreeable, and as he thinks ought to be attended to in history. And as to dignity, which respects the use of tropes and figures, the same author says, that “ History should be embellished with such figures as are neither vehement nor carry in them the appearance of art.” This is agreeable to what Cicero observes, in comparing Xenophon and Calisthenes, two Greek his¬ torians. “ Xenophon the Socratic (says he) was the first philosopher, and after him Calisthenes the scholar of Aristotle, who wrote an history: the latter almost like a rhetorician : but the style of the former is more moderate, and has not the force of an orator, less vehe¬ ment perhaps, but in my opinion more sweet and plea¬ sant.” The difference between these two writers, with j)c Orat, regard to their style, consisted chiefly in the choice ofbb. ii",Cicero,"US,GR",6,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"their figures : which in Xenophon were more gentlec‘ I4* and moderate, and therefore in the judgment of Cicero more agreeable to history. Now these several proper¬ ties relating to the ornaments of language, as well as those before mentioned, which by ancient writers have been thought requisite for history, are all suited to the middle style, as we have elsewhere shown at large.

"HOADLEY, Benjamin, successively bishop of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester, was born in 1676. His first preferment in the church was the rectory of St Peter le Poor, and the lectureship of St Mildred’s in the Poultry. In the year 1706, he published some Remarks on the late Bishop Atterbury’s sermon at the funeral of Mr Bennet, in which Dr At- terbury had, in the opinion of Mr Hoadley, laid down some dangerous propositions. Two years after, Mr Hoadley again entered the lists against this formi¬ dable antagonist j and in his exceptions against a ser¬ mon published by Dr Atterbury, intitled “ The Power of Charity to Cover Sin,” he attacked the doctor with his usual strength of reasoning and dispassionate in¬ quiry.

Soon after the ac¬ cession of King George I. MrHoadley was consecrated to the see of Bangor} and, 1717, having broached some opinions concerning the nature of Christ’s king¬ dom, &c. he again became the object of popular cla¬ mour. At this juncture he was distinguished by an¬ other particular mark of the royal regard, by means of which the convocation was successively prorogued, and it was not permitted to sit, or do any business, till that resentment was entirely subsided. In 1721 he was translated to Hereford ; and from thence, in 1723, to Salisbury. In 1734, he was translated to Winchester (on the demise of Dr Willis), and pub¬ lished his Plain Account of the Sacrament: a perform¬ ance which served as a butt for his adversaries to shoot at; yet impartiality owns it to be clear, rational, and manly, written with great candour and judgment, and suited to the capacity of every serious and considerate inquirer after truth.—His latter days were embittered - by a most vile instance of fraud and ingratitude. The bishop took a French priest, who pretended to abjure his religion, under his protection, with no other re¬ commendation than that of his necessities; in return for which act of humanity, the priest found an opportunity of getting the bishop’s name written by his own hand, and, causing a note of some thousand pounds to be placed before it, offered it in payment. But the bishop deny¬ ing it to be his, it was brought before a court of justice, and was there found to be a gross imposition. The un¬ grateful villain had now recourse to a pamphlet, in which he charged the bishop with being a drunkard ; and alleged that he had the note of him when he was in liquor. To this calumny the bishop made a full and nervous answer; in which he exposed the man’s falsehood, and solemnly averred that he was never drunk in his whole life. The world with becoming ardour embraced bis defence, and he had the happi¬ ness to find himself perfectly acquitted even of any suspicion of such a charge. As a writer, he possessed uncommon abilities. His sermons (published in 1754 and 1755) are esteemed inferior to few writings in the English language, for plainness and perspicuity, ener¬ gy and strength of reasoning, and a free and masterly manner. In private life, he was naturally facetious, easy, and complying ; fond of company, yet would frequently leave it for the purposes of study or devo¬ tion. He was everywhere happy ; and particularly in his own family, where he took all opportunities of instructing by his influence and example. He died in 1761, aged 83. Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote, 1. Terms of Acceptance, 8vo. 2. Reason¬ ableness of Conformity. 3. On the Sacrament.

"HOBBES, Thomas, a political writer, was born at Malmsbury in 1588. He was the son of a clergyman ; and having completed his studies at Oxford, he was af¬ terwards governor to the eldest son of William Caven¬ dish earl of Devonshire. He travelled through France and Italy with that young nobleman, and at length ap¬ plied himself entirely to ""the study of polite literature",Oxford,"FR,IT,US",6,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"In 1631, the countess dowager of Devonshire desired to put the young earl under his care, who was then 3 ^ 2 about HOB [ 548 3 HOB Hobbes, about the age of 13. This was very suitable to Mr -v-— Hobbes’s inclinations, who discharged that trust with great fidelity and diligence. In 1634, he republished his translation of Thucydides, and prefixed to it a de¬ dication to tiiat young nobleman, in which he gives a great character of his father, and represents in the strongest terms the obligations he was under to that illustrious family. The same year he accompanied his noble pupil to Paris, where he applied his vacant hours to the study of natural philosophy, and more especially to the perfect understanding of mechanism, and the causes of animal motion. He had frequent conversa¬ tions upon these subjects with Father Marin Mersenne $ a man deservedly famous, and who kept up a corre¬ spondence with almost all the learned in Europe. From Paris he attended his pupil into Italy, where at Pisa he became known to that great astronomer Galileo Gali¬ lei, who communicated to him his notions very freely $ and after having seen all that was remarkable in that country, he returned with the earl of Devonshire into England. Afterwards, foreseeing the civil wars, he went to seek a retreat at Paris ; where, by the good offices of his friend Father Mersenne, he became known to the famous Renatus des Cartes, and afterwards held a correspondence with him upon several mathematical subjects, as appears from the letters of Mr Hobbes pub¬ lished in the works of Des Cartes. But when this philosopher printed afterwards his Meditations, where¬ in he attempted to establish points of the highest conse¬ quence from innate ideas, Mr Hobbes took the liberty of dissenting from him; as did also the French king’s mathematical professor, the illustrious Peter Gassendi, with whom Mr Hobbes contracted a very close friend¬ ship, which was not interrupted till the death of the former. In 1642, Mr Hobbes printed a few copies of his famous hook De Give, which, in proportion as it became known, raised him many adversaries, who charged him with instilling principles which had a dangerous tendency. Among many illustrious persons who, upon shipwreck of the royal cause, retired to France for safety, was Sir Charles Cavendish, brother to the duke of Newcastle ; and this gentleman, being skilled in every branch of the mathematics, proved a constant friend and patron to Mr Hobbes $ who, by embarking in 1645 in a controversy about squaring the circle, was grown so famous for it, that in 1647 was recommended to instruct Charles prince of Wales, afterwards King Charles II. in mathematical learning","Paris, Paris, Pisa, Paris, Newcastle","US,IT,FR,ZA",6,"United States,Italy,France,South Africa","North America,Europe,Europe,Africa"
"His care in the discharge of this office gained him the esteem of that prince in a very high degree : and though lie afterwards withdrew his public favour to Mr Hobbes on account of his writings, yet he always retained a sense of the services he had done him 51 showed him various marks of his favour after he was restored to his dominions \ and, as some say, had his picture hanging in his closet. This year also was printed in Holland, by the care of M. Sorbiere, a second and more com¬ plete edition of his book De CzW; to which are pre¬ fixed two Latin letters to the editor, the one by Mr Gassendi, the other by Father Mersenne, in commen¬ dation of it: and in 1650 was published at London a small treatise of Mr Hobbes’s, entitled Human Nature ; and another He corpore politico, or “ Of the elements qf the law.” AU this time Mr Hobbes had been digesting with great care and pains his religious, political, and moral principles, into a complete system, which he called the ^ Leviathan, and which was printed in English at Lou¬ don in 1650 and 1651. After the publication of his Leviathan he returned to England, and passed the sum¬ mer commonly at his patron the earl of Devonshire’s seat in Derbyshire, and some of his winters in town, where he had for his intimate friends some of the great¬ est men of the age. In 1660, upon the Restoration, he quitted the country, and came up to London, where he obtained from the king assurance of protection, and had an annual pension of look settled upon him out of the privy purse. Yet this did not render him en¬ tirely safe : for, in 1666, his Leviathan and his trea¬ tise He Give were censured by parliament j which alarmed him very much, as did also the bringing in of a bill into the house of commons to punish atheism and profaneness. When this storm was a little blown over,, he began to think of procuring a beautiful edition of his pieces that were in Latin $ but finding this im¬ practicable in England, be caused it to be undertaken abroad, where they were published in quarto in 1668, from the press of John Bleau. In 1669, he was vi¬ sited by Cosmo de Medicis, then prince, afterwards duke of Tuscany, who gave him ample marks of his esteem and respect; and having received his picture, and a complete collection of his writings, caused them to be reposited, the former among his curiosities, the latter in his noble library at Florence. The like visits he received from foreign ambassadors and other strangers of distinction j who were curious to see a person whose singular opinions and numerous writings had made so much noise all over Europe. In 1672, he wrote his own life in Latin verse, when, as he observes, he had completed his 84th year: and, in 1674, he published in English verse four books of Homer’s Odyssey; which was so well received, that it encouraged him to under¬ take the whole Iliad and Odyssey, which he likewise performed and published in 1675. About this time he took his leave of London, and went to spend the remainder of his days in Derbyshire : where, however, he did not remain inactive, notwithstanding his ad¬ vanced age ; hut published from time to time several pieces, to be found in the collection of his works. He died in 1679, aSe^ 92, As to his character and manners, they are thus de¬ scribed by Dr White Kennet, in his Memoirs of the Cavendish family. “ The earl of Devonshire (says he) for his whole life entertained Mr Hobbes in his family, as his old tutor rather than as his friend or confidant. He let him live under his rool in ease and plenty, and in his own way, without making use of him in any public, or so much as domestic affairs. He would frequently put off the mention of his name, and say, ‘ He was a humorist, and nobody could account for him.’ There is a tradition in the family, of the manners and customs of Mr Hobbes, somewhat obser¬ vable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to his exercise, and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore, at his first rising, he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach $ or if the weather was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, to be in a sweat: recom¬ mending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had more moisture than heat, and therefore by such IJoi.hr HOB [ 549 3 HOC ] jbes, such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture ex- bby. pelted. Alter this, he took a comfortable breakfast $ ’ ’ ' and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the children, and any consider¬ able strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He kept these rounds till about 12 o’clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he ate always by himself without ceremony. Soon af¬ ter dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle with 10 or 12 pipes of tobacco laid by him ; then shut¬ ting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and wri¬ ting for several hours. He retained a friend or two at court, and especially the lord Arlington, to protect him if occasion should require. He used to say, that it was lawful to make use of ill instruments to do our¬ selves good : * If I were cast (says he) into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to be drawn out by it.’ After the Re¬ storation, he watched all opportunities to ingratiate himself with the king and his prime ministers; and look¬ ed upon his pension to be more valuable, as an earnest of favour and protection, than upon any other account","Holland, London, Of, London, Florence, London, Arlington","US,GB,UK,TR",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A,Turkey","North America,Europe,N/A,Asia"

Whenever the earl removed, he would go along with him, even to his last stage, from Chatsworth to Hardwick. When he was in a very weak condition, he dared not to be left behind, but made his way upon a feather-bed in a coach, though he survived the jour¬ ney but a few days. He could not bear any discourse of death, and seemed to cast off all thoughts of it. He delighted to reckon upon longer life. The winter be¬ fore he died, he made a warm coat, which he said must last him three years, and then he would have such ano¬ ther. In his last sickness his frequent questions were, Whether his disease was curable ? and when intimations Were given, that he might have ease, but no remedy, he used this expression, ‘ I shall be glad to find a hole to creep out of the world at j’ which are reported to have been his last sensible words; and his lying some days following in a silent stupefaction, did seem owing to his mind more than to his body",Chatsworth,US,6,United States,North America

"Finding that his wants grew more numerous than could be supplied by the industry of his aunt, he form¬ ed the commendable resolution of earning his own sub¬ sistence, and accordingly became a sort of assistant in the royal stables of Versailles. His ardent character, however, soon found this situation by far too degrading $ he already viewed it with abhorrence 5 and having ac¬ cidentally met with some part of the works of Rousseau, a spirit of independence instantly seized upon him.

He saw the necessity of a command of books, and as his pay was inadequate to the purchase of these, he determined to make up the deficiency by manual labour, with no species of which was he ever disgusted, while it put the means of intellectual improvement within his reach.

"Soon after this period appeared the celebrated pam¬ phlet of Sieyes respecting the Third Estate, and almost every Frenchman was ready to prove that he belonged to it. The guards, it is well known, took a decided part with the people 5 and on the 14th of July 1789? Hoche, at the head of his companions, was among the first who seized on the Bastile. The guards were formed into the I02d, 103d, and 104th regiments, into the last of which Hoche was admitted with the rank of second adjutant, when he had an opportunity of ma¬ nifesting his talents in a different channel. Improper hands having obtained the administration of the military hospital of the French guards, he minutely investigated the state of the accounts, which had been veiled with ambiguity for the purpose of deceiving. He amended the discipline of the army, and his active talents did not pass unrewarded. While the regiment was reviewed in the Elysian fields, Servan, the minister at war, was so delighted with the platoons of Hoche’s company, that he enquired who the young man was by whom it was conducted, and he bestowed on him some flattering com¬ pliments, and in four days after sent him the brevet of lieutenant in the regiment of Ronergue. Pie left Paris on the 24th of June 1792, in order to join his regi¬ ment, then in garrison at Thionville. General Leve- neur, who held the command in the absence of Va¬ lence, sent LieutenantPIoche with aregiment of hussars, to procure provisions for the troops which Miranda had ordered to lav siege to Maestricht. This he executed with universal applause •, and when the army of the Ardennes was ordered to recross the Meuse, Hoebe succeeded in removing the powder from the abbey of Merchen, in bringing away the military chest of the division, and conducting the sick in the hospital, wlien every thing appeared to be in the power of the enemy’s hussars.

"When Dumourier threw off the disguise at the camp of Maulde, arresting the deputies from the convention, General Leveneur entrusted to young Hoche the deli¬ cate charge of carrying the news to Paris.

"of Blisecastel, with the loss of 700 men killed upon the —y—- field. The duke of Brunswick retreated towards Kay- serlautern, at which place the whole of the Prussian columns formed a junction. General Hoche was well aware that his great object would be attained, if he could vanquish the enemy at this place, and therefore he began to scale the mountains, and when he reached the plain on the top, he found them deeply entrench¬ ed. In defiance of this advantageous position, he de¬ termined to give them battle, and as soon as the signal gun was fired, he advanced from the ranks, and tossing his hat in the air, he exclaimed “ Long live the repub¬ lic !” The attack on his part was bold, and the de¬ fence of the enemy was obstinate j about 40,000 were engaged on each side, but the able manner in which the duke of Brunswick had fortified his position, gave him evidently the advantage. After fighting for two days, Hoche obtained little or no advantage. The am¬ munition of the Prussians being exhausted, he next day determined to carry their entrenchments at the point of the bayonet 5 but being informed that they had ob¬ tained a supply during the night, he found it necessary to retreat. But he soon after relieved Landau, and ef¬ fected a junction with General Pichegru, being appoint¬ ed commander in chief of both armies","Brunswick, Brunswick",US,6,United States,North America
"The victorious Hoche afterwards made himself master of Germersheim; Worms and Spires opened their gates to receive him, and Fort \ anban was retaken. It was his determination to cross the Rhine at Strasburgh, or Offendorf, and venture into the heart of Germany with 25,000 men 5 to which movement Pichegru was un¬ friendly, and had the address to prevail with the repre¬ sentatives then present to refuse their sanction. Robe¬ spierre now regarded him with a jealous eye 5 all his plans were treated with unmerited indignity, and his arrest was resolved on. This, however, would have been a desperate attempt at the head of his victorious troops, and therefore he was offered the chief command of the army of Italy j but no sooner had he arrived at Nice than he was sent a prisoner to Paris, where he remain¬ ed confined for many months, almost entirely forgotten","Germersheim, Worms, Nice, Paris","DE,IT,FR,US",6,"Germany,Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"

"But as it was suspected that Hoche was too young to hold that important office, the council of five hundred sent a message to the executive power to receive infor¬ mation upon this point, during which General Hoche resigned, and set off for Charleville, where he had sta¬ tioned a body of troops for the purpose, it was believed, of marching to Paris. These orders being counter¬ manded, he set off for his head quarters. Although the royalist party was gaining ground in the legislature, and the general’s health rapidly on the decline, he de¬ termined to celebrate the memorable loth of August with great pomp and magnificence. He dispatched two confidential officers, Cherin and Angereau, to assist in the revolution which took place in a few days after their arrival in Paris, while he himself was labouring under a mortal distemper. He refused to comply with the advice of his physicians •, and when a messenger arrived with intelligence respecting the events of the 18th Fructidor, he rose from his bed with this excla¬ mation, “ the republic triumphs !” Soon after this he was appointed to command the army on the Rhine, on which he repaired immediately to Strasburg.

"The duke of Leeds has an original scene in the ‘‘ Beggar’s Opera,” painted by Hogarth. It is that in which Lucy and Polly are on their knees, before their respective fathers, to intercede for the life of the hero of the piece. All the figures are either known or supposed to be portraits. If we are not misinformed, the late Sir Thomas Robinson (perhaps better known by the name of Long Sir Thomas) is standing in one of the side-boxes. Macbeatb, unlike his spruce repre¬ sentative on our present stage, is a slouching bully; and Polly appears happily disencumbered of such a hoop as the daughter of Peachum within our younger memories has worn. Mr Walpole has a picture of a scene in the same piece, where Macheath is going to execution. In this also the likenesses of Walker, and Miss Fenton, afterwards duchess of Bolton (the first and original Macheath and Polly) are preserved. In the year 1726, when the affair of Mary Tofts, the rabbit-breedeV of Godaiming, engaged the public at¬ tention, a few of our principal surgeons subscribed their guinea a-pieee to Hogarth, for an engraving from a ludicrous sketch he had made on that verv po¬ pular subject. Ibis plate, among other portraits, contains that of St Andie, then anatomist to the royal household, and in high credit as a surgeon. In 1727, Hogarth agreed with Morris an upholsterer to furnish him with a design on canvas, representing the element of earth as a pattern for tapestry.

"Holbein said that he had forgot his title, but remem¬ bered his face so well, that he believed he could draw his likeness 5 which he did so perfectly, that the noble¬ man, it is said, was immediately known by it. The chancellor having now adorned his apartments with the productions of this great painter, resolved to introduce him to Henry VIII. For this purpose he invited that prince to an entertainment; having, before he came, hung up all Holbein’s pieces in the great hall, in the best order, and placed in the best light. The king, on his first entrance into this room, was so charmed with the sight, that he asked whether such an artist was now alive, and to be had for money ? Upon this, Sir Thomas presented Holbein to his majesty, who immediately took him into his service, and brought him into great esteem with the nobility and gentry, by which means he drew a vast number of portraits. But while he was here, there happened an affair which might have proved fatal to him, had he not been pro¬ tected by the king. On the report of this painter’s character, a lord of the first quality came to see him when he was drawing a figure after the life. Holbein sent to desire bis lordship to defer the honour of his visit to another day ; which the nobleman taking for an afiront, broke open the door, and very rudely went up stairs. Holbein hearing a noise, came out of his chamber ; and meeting the lord at his door, fell into a violent passion, and pushed him backwards from the top of the stairs to the bottom^ However, immediately reflecting on what he had done, he escaped from the tumult he had raised, and made the best of his way to the king. The nobleman, much hurt, though not so much as he pretended, was there soon after him ; and Holbein Upon opening his grievance, the king ordered Holbein || to ask his pardon. But this only irritated the noble-, Holdc1'- man the more, who would not be satisfied with less * "" than his life; upon which the king sternly replied, “ My lord, you have not now to do with Holbein but with me; whatever punishment you may contrive by way of revenge against him, shall certainly be in¬ flicted on yourself. Remember, pray, my lord, that I can whenever I please make seven lords of seven ploughmen, but I cannot make one Holbein of even seven lords.” Holbein died of the plague at his lodg¬ ings at Whitehall in 1554* “ It is amazing (says De Piles, that a man born in Switzerland, and who had never been in Italy, should have so good a .g&sYo, and so fine a genius for painting.” He painted alike in every manner; in fresco, in water-colours, in oil, and in miniature. His genius was sufficiently shown in the historical style, by two celebrated compositions which he painted in the hall of the Stillyard company.

It seems probable, however, that he was steward to Thomas Burdett, Esq. of Bomcote in Warwickshire, where he died about the year 1580. He has given name to a compilation of Chronicles of English history from the earliest times, the first edition of which was published at London in 1577, in two volumes folio, and the se¬ cond edition in three volumes, was printed about seven years after his death, brought down to 1586. Ibis work, according to the testimony of Holingshed him¬ self, was begun by the advice of Reginald Wolfe, prin¬ ter to Queen Elizabeth. Part of it was compiled by himself, but he received considerable assistance from William Harrison, John Hooker, Abraham Fleming, Francis Tbvnne, and some others. It was continued by John Stowe after the death of Holingshed. Some parts of the first edition were altered in the second and third, because they gave offence to Queen Elizabeth and the ministry, who laid many restrictions on the liberty of the press.

Its greatest extent from north to south including the island of Texel, is about 90 English miles j but from east to west its extent varies from 40 to 25. To defend it against the sea, dykes have been erected at an immense expence, and innumerable canals cut to drain it, as being naturally very low and marshy. Some parts of the province are very fruitful in corn j but the greater part consists of rich pastures, wherein are kept large herds of kine, which supply them with incredible quantities of butter and cheese. Of the latter, that of Edam, in North Holland, is highly esteemed. The many rivers and canals that intersect the province are of great advantage to its commerce, but contribute to render the air foggy and unwholesome. There is a Communication by water betwixt almost every town and village. Towards the middle also of the province are great numbers of turf-pits. The number of the inha¬ bitants in 1817 was 748,000. In point of cleanliness no country surpasses, and few come up to it, especially in North Holland, and that even in the villages. From the counts of Holland this province devolved, in 1436, to the dukes of Burgundy, and from them to the house of Austria, along with the other provinces. By the an¬ cient constitution of the country the states of Holland and West Friesland were composed of the nobility and deputies of the towns ; of the latter there were 18 that sent deputies to the assembly of the states, which was held at the Hague. The grand pensionary was a person of great dignity and weight in this assembly, and his office required extraordinary abilities. There were also two councils composed of deputies, one for South and another for North Holland, who had the cognizance of the revenue and military affairs. The whole province sent one deputy from among the noblesse to the states- general, who took precedence of all others, together with three or four more. There were two supreme courts of judicature for Holland and Zealand ; viz. the great council of Holland and Zealand, and the hof or court of Holland.

"They found three kinds of palm trees j but few esculent plants, though there are abundance of such as might gratify the curiosity of the botanist. A great variety of birds were met with, which have since been particu¬ larly described j but the number of quadrupeds bears but a very small proportion to that of tbe other ani¬ mals. The most remarkable insects seen at this time were the green ants (a), who build their nests upon trees in a very singular manner. 3 This country has now become an object of more Settlement consequence than formerly, by reason of the establish-of a Bntifli ment of a British colony in it $ where the criminals condemned to be transported are sent to pass their time lan(j of servitude. Before this plan was resolved on by govern¬ ment, another had been discussed, viz. that of employ¬ ing these criminals in workhouses j and Judge Black- stone, with Mr Eden and Mr Howard, had con¬ sidered of the best method of putting it in execution j but though this plan had been approved by parliament as early as 1779, some difficulties always occurred, which prevented its going forward j and at length on the 6th of December 1786, orders were issued by his majesty in council for making a settlement on New Holland, establishing a court of judicature in the colony, and other regulations necessary on the oc¬ casion. The whole received the complete sanction of legislature in the beginning of the year 1787. The squadron appointed for putting the design in execution began to assemble at the Mother Bank, the place of rendezvous, in the Isle of Wight, on the 16th of March 1787. It consisted of the Sirius frigate Cap¬ tain John Hunter, the Supply armed tender Lieute¬ nant (a) These little animals form their habitations, by bending down the leaves of trees, and glueing the ends of them together, so as to form a purse. Though these leaves are as broad as a man’s hand, they perform this feat by main strength, thousands of them being employed in holding down the leavesj while multitudes of others apply the glutinous matter. Captain Cook’s people ascertained themselves that this was the case, by some¬ times disturbing them at their work ; in which case the leaf always sprung up with an elasticity, which they could not have supposed that such minute insects were capable of overcoming. For this curiosity, however, they smarted pretty severely j for thousands of these little enemies instantly threw themselves upon the aggres¬ sors, and revenged themselves by their bites or stings for the interruption they had met with. These were little less painful at first than the sting of a bee j but the pain did not last above a minute. Another species of ants burrow themselves in the root of a plant which grows on the bark of trees like the misletoe, and which is com¬ monly as big as a large turnip. When this is cut, it appears intersected with innumerable winding passages all filled with these animals j notwithstanding which, the vegetation of the plant suffers no injury. These do not give pain by their stings, but produce an intolerable itching by crawling about on the skin. They are about the size of the small red ant in this country. Another sort, which do not molest in any manner, resemble the white ant of the East Indies. J hey construct nests three or four times as big as a man’s head on the branches of trees j the outsides being composed of some vegetable matter along with a glutinous substance. On breaking the outer crusts of these hives, innumerable cells appear swarming with inhabitants, in a great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with several other nests upon the same tree. They have also another house built on the ground, generally at the root of a tree *, formed like an irregular sided cone; some¬ times more than six feet high* and nearly as much in diameter. The outside of these is well-tempered clay about two inches thick: and within are the cells, which have no opening outward. One of these is their summer and the other their winter dwelling, communicating with each other by a large avenue leading to the ground, and by a subterraneous passage* The ground structures are proof against wet, which those on the branches are not,","Holland, March","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

These were to carry the convicts, with a detachment of marines in each proportioned to the nature of the service ; the largest where resistance was most expected, viz. in those which carried the greatest number of male con¬ victs. On the arrival of Governor Phillip at the sta¬ tion, he hoisted his flag on board the Sirius as commo¬ dore of the squadron; and the embarkation being com¬ pleted, he gave the signal to weigh anchor on the 13th of May at day-break. The number of convicts was 778, of whom 558 were men. They touched at the island of Tenerifle on the 3d of June, without meeting with any bad accident. Here they staid a week, in or¬ der to procure such refreshments as were necessary for preventing the disorders mostly to be dreaded in such a long and perilous voyage. In this they succeeded to their wish ; and were about to depart on the 9th of June, when it was discovered that one of the convicts had made his escape, having found means to cut away a boat and make off with it.

"On the 10th of June the fleet set sail from Santa Cruz in the island of Teneriffe, and on the 18th came in sight ot the Cape Verd islands, where they steered forStJago: but the want of a favourable wind and other circumstances prevented their getting in j so that as Governor Phillip did not choose to waste time, they did not touch land till they came to Rio Janeiro on the coast of Brazil. It may seem surprising, that a voyage to the eastward, which of itself may be accounted of sufficient length, should thus be wilfully made so much longer, by sailing twice across the Atlantic. The calms, however, so frequent on the coast of Africa, seem of themselves to be a sufficient inducement for na¬ vigators to preserve a westerly course $ and even the islands at which it is so necessary to touch, are not far distant from the American coast. The returning tracks of Captain Cook’s three voyages are all within a little space of the 45th degree of west longitude, which is even 10 degrees farther west than Cape St Roque ; and that course appears to have been taken voluntari¬ ly, without any extraordinary inducement",,"BR,US",6,"Brazil,United States","South America,North America"

Here they met with a very favourable reception, contrary to that which Captain Cook expe¬ rienced on a similar occasion. Provisions were so cheap, that though the allowance of meat was fixed by the go¬ vernor at 20 ounces per day, the men were victualled completely at 3|d. each, including rice, vegetables, and every other necessary. Wine was not at this time to be had except at an advanced price: but rum was laid New Hol- in, and such seeds and plants procured as were thought land, most likely to flourish in New South Wales $ particu- v—' larly coffee, indigo, cotton, and the cochineal fig.

It was soon found, however, absolutely neces- folk md-sary to make examples of some of the convicts at Port Jackson.

One who was the head of the gang was executed the same day : one of the rest was pardoned j the other four were repriev¬ ed, and afterwards exiled to a small island within the bay, where they were kept on bread and water. They had frequently robbed both the stores and other con¬ victs.

"The 4th of June being his majesty’s birth-day, was celebrated with as much festivity as circumstances would allow; and on this occasion it was first made public that the governor had given the name of Cumberland County to this part of the territory. The appointed boundaries were Carmarthen and Lansdown hills on the west, the northern parts of Broken Bay on the north, and the southern parts of Botany Bay on the south ; thus including these three principal bays, with Sydney Cove nearly in the centre. r The misfortunes which attended those convicts who A coink strayed to too great a distance from the settlement, exee'llfl1 were not sufficient to prevent some of them from ramb¬ ling into the woods, in hopes of subsisting themselves there and regaining their liberty. One of these, who had been guilty of a robbery, fled into the woods on the 5th of June, but was obliged to return half-starved on the 24th. He had found it impossible to subsist in the woods, and had met with very little relief from the natives. One of them gave him a fish, but made signs • for him to go away. According to his account, they themselves were in a very miserable situation ; and he pretended to have seen four of them apparently dying of hunger, who made signs to him for something to eat. He pretended also to have fallen in with a party who would have burnt him, and that he made his es¬ cape f»;om them with difficulty. He said also, that he had seen the remains of a human body lying on a fire ; and endeavoured to inculcate the idea of these savages eating human flesh when other provisions were scarce","Cumberland, Carmarthen, Sydney","US,GB,CA",6,"United States,United Kingdom,Canada","North America,Europe,North America"
"Thus a kind of uniformity will be preserved in the building, narrow streets prevented, and many inconve¬ niences avoided, which a rapid increase of inhabitants might otherwise occasion. It has likewise been an ob¬ ject of the governor’s attention to place the public buildings in such situations as will be eligible at all times, and particularly to give the store-houses and hos¬ pital sufficient space for future enlargement, should it be found necessary. The first huts erected in this place were composed only of the soft wood of the cabbage palm, in order to give immediate shelter, and which had the further inconvenience of being used quite green. The huts of the convicts were constructed only of upright posts wattled with slight twigs, and plaster¬ ed up with clay.

"Richmond hill, near which a fall prevented the boats from proceeding farther up, is the most southerly of a large range of hills which run to the northward, and 568 ] H O L probably join the mountains nearly parallel to the coast Ne from 50 to 60 miles inland. The soil of this hill is good, and it lies well for cultivation. There is a very extensive prospect from the top, the whole country a- round seeming a level covered with timber. There is a flat of six or seven miles between Richmond hill and a break in the mountains which separates Lansdown and Carmarthen kills ; in which flat the governor sup¬ poses that the Hawkesbury continues its course; though the river could not be seen on account of the timber with which the ground is everywhere covered where the soil is good. Six miles to the southward of Port Jackson is a small river } and 20 to the westward is one more considerable, which probably empties itself into the Hawkesbury. As far as this river was at that time explored, the breadth was computed at from 300 to 400 feet. It was named the Nepean, and, like the Hawkesbury, sometimes rises 30 feet above its level","Richmond, Richmond, Carmarthen, Jackson","ZA,GB,US",6,"South Africa,United Kingdom,United States","Africa,Europe,North America"
"A party who crossed the river attempted to reach the mountains, but found it impossible, probably for want of provisions.

At the time they turned back, they supposed themselves to be 12 miles from the foot of the mountains.

His views of abbeys, ' churches, ruins, &c. with his shells, muffs, and every species of still life, are admirable; his landscapes fre¬ quently have great merit; and his distant views of towns and cities are not only executed in a very accu¬ rate, but a very pleasing manner.” A somewhat colder character is given of them by Mr Gilpin in his Essay on Prints : “ Hollar gives us views of particular places, which he copies with great truth, unornamented as he found them. If we are satisfied with exact representa¬ tions, we have them nowhere better than in Hollar’s works; but if we expect pictures, we must seek them elsewhere. Hollar was an antiquarian and a draughts¬ man, but seems to have been little acquainted with the principles of painting. Stiffness is his character¬ istic, and a painful exactness void of taste. His larger views are mere plans. In some of his smaller, at the expence of infinite pains, something of an ef¬ fect is sometimes produced. But in general, we con¬ sider him as a repository of curiosities, a record of anti¬ quated dresses, abolished ceremonies, and edifices now in ruins.” HOLLOA, in the sea language, an exclamation of answer, to any person who calls to another to ask some question, or to give a particular order.

It contained, in more explicit terms than perhaps any other work of a religious theist then known in Scotland, the doctrine which has of late made so much noise under the appel¬ lation of philosophical necessity. The same thing had indeed been taught by Hobbes, by Collins, and by the celebrated David Hume, Esq. hut as those authors either were professed infidels, or were supposed to be such, it excited, as coming from them, no wonder, and provo¬ ked for a time very little indignation.

On the other hand, there were some, and those not totally illiterate, who, confounding necessity with predestination, complimented Mr Home on his ma¬ sterly defence of the established faith : and though be¬ tween these two schemes there is no sort of resemblance, except that the future happiness or misery of all men is, according to both, certainly foreknown and appointed bv God j yet we remember, that a professor in a dissent¬ ing academy so far mistook the one for the other, that he recommended to his pupils the Essays on Morality and Natural Religion, as containing a complete vindi¬ cation of the doctrine of Calvin. For this mistake he was dismissed from his office, and excluded from the communion of the sect to which he belonged. Lord Karnes, like many other great and good men, continued a Necessarian to the day of his death j but in a subse¬ quent edition of the Essays, he exhibited a remarkable proof of his candour and liberality of sentiment, by al¬ tering the expressions, which, contrary to his intention, bad given such general ofl’ence","Berkeley, Durham","US,IE",6,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"
"any species of scandal was exhibited in bis company, ' v""-1 he either remained silent, or endeavoured to give a dif¬ ferent turn to the conversation. As natural conse¬ quences of this amiable disposition, he never meddled with politics, even when parties ran to indecent lengths in this country ; and what is still more remarkable, he never wrote a sentence, notwithstanding his numerous publications, without a direct and a manifest intention to benefit his fellow creatures. In his temper he was naturally warm, though kind and aflectionate. In the friendships lie formed, he was ardent, zealous, and sincere. So far from being inclined to irreligion, as some ignorant bigots insinuated, few men possessed a more devout habit of thought. A constant sense of Deity, and a veneration for Providence, dwelt upon his mind. From this source arose that propensity which appears in all his writings, of investigating final causes, and tracing the wisdom of the Supreme Author of nature. But here we must stop. Lord Karnes, to the great regret of the public, died on the 27th day of December 1782. As he had no marked disease but the debility necessarily resulting from extreme old age, a few days before his death he went to the Court of Session, addressed all the judges separately, told them he was speedily to depart, and took a solemn and an affectionate farewell",Providence,US,6,United States,North America

"A man of Magnesia, whose name was Menalippus, went to settle at Cumse, where he married the daugh¬ ter of a citizen called Homyres, and had by her a daughter called Critheis. The father and mother dy¬ ing, the young woman was left under the tuition of Cleonax her father’s friend, and sufl'ering herself to be deluded, was got with child. The guardian, though his care had not prevented the misfortune, was how¬ ever willing to conceal it; and therefore sent Critheis to Smyrna, which was then building, 18 years after the founding of Cumae, and about 168 after the taking of Troy. Critheis being near her time, went one day to a festival which the town of Smyrna was celebra¬ ting on the banks of the river Meles; where her pains coming upon her, she was delivered of Homer, whom she called Melesigenes, because he was born on the banks H O M [ 581 ] H O M cr. banks of that river. Having nothing to maintain her, —' she was forced to spin, and a man of Smyrna called Phernias, who taught literature and music, having of¬ ten seen Critheis, who lodged near him, and being pleased with her housewifery, took her into his house to spin the wool he received from his scholars for their schooling. Here she behaved herself so modestly and discreetly, that Phemius married her ; and adopted her son, in whom he discovered a wonderful genius, and the best natural disposition in the world. After the death of Phemius and Critheis, Homer succeeded to his father-in-law’s fortune and school ; and was admi¬ red, not only by the inhabitants of Smyrna, but by strangers, who resorted from all parts to that place of trade. A shipmaster called Menles, who was a man of learning and a lover of poetry, was so taken with Ho¬ mer, that he persuaded him to leave his school, and to travel with him. Homer, who had then begun his poem of the Iliad, and thought it of great consequence to see the places he should have occasion to treat of, em¬ braced the opportunity. He embaiked with Mentes, and during their several voyages never failed carefully to note down all that he thought worth observing. He travelled into Egypt; from whence he brought into Greece the names of their gods, the chief ceremonies of their worship, and a more improved knowledge in the arts than what prevailed in his own country. He visited Africa and Spain ; in his return from whence he touched at Ithaca, where he was much troubled with a rheum falling upon his eyes. Mentes being in haste to take a turn to Leucadia his native country, left Homer well recommended to Mentor, one of the chief men of the island of Ithaca, who took all possible care of him. There Homer was informed of many things relating to Ulysses, which he afterwards made use of in composing his Odyssey. Mentes returning to Ithaca, found Homer cured. They embarked toge¬ ther j and after much time spent in visiting the coasts of Peloponnesus and the islands, they arrived at Colo¬ phon, where Homer was again troubled with the de- fluxion upon his eyes, which proved so violent, that he is said to have lost his sight. This misfortune made him resolve to return to Smyrna, where he finished his Iliad. Some time after, the ill posture of his affairs obliged him to go to Cumae, where he hoped to have found some relief. Here his poems were highly ap¬ plauded : but when he proposed to immortalize their town, if they would allow him a salary, he was answer¬ ed, that “ there would be no end of maintaining all the or blind men and hence got the name of Homer. He afterwards wandered through several places, and stopped at Chios, where he married, and composed his Odyssey. Some time after, having add¬ ed many verses to his poems in praise of the cities of Greece, especially of Athens and Argos, he went to Samos, wdiere he spent the winter, singing at the houses of the great men, with a train of boys after him. From Samos he went to lo, one of the Sporades, with a de¬ sign to continue his voyage to Athens ; but landing by the way at Chios, he fell sick, died, and was buried on the sea shore","Smyrna, Troy, Smyrna, Smyrna, Smyrna, Ho, Ithaca, Mentor, Ithaca, Ithaca, Smyrna, Athens, Athens","US,GR,EG,ES,GH",6,"United States,Greece,Egypt,Spain,Ghana","North America,Europe,Africa,Europe,Africa"
"Alcibiades gave a rhetorician a box on the ear for not having Homer’s writings in his school.

"The hymn to Ceres appears to be entire, excepting a few lines towards the close : and it is surely remarkable, that a Greek poem, attributed to Homer, which had been lost for ages, should be at length discovered in Muscovy, the rudest and most unclassical country in Europe. M. Matthtei, exulting in an acquisition so unexpected, and at the same time so valuable, commu¬ nicated it, with singular disinterestedness, to his learn¬ ed friend M. Ruhnkenius, with whose talents and ex¬ traordinary erudition he was well acquainted, that this gentleman might present it to the world without those delays which would probably have retarded the publica¬ tion of it at Moscow. He was rather induced to em¬ ploy M. Ruhnkenius in the publication of this curious and beautiful remnant of antiquity, because he knew that this gentleman had been particularly engaged in the study of the hymns of Homer, in order to give the public a complete edition of them. The hymn to Ce¬ res, and the fragment of the hymn to Bacchus, were printed in 1780 at Leyden, under the care of M. Ruhn- kenhis, who has added some very valuable notes and observations on the hymn to Ceres, which tend to illus¬ trate its beauties, and to throw a light on some of its obscurities. The learned editor observes, that nothing was more distant from his expectations than the disco¬ very of this hymn to Ceres. He knew indeed that a poem bearing that title, and ascribed to Homer, existed in the second century ; but as it had long been consi¬ dered as irretrievably lost, he had formed no hopes of ever seeing it rescued from the obscurity to which it had been consigned. He acknowledges, that he has many doubts with respect to the high and illustrious origin ascribed to this hymn : but as no positive external evi¬ dence can be produced to determine the point, he chooses to rest his argument on what appears to him the more certain ground of internal proof •, and observes, that though the poem be exquisitely beautiful, yet that it is evidently deficient in some of Homer’s more strik¬ ing and predominant characteristics. It wants his ener¬ gy and spirit; that vigour, that inspiration, which ani¬ mate and give an irresistible power, as well as an en¬ chanting beauty, to the poems of that sublime and ini¬ mitable bard. This opinion, as we have already seen, hath been given by other critics of all the hymns of 3 Homer. But though M. Ruhnkenius is not inclined to attribute to Homer the hymn to Ceres, he yet ac¬ knowledges, that the structure of its language is found- Hwmcidt","Ceres, Moscow, Ceres, Ceres, Ceres","ZA,US,GR",6,"South Africa,United States,Greece","Africa,North America,Europe"
"relations : and so also, according to Selden, stood the —~y——u law in the Jewish republic. The English law likewise justifies a woman killing one who attempts to ravish her: and so too the husband or lather may justify kill¬ ing a man, who attempts a rape upon his wife or daughter; hut not if he takes them in adultery by consent; lor the one is forcible and felonious, but not the other. And there is no doubt but the forcibly at¬ tempting a crime, of a still more detestable nature, may be equally resisted by the death of the unnatural aggressor. lor the one uniform principle that runs through our own, and all other laws, seems to be this : That where a crime, in itself capital, is endea¬ voured to he committed by force, it is lawful to repel that force by the death of the party attempting. But, we must not carry this doctrine to the same visionary length that Mr Locke does ; who holds, “ that ail manner of force without right upon a man’s person, puts him in a state of war with the aggressor; and, of consequence, that, being in such a state of war, he may lawfully kill him that puts him under this unnatu¬ ral restraint.” However just this conclusion may be in a state of uncivilized nature, yet the law of Eng¬ land, like that of every other well-regulated communi¬ ty, is too tender of the public peace, too careful of the lives of the subjects, to adopt so contentious a system ; nor will sufier with impunity any crime prevented by death, unless the same, if committed, would also be punished by death",Selden,US,6,United States,North America
"But to proceed. A tilt or tournament, the martial diversion of our ancestors, was however an unlawful act j and so are boxing and sword-playing, the succeed¬ ing amusement of their posterity : and therefore, if a knight in the former case, or a gladiator in the latter, be killed, such killing is felony of manslaughter. But if the king command or permit such diversion, it is said to be only misadventure ; for then the act is lawful : In like manner as, by the laws both of Athens and Rome, he who killed another in the pancratium, or public games, authorised or permitted by the state, was not held to be guilty of homicide. Likewise to whip another’s horse, whereby he runs over a child and kills him, is held to be accidental in the rider, for he has done nothing unlawful 5 but manslaughter in the person who whipped him, for the act was a trespass, and at best a piece of idleness, of inevitably dangerous conse¬ quence. And in general, if death ensues in consequence of an idle, dangerous, and unlawful sport, as shooting or casting stones in a town, or the barbarous diversion of cock-throwing j in these and similar cases, the slayer is guilty of manslaughter, and not misadventure only ; for these are unlawful acts","Athens, Rome",US,6,United States,North America

"But honour is more particularly applied to two differ¬ ent kinds of virtue} bravery in men, and chastity in women.—Virtue and Honour were deified among the ancient Greeks and Romans, and had a joint temple 5 consecrated to them at Rome } but afterwards each of Honour, them had separate temples, which were so placed that no one could enter the temple of Honour without passing through that ot Virtue; by which the Romans were con¬ tinually put in mind, that virtue is the only direct path to true glory.

"His pursuers soon lost sight of him, for he had unper* ceived thrown himself over a garden wall. The owner, a Moor, happening to be in his garden, was addressed by the Spaniard on his knees, who acquainted him with his case, and implored concealment. “ Eat this,” said the Moor (giving him half a peach), “ you now know that you may confide in my protection.” He then locked him up in his garden apartment, telling him as soon as it was night he would provide for his escape to a place of greater safety. The Moor then went into his house, where he had but just seated himself, when a great crowd, with loud lamentations, came to his gate, bringing the corpse of his son, who had just been killed by a Spaniard. When the first shock of surprise was a little over, he learnt from the descrip¬ tion given, that the fatal deed was done by the very person then in his power. He mentioned this to no one ; but as soon as it was dark retired to his garden, as if to grieve alone, giving orders that none should follow him. Then accosting the Spaniard, he said, “ Christian, the person you have killed is my son ; his body is now in my house. You ought to softer ; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my faith, which must not be broken.” He then led the astonished Spaniard to his stables, mounted him on one of his fleetest horses, and said, “ Fly far while the night can cover you ; you will be safe in the morn¬ ing. You are indeed guilty of my son’s blood : but God is just and good ; and I thank him I am innocent of yours, and that my faith given is preserved.” This point of honour is most religiously observed by the Arabs and Saracens, from whom it was adopted by the Moors of Africa, and by them wms brought into Spain. The following instance of Spanish honour may still dwell in the memory of many living, and de¬ serves to be handed down to the latest posterity. In the year 1746, when we were in hot war with Spain, the Elizabeth of London, Captain William Edwards, co¬ ming through the gulf from Jamaica, richly laden, met with a most violent storm, in which the ship sprung a leak, that obliged them, for the saving of their lives, to run into the Havannah, a Spanish port.

"HOOKE, Robert, a very eminent English mathe-' matician and philosopher, was the son of Mr John Hooke minister of Freshwater, in the isle of Wight, where he was born in 1635. He very early discover¬ ed a genius for mechanics, by making curious toys with great art and dexterity. He was educated under Dr Bushby in Westminster school; where he not only acquired a competent share of Greek and Latin, toge- ther with an insight into Hebrew and some other Ori¬ ental languages, but also made himself master of a con¬ siderable part of Euclid’s elements. About the year 1653, he went to Christ-church in Oxford, and in 1655 was introduced to the Philosophical Society there; where, discovering his mechanical genius, he was first employed to assist Dr Willis in his operations in che¬ mistry, and afterwards recommended to the honourable Robert Boyle, whom he served several years in the same capacity. He was also instructed in astronomy about this time by Dr Seth Ward, Savilian professor of that science; and from henceforward distinguished himself by many noble inventions and improvements of the mechanic kind. He invented several astronomi¬ cal instruments, for making observations both at sea and land ; and was particularly serviceable to Mr Boyle in completing the invention of the air-pump","Westminster, Euclid, Oxford","US,UK,GR",6,"United States,N/A,Greece","North America,N/A,Europe"

In 1666 lie produced to the Royal Society a model for rebuilding the city of London destroyed by fire, with which the society was well pleased ; but although the lord mayor and aldermen preferred it to that of the city surveyor, it was not carried into execution. It is said, by one part of this mo¬ del of Mr Hooke’s, it was designed to have all the chief streets, as from Leaden-hall to Newgate, and the like, to lie in exact straight lines, and all the other cross streets turning out of them at right angles, with all the churches, public buildings, markets, &c. in proper and convenient places.

"1658, The double barrelled air-pump.—The co¬ nical pendulum.—His first emoloyment of the coni¬ cal pendulum was no less ingenious and scientific than it was original. He employed it to represent the mutual gravitation of the planets; a fact which he had most systematically announced. He had shewn, that a force, perfectly analogous to gravity on this earth, operated on the surface of the moon and of Ju¬ piter. Considering the numerous round pits on the surface of the moon, surrounded with a sort of wall, and having a little eminence in the middle, as the pro¬ duction of volcanoes, he inferred, that the ejected matter fell back again to the moon, as such matter falls back again to the earth. He saw Jupiter surrounded with an atmosphere, which accompanied him; and therefore pres¬ sed on him, as our air presses on the earth:—He inferred, that it was the same kind of power that maintained the sun and other planets in a round form. He inferred a force to the sun from the circulation round him, and he called it a gravitation; and said that it was not the earth which described the ellipse, but the centre of gra¬ vity of the earth and moon. He therefore made a co¬ nical pendulum, whose, tendency to a vertical position represented the gravitation to the sun, and which was projected at right angles to the vertical plane ; and shewed experimentally, how the different proportions of the projectile and centripetal tendencies produced vari¬ ous degrees of eccentricity in the orbit. He then add¬ ed another pendulum, describing a cone round the first, while this described a cone round the vertical line, in order to see what point between them described the ellipse. The results of the experiment were intricate and unsatisfactory ; but the thought was ingenious",Jupiter,US,6,United States,North America

A certain mauvmse ' honte hindered me at that time from giving a direct answer. The truth is, my lord, I cannot be said at present to be in any form of life, but rather to live extempore. The late epidemical distemper seized me, I endeavoured to be rich, imagined for a while that I was, and am in some measure happy to find myself at this instant but just worth nothing. If your lordship, or any of your numerous friends, have need of a ser¬ vant with the bare qualifications of being able to read and write, and to be honest, I shall gladly undertake any employments your lordship shall not think me unworthy of. I have been taught, my lord, that nei¬ ther a man’s natural pride, nor his self-love, is unequal judge of what is fit for him ; and I shall endeavour to remember, that it is not the short part we act, but the manner of our performance, which gains or loses us the applause of Him who is finally to decide of all human actions. My lord, I am just now employed in trans¬ lating from the French, a History of the Life of the late Archbishop of Cambray ; and I was thinking to beg the honour of your lordship’s name to protect a work which will have so much need of it. The ori¬ ginal is not yet published. ’Tis written by the author of the Discourse upon F.pic Poetry, in the new edi¬ tion of Telemaque. As there are some passages in the book of a particular nature, I dare not solicit your lordship to grant me the favour I have mentioned, till yon first have perused it. The whole is short, aud pretty fairly transcribed. If your lordship could find a spare hour to look it over, I would wait upon your lordship with it, as it may possibly be no unpleasing entertainment. I should humbly ask your lordship s pardon for so long an address in a season of so much business.

But, (he pro¬ ceeds), when I can write under my sign, that Mr Pope has been here, and was content, who will ques¬ tion the goodness of the house ?” The volume is in¬ troduced by “ Remarks on the History of the Seven Roman Kings, occasioned by Sir Isaac Newton’s ob¬ jections to the supposed 244 years duration of the royal state of Rome.” His nervous pen was next em¬ ployed in digesting ** An Account of the conduct of the Dowager-duchess of Marlborough, from her first coming to court to the year 1710, in a Letter from herself to Lord in *1742,” 8vo.

Mr Hooke was recommended by him for that purpose. He accordingly waited upon the duchess, while she was still in be , oppressed by the infirmities of age. But, knowing who he was, she immediately got herself lifted up, and continued speak¬ ing during six hours. She delivered to him, without any notes, her account in the most lively as well as the most connected manner. As she was not tired her¬ self, she would have continued longer the business of this first sitting, had not she perceived that Mr Hooke was quite exhausted, and wanted refreshment as well as rest. So eager was she for the completion of the work, that she insisted upon Mr Hooke’s not leaving her house till he had finished it. This was done in a short time } and her Grace was so well pleased with the performance, that she complimented the author with a present of 5000I. a sum which far exceeded his expectations. As soon as he was free, and permitted to quit the house of his benefactress, he hastened to the earl, to thank him for his favour, and communi¬ cated to him his good fortune. The perturbation of mind he was under, occasioned by the strong sense of his obligation, plainly appeared in his stammering out his acknowledgments : and he, who had succeeded so well as the interpreter of her Grace’s sentiments, could scarcely utter his own.” The second volume of his Roman History appeared in 1745 > when Mr Hooke embraced the fair occasion of congratulating his wor¬ thy friend the earl of Marchmont, on “ that true glory, the consenting praise of the honest and the wise,” which his lordship had so early acquired, lo the second volume Mr Hooke added “ The Capitoline Marbles, or Consular Calenders, an ancient Monument accidentally discovered at Rome in the year 1545, du¬ ring the Pontificate of Paul III.” In 1758 Mr Hooke published Observations on, I.

In October, in the same year, he was lor some trivial misdemeanor expelled the college, but was immediately restored. In 1581 he took orders j and, being appointed to preach at St Paul’s cross, he came to London, where he was unfortunately drawn into a marriage with Joan Churchman, the termagant daugh¬ ter of his hostess. Having thus lost his fellowship, he continued in the utmost distress till the year 15^4* when he was presented by John Cheny, Esq. to the rectory of Drayton-Beaucham in Buckinghamshire. In this retirement he was visited by Mr Edwin Sandys, and Mr George Cranmer, his former pupils. They found him, with a Horace in his hand, tending some sheep in the common field, his servant having been or¬ dered home by his sweet Xantippe. They attended him to his house j but were soon deprived of his company by an order, from his wife Joan, for him to come and rock the cradle. Mr Sandys’s representation to his father, of his tutor’s situation, procured him the mas¬ tership of the Temple. In this situation he met with considerable molestation from one Travers, lec¬ turer of the Temple, and a bigotted Puritan, who in the afternoon endeavoured to confute the doctrine de¬ livered in the morning. From this disagreeable situa¬ tion he solicited Archbishop Whitgift to remove him to some country retirement, where he might prosecute his studies in tranquillity.

In the reign of Edward II. they complained to parlia¬ ment, that by foreigners buying up the horns in Eng¬ land, they were in danger of being ruined, and this business lost to the nation. For this reason was made the statute 6 Edw. IV. by which the sale of horns to foreigners (except such as the said horners refused) was prohibited ; and the wardens had power granted them to search all the markets in London, and twenty-four miles round, and to inspect Sturbridge and Ely fairs, to prevent such practices, and to purchase horns at sta¬ ted prices. But on plausible pretences this law was re¬ pealed in the reign of James I. and thereupon the old evil revived. The horners again applied to parlia¬ ment, and King Edward’s statute was renewed (except¬ ing as to the inspection of the fairs), and still remains in force. The importation of unwrought horns into this country is also prohibited. In 1750, there were exported to Holland 514,500 lantern leaves, besides powder flasks. There was formerly a duty of 20 shil¬ lings a thousand, under which in 1682 were exported 76,650 ; but in the reign of George I. this duty was taken off, and these and all other manufactures made of horns may be exported free.

"The laws of the Salvi ordained that the moveables of an inhospitable person should be confiscated, and his house burnt. They were even so solicitous for the en¬ tertainment of strangers, that they permitted the land¬ lord to steal for the support of his guest.” The hospitality of our British ancestors, particularly of the great and opulent barons, hath been much ad¬ mired, H O S [ 629 ] H O S » italiiy, mired, and considered as a certain proof of the noble- Z y—~J ness and generosity of their spirits. The fact is well attested. The castles of the powerful barons were ca¬ pacious palaces, daily crowded with their numerous retainers, who were always welcome to their plentiful tables. They had their privy counsellors, their trea¬ surers, marshals, constables, stewards, secretaries, chap¬ lains, heralds, pursuivants, pages, henshmen or guards, trumpeters, minstrels, and in a word all the officers of a royal court. The etiquette of their families was an exact copy of that of the royal household ; and some of them lived in a degree of pomp and splendour little inferior to that of the greatest kings. Richard Ne¬ ville, earl of Warwick, we are told, “ was ever had in great favour of the commons of the land, because of the exceeding household which he daily kept in all countries wherever he sojourned or lay : and when he came to London, he held such an house, that six oxen were eaten at a breakfast; and every tavern was full of his meat.” The earls of Douglas in Scotland, before the fall of that great family, rivalled or rather exceed¬ ed their sovereigns in pomp and profuse hospitality. But to this manner ot living it is highly probable these great chieftains were prompted by a desire of increa¬ sing the number and attachment of their retainers, on which, in those turbulent times, their dignity, and even their safety, depended, as much as to the innate generosity of their tempers. Those retainers did not constantly reside in the lamilies of their lords ; but they wore their liveries and badges, frequently feasted in their halls, swelled their retinues on all great solem¬ nities, attended them in their journeys, and followed them into the field of battle.

"] HOT The deputy-governor has the direction of the com¬ pany’s whole commerce here, and signs all orders to the different departments under him, as well as the governor to others. He and the fiscal have the rank of upper koopman. The fiscal is at the head of the po¬ lice, and sees the penal laws put in execution : his in¬ come consists of fines, and of the duties laid on cer¬ tain articles of commerce ; but if he be strict in exact¬ ing them, he is universally detested. The sound policy oi the Dutch has likewise found it necessary to place the fiscal as a check, to overawe the other officers of the company, that they may not counteract the inte¬ rests of their masters, or infringe the laws of the mo¬ ther-country. He is, to that end, commonly well versed in juridical affairs, and depends solely upon the mother-country. The major (at present Mr Von Prehn, who received us with great politeness) has the rank of koopman or merchant: this circumstance sur¬ prises a stranger, who, in all other European states, is used to see military honours confer distinction and pre¬ cedence; and appears still more singular to one who knows the contrast in this particular between Holland and Russia, where the idea of military rank is annexed to every, place, even that of a professor at the univer¬ sity. The number of regular soldiers at this colony amounts to about 700, of which 400 form the gar¬ rison of the fort, near the Cape-town. The inhabi¬ tants capable of bearing arms form a militia of 4000 men, of whom a considerable part may he assembled in a few hours, by means of signals made from alarm- places in different parts of the country. We may from hence make some estimate of the number of white people in this colony, which is at present so extensive, that the distant settlements are above a month’s jour¬ ney from the Cape : but these remote parts lie some¬ times more than a day’s journey from each other, are surrounded by various nations of Hottentots, and too frequently feel the want of protection from their own government at that distance. The slaves in this colony are at least in the proportion of five or more to one white person. The principal inhabitants at the Cape have sometimes from 20 to 30 slaves, who are in ge¬ neral treated with great lenity, and sometimes become great favourites with their masters, who give them ver y good clothing, but oblige them to wear neither shoes nor stockings, reserving these articles to themselves",Holland,"RU,US,NL",6,"Russian Federation,United States,Netherlands","Europe,North America,Europe"

He discovered an invincible propensity to learning at a very early period, and acquired the knowledge of languages with astonishing facility. The trustees of the schools had their attention attracted towards Hottinger by his amazing progress in the knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, whom they determined to send to foreign universities at the public expence. In 1638 he studied for a short time at Geneva under the cele¬ brated Spanheim, and went afterwards to France. He next visited Holland and Flanders, and became a stu¬ dent HOT [ 639 ] H O U }k nger. <3ent in the university of Groningen, where he attended ' the theological lectures of the renowned Francis Gomar, and Professor Alting, and studied the Arabic language tinder Professor Pasor. Being anxious, however, to en¬ joy still more advantages than this situation afforded, he went to Leyden, where he became tutor to the chil¬ dren of Professor Golius, whose knowledge of oriental languages was at that time unrivalled. By his instruc¬ tions and those of a Turk then at Leyden, Hottinger’s knowledge of the Arabic became very extensive, and Golius allowed him to copy many of the Arabic ma¬ nuscripts which he had in his possession. In 1641 he was chosen chaplain to the embassy of the states-general to Constantinople j but the magistrates of Zurich would not allow him to accept of it, resolving that his talents should be exerted for the glory and benefit of their own public schools. They permitted him to visit Eng¬ land prior to his return home, where he contracted ha¬ bits of intimacy with some of the most distinguished li¬ terary characters. As soon as he returned to Zurich, he was appointed professor of church-history, when no more than 22 years of age ; and when 23, he was cho¬ sen professor of catechetical divinity and oriental lan¬ guages. About this period he married, and began his career as an author, in which he persevered for twenty years, with the most astonishing industry. In 1653 he was appointed professor of rhetoric, and professor ex¬ traordinary of the divinity of the Old Testament, and controversial theology","Geneva, Holland, Groningen","US,FR,NL,GR,TR",6,"United States,France,Netherlands,Greece,Turkey","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia"
"So justly celebrated about this time was Hottinger as a man of uncommon erudition, that his aid was earnest¬ ly requested by the elector palatine, to restore the fame of the university of Heidelberg. The magistrates of Zurich consented to lend him for three years. At Hei¬ delberg he was made professor of divinity, principal, ecclesiastical counsellor, and rector. He wrote in fa¬ vour of the re-union of Lutherans and Calvinists ; but he had no better success than all his predecessors in the same attempt. He continued at Heidelberg, by per¬ mission of the magistrates of Zurich, till 1661. On his return home, he was chosen president of the com¬ missioners who were appointed to revise the German translation of the Bible. He was requested to accept of professorships from the magistrates of Deventer, the landgrave of Hesse, and the magistrates of Amsterdam and Bremen j but the love of his country made him re¬ fect the whole. He was offered the divinity chair at Leyden in 1667, but the magistrates would not part with him.

Wood says, from tradition, that he was some time a student at Cardinal College, Oxford. In his youth he became enamoured of the Fair Geraldine, whom his sonnets have immortalized. In 1532, Howard with his companion Richmond was at Paris, where they continued some time.

"His travels and exertions, however, were not yet at an end.

Not gaining all the satisfaction here which he wished for, he proceeded to Smyrna and Constan¬ tinople, where that most dreadful of human distempers actually prevailed, “ pleasing himself (as he said) with the idea of not only learning, but of being able to communicate somewhat to the inhabitants of those di¬ stant regions.” In the execution of this design, though he was so much exposed to danger, and actually caught the plague, “ that merciful Providence (as he him¬ self piously remarks) which had hitherto preserved him, was pleased to extend his protection to him in this journey also, and to bring him home once more in safety.” In his return he revisited the chief pri¬ sons and hospitals in the countries through which he passed ; and afterwards went again to Scotland, and then to Ireland, where he proposed a new and very important object; namely, to inspect the Protestant Charter Schools, in some of which he had before ob¬ served shameful abuses, which he had reported to a committee of the Irish House of Commons. In this more extensive tour, he took a particular account of what he observed amiss in the conduct of this noble charity, with a view to a reformation, and not without considerable success.

I am not insensible (says he) of the dangers that must attend such a journey. Trusting, however, in the protection of that kind Providence which has hi¬ therto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of unerring wisdom. Should it please God to cut off my life in the prosecution of this design, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to rashness or enthusiasm, but to a serious deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty, and to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrower circle of a retired life.” Accordingly, to the great concern of his friends, h« set out in summer 1789 on this hazardous enterprixe •, the principal object of which was to administer a me¬ dicine in high repute at home, in maligaant fever* under a strong persuasion that it would be equally effi-p*'v‘,er cacious in the plague. In this second tour in the east, “ it did please God to cut off his life :” for, ha¬ ving spent some time at Cherson, a new settlement of the empress of Russia, on the mouth of the Dnieper or Borysthenes, toward the northern extremity of the Black sea, near Oczakow, he caught, in visiting the Russian hospital of that place, or as some say a young lady who was ill of the same complaint, a malignant fever, which carried him off on the 20th of January, after an illness of about twelve days : and after ha¬ ving been kept, according to his express directions to his servant, five days, he was buried, by his own de¬ sire, in the garden of a villa in the neighbourhood, be¬ longing to a French gentleman from whom he bad received [ 650 ] *; M ]fi (in in *7 HOW [ 651 ] HOW imd received great civilities, by his faithful servant who had |j attended him on his former journeyings, and whom he we. expressly enjoined not to return home till five weeks from his death.

From his early attachment to the life of a mariner, he quit¬ ted the school of Eton at the age of 14, and went on board the Severn, the honourable Captain Legge be¬ ing commander, destined for the South seas under Commodore Anson. Mr Howe next appeared in the Burford, Captain Lushington commander, who being killed in an expedition against the Caraccas, Commo¬ dore Knowles made Mr Howe an acting lieutenant. At the age of 20 he was promoted to the rank of command¬ er in the Baltimore sloop of war, and he joined a squa¬ dron at that time cruising off the coast of Scotland, where he met with an opportunity of displaying his undaunted courage and intrepidity, by engaging and beating off two French frigates of 30 guns each, by the assistance of another armed ship, notwithstanding he was severely wounded in the head during the action","Severn, Baltimore","US,UK,FR",6,"United States,N/A,France","North America,N/A,Europe"
"This service was immediately and very justly reward¬ ed with the rank of post-captain. He was soon after appointed to the rank of captain on board Commodore Knowles’s own ship of 80 guns, with which he return¬ ed to England in the year 1748. When hostilities again commenced, he commanded the Dunkirk of 60 guns, in North America ; which ship constituted part of the squadron under Admiral Boscawen, and with which he captured a French man of war of superior metal off the coast of Newfoundland ; viz. the Alcide of 64 guns. In order to annoy the coast of France, he received, in the year 1758, the command of a small squadron, with which he effected the destruction, at St Malo, of a number of magazines and ships. When he served on board the Essex, Prince Edward, afterwards duke of York, sailed with him, at which time he power¬ fully contributed to the reduction of the town of Cher¬ bourg. In 1758 his elder brother fell in North Ame¬ rica in the service of his king and country, on which event the young commodore succeeded to the family title and estate. In the following year he participated of the honourable victory gained by Sir Edward Hawke over the French fleet under Admiral Conflans. He afterwards served in the Channel, and was captain of the Amelia, the ship of admiral the duke of York. On the restoration of peace, he was nominated one of the lords of the admiralty, and some time afterwards, trea¬ surer of the navy. He rvasinthe year 1770, raised to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and chosen com¬ mander-in-chief on the Mediterranean station. In 1775, he rose to the station of rear-admiral of the blue ; in consequence of which rapid promotions, Lord Hawke paid him the following compliment in the house of peers: “ I advised his majesty to make the promo¬ tion. I have tried my Lord Howe on important occa¬ sions ; he never asked me how he was to execute any service, but always went and performed it”","Essex, Prince Edward, York, York","FR,US,CA",6,"France,United States,Canada","Europe,North America,North America"
"There are many large pigeons, and the white birds found in Norfolk island were also met with in this place. The bill of this bird is red, and very strong, thick, and sharp pointed. Great numbers of fine turtle frequent this island in summer, but go to the northward in winter. These, it was imagined, would prove of great service to the colony at Port Jackson j but, from some cause or other, it appears they have hi¬ therto been disappointed. Plenty of fish were caught by a hook and line. At the distance of about four leagues from Lord Howe’s island is a very remarkable and high rock, to which the name of Ball’s Pyramid has been given. This island may be approached with¬ out danger j but about four miles from the south-west part of the pyramid there is a very dangerous rock, which shows itself above the surface of the water, and appears not to be larger than a boat. The southern part of the island is lined with a sandy beach, which is guarded against the sea by a reef of coral rocks, at the distance of half a mile from the beach, through which there are several small openings for boats j but there is nowhere a greater depth of water within the reef than four feet. By the account of Mr Watts, who visited this island in his return from Port Jackson, the isthmus which joins the two parts has evidently been overflow¬ ed, and the island disjoined, as in the very centre the men saw large beds of coral rocks and great quantities of shells 5 and on the east, which seems in general to be the weather-side, the sea has thrown up a bank of sand from 25 to 30 feet high, which serves as a bar¬ rier against future inundations.

"Hoy, one of the Orkney islands, which lie off the north coast of Scotland, is situated between the island of Pomona and the north coast of Caithness, and is se¬ parated from the small island of Graemsay by a sound of a mile broad. The whole island is nearly occupied by three large hills, of which that to the north-east rises from a broad base to the height of 1200 feet. Some veins of lead and iron have been discovered in this island. Birch trees of considerable size seem to have been produced on it in former times. But at present its vegetable productions, excepting what are fit for sheep pasture, are extremely limited. A few hardy al¬ pine plants and stunted shrubs include the whole. The number of inhabitants does not exceed 520. The Dwarfie stone is the only monument of antiquity in the island. This is a large mass of sand-stone 3 2 feet long, 18 broad, and y-J feet thick above the surface. It is hollowed within, and divided into three apartments, one of which, called the dwarf’s bed, is five feet eight long, by two feet broad. It lias probably been the re¬ treat of a hermit.

"Hudson's Bay, a large bay of North America, ly¬ ing between 51 and 69 degrees of latitude, discovered in 1610, by Henry Hudson. This intrepid mariner, in searching after a nor: h-west passage to the South seas, discovered three straits, through which he hoped to find out a new way to Asia by America. He had made two voyages before on the same adventure; the first in 1607, and the second in 1608. In his third and last, 16x0, he entered the straits that lead into this new mediterranean, the bay known by his name ; coasted a great part of it; and penetrated to eighty degree* and a half into the heart of the frozen zone. His ardour for the discovery not being abated by the diffi¬ culties he struggled with in this empire of winter, and world of frost and snow, he staid here until the ensu¬ ing spring, and prepared in the beginning of 1611 to pursue his discoveries •, but his crew, who suffered equal hardships, without the same spirit to support them, mutinied, seized upon him and seven of those who were most faithful to him, and committed them to the fury of the icy seas in an open boat. Hudson and his companions were either swallowed up by the waves, or gaining the inhospitable coast were destroyed by the savages j but the ship and the rest of the men returned home.

In 1746 Captain Ellis wintered as far north as 57 degrees and a half, and Captain Christopher attempted farther discoveries in 1761. But besides these and the late voyages, which satisfy us that we must not look for a passage on this side of the latitude 67 degrees north, we are indebted to the Hudson’s Bay company for a journey by land 5 which throws much additional light on this matter, by affording what may be called demonstration, how much farther north, at least in seme parts of their voyage, ships must go, before they can pass from one side of America to the other. The northern Indians, who come down to the company’s factories to trade, had brought to the knowledge of our people a river, which, on account of much copper being found near it, had obtained the name of the Copper-mine river. The company being desirous of examining into this matter with precision, directed Mr Hearne, a young gentle¬ man in their service, and who having been brought up for the navy and served in it the war before last, was extremely well qualified for the purpose, to pro¬ ceed over land under the convoy of those Indians, for that river, which he had orders to survey if possible quite down to its exit into the sea *, to make observa¬ tions for fixing the latitudes and longitudes •, and to bring home maps and drawings both of it and the countries through which he should pass. Accordingly Mr Ilea rne set out from Prince of Wales’s fort, on Churchill river, latitude 58° 47E north, and longi¬ tude 940 yp west from Greenwich, on the 7th of December 1770. On the 13th of June be reached the Copper-mine river, and found it all the way, even to its exit into the sea, encumbered with shoals and falls, and emptying itself into it over a dry flat of the shore, the tide being then out, which seemed by the edges of the ice to rise about 12 or 14 feet. This rise, on account of the falls, will carry it but a very small way within the river’s mouth, so that the water in it had not the least brackish taste. Mr Hearne was nevertheless sure of the place it emptied itself into be¬ ing the sea, or a branch of it, by the quantity of whale¬ bone and seal skins which the Esquimaux had at their tents, and also by the number of seals which he saw upon the ice. The sea at the river’s mouth was full of islands and shoals as far as he could see by the assist¬ ance of a pocket telescope \ and the ice was not yet (July 17th) broken up, but thawed away only for about three quarters of a mile from the shore, and for a little way round the islands and shoals which lay off the river’s mouth. But he had the most extensive view of the sea when he was about eight miles up the river ; from winch station the extreme parts of it bore north-west by west and north-east. By the time Mr Hearne had finished his survey of the river, which was about one o’clock in the morning on the 18th, there came on a very thick fog and drizzling rain ; and as he had found the river and sea in every respect unlikely to be of any utility, be thought it unnecessary to wait for fair wea¬ ther to determine the latitude more exactly by observa¬ tion j but by the extraordinary care he took in observ¬ ing the courses and distances, walking from Congeca- thawhachaga, where he had two very good observa¬ tions, he thinks the latitude may be depended on with- HUD It appears fiom the map which Mr Hearne constructed of this singular journey, that the mouth ol the Copper-mine river lies in latitude 720 north, and longitude 250 west from Churchill river; that is, about 1190 west of Greenwich. Mr Hearne’s jour¬ ney back from the Copper-mine river to Churchill last¬ ed till June 30th 1772 : so that he was absent almost a year and seven months. The unparalleled hardships he suffered, and the essential service he performed, met with a suitable reward from his masters, and he xvas made, governor of Prince of Wales’s fort on Churchill river. The recent voyage of Captain Parry (1820) has shown that a sea does exist towards the parts where Hearne observed it, but whether this sea communicates directly with Hudson’s bay remains to be discovered","Hudson, Bay, Hudson","US,PH",6,"United States,Philippines","North America,Asia"

The depth of water in the middle of the bay is a hundred and forty fathoms. From Cape Churchill to the south end of the bay are regular soundings ; near the shore shallow, with muddy or sandy bottom. To the north of Churchill the soundings are irregular, the bottom rocky, and in some parts the rocks appear above the surface at low water.

"HUME, David, Esq. a celebrated philosopher and historian, was born in the south part of Scotland on the 26th of April O. S. in the year 1711. Being the younger son of a country gentleman of good family, but no great fortune, his patrimony was of consequence insufficient to support him. For this reason he was des¬ tined for the bar, and passed through his academical courses in the university of Edinburgh ; but being more inclined to studies of a different nature, he never put on „ , , the gown, nor even took the introductory steps for that short continuance ; and their sufferings, mitigated by purpose. The writings of Locke and Berkeley had di- the famous edict of Nantes, granted to them in 1598 reeled the attention of the generality of learned men to¬ wards HUM E 659 ] HUM I die. wards metaphysics j and Mr Hume having early ap- ^ plied himself to studies of this kind, published in 1739 the two first volumes of his Treatise of Human Nature, and the third the following year. He had the mortifi¬ cation, however, to find his book generally decried j and to perceive, that the taste for systematic writing was now on the decline. He therefore divided this trea¬ tise into separate Essays and Dissertations, which he af¬ terwards published at different times with alterations and improvements","David, Edinburgh, Berkeley, Nantes","PA,GB,US,FR",6,"Panama,United Kingdom,United States,France","North America,Europe,North America,Europe"
"These were better received than his former publica¬ tion 5 but contributed little to his reputation as an au¬ thor, and still less to his profit j and his small patri¬ mony being now almost spent, he accepted an invita¬ tion from the marquis of Annandale to come and live with him in England. With this nobleman he staid a twelvemonth ; during which time his small fortune W'as considerably increased. Pie then received an invitation from General St Clair, to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, hut afterwards ended in an excursion against the coast of France. In 1747, he received an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in his mi¬ litary embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. Pie then wore the uniform of an officer; and was introdu¬ ced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, afterwards General Grant. In 1749, he returned to Scotland, and lived two years with his brother at his countryPionse ; where he composed the second part of his essays, called Political Discourses. And now the general approbation of his performances was indicated by a more extensive sale than formerly, and likewise by the numerous an¬ swers published by different persons in order to counter¬ act their supposed pernicious tendency. In 1752, w’ere published at Edinburgh his Political Discourses, the only work of his which was well received on its first appearance ; and the same year at London, his Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which in his own opinion was incomparably the best of all his perform¬ ances. This year also he was appointed librarian to the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh ; the principal ad¬ vantage resulting from which employment was, that he had by that means the command of a large library. He then formed the plan of writing the History of Eng¬ land : but deeming the whole to be too extensive, he confined his history to that of Britain under the house of Stuart. The book was almost universally decried on its first appearance, and soon after seemed to sink in oblivion. Dr Herring, primate of England, and Dr Stone, primate of Ireland, were the only literati of the author’s acquaintance who approved of the work, and sent him messages not to be discouraged","Annandale, Vienna, Turin, Erskine, Edinburgh, London, Edinburgh, Stuart","GB,US,CA,FR,IE,IT",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Canada,France,Ireland,Italy","Europe,North America,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Notwithstanding the approbation of these eminent men, however, Mr Hume’s spirits were so much sunk by his bad success, that he had some thoughts of retir¬ ing to France, changing his name, and bidding adieu to his own country for ever ; but his design was ren¬ dered impracticable by the breaking out of the war of 1755 between France and Britain. He then published his Natural History of Religion ; to which an answer was published, soon after its appearance, in the name of Dr Hurd bishop of Litchfield and Coventry; of which, however, he since disclaimed being the sole Hume, author. In I75^> second volume of the His- ■ y— tory of the Stuarts was, published, two years after the appearance of the first. This was better received, and helped to retrieve the character of the former volume. Three years after, his History of the House of Tudor made its appearance ; which was almost as ill received as the History of the Stuarts had been, the reign of Elizabeth being particularly obnoxious. The author, however, had now learned to despise popular clamours; and continued to finish at his leisure the more early part of the English history, which was published in 1761, and was received with tolerable success","Coventry, Elizabeth","FR,US,UK",6,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"Mr Hume being now turned of fifty, and having ob¬ tained by the sale of his books a competent and inde¬ pendent fortune, retired into his native country of Scotland, determined never more to set his foot out of it. From this resolution, however, he was diverted by the earl of Hertford ; whom he attended as secre¬ tary on his embassy to Paris in 1763. In 1765, the earl being appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Mr Hume was intrusted with the sole management of the business of the state till the arrival of the duke of Richmond towards the latter end of the year. In 1767, lie returned to Edinburgh, with a much larger income, procured to him by the earl of Hertford, than he formerly had ; and now formed the same design he had formerly entertained, namely, of burying himself in his philosophical retreat. In this, however, he was again disappointed, by receiving an invitation from Ge¬ neral Conway to be under secretary ; and this invita¬ tion he was prevented from declining, both by the character of the person, and his connexions with Lord Hertford. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh, pos¬ sessed of IQ00I. a-year, healthy, and though some¬ what stricken in years, yet having a prospect of long enjoying his ease, and of seeing the increase of his re¬ putation. Of his last illness and character, he him¬ self gives the following account. In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels ; which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits ; inso¬ much, that were I to name the period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this latter period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty- five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities ; and though I see many symptoms of my literary repu¬ tation breaking out at last with additional lustre, I know that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present","Hertford, Paris, Richmond, Edinburgh, Hertford, Conway, Hertford, Edinburgh, Of","GB,US,IE,ZA,TR",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Ireland,South Africa,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa,Asia"

"Hippocrates has observed, that children are more affected by abstinence than young persons; these, more than the middle-aged ; and the middle-aged, more than old men. The power to endure famine, however, must depend no less upon the state of health and strength than on the age of the sufferer. There are also parti¬ cular constitutions which do not suffer much pain from the calls of hunger. Dr Percival was informed by a young physician from Geneva, that when he was a stu¬ dent at Montpelier, he fasted three nights and four days, with no other refreshment than a pint of water daily. His hunger was keen, but never painful, during the first and second days of his abstinence; and the two following days, he perceived only a faintness when he attempted either bodily or mental exertion : A sense of coldness was diffused over his whole frame, but more particularly affected the extremities. His mind was in a very unusual state of pusillanimity; and he expe¬ rienced a great tendency to tears whenever he recollec¬ ted the circumstance which had been the occasion of his fasting. During the whole period, the alvine ex¬ cretions were suppressed, but not those by the kidneys: and at the close of it, his skin became tinged with a shade of yellow. The first food he took was veal broth ; which had something of an intoxicating effect, produ¬ cing a glow of warmth, and raising bis spirits, so as to render him ashamed of his despondency. Perhaps in the case of Sextius Baculus, as recorded in the com- *].vi. mentaries of Caesar*, the extraordinary courage and prowess which he suddenly exerted, might be aided by the exhilarating effect of sustenance, which, under such circumstances, it is probable he would no longer de¬ cline. The fact, however, evinces, that neither his sickness nor the sensations of hunger had been so vio¬ lent as much to impair his strength of body or vigour of mind. Pomponius Atticus, the celebrated friend ot Cicero, who put a voluntary end to his life in the 77th year of his age by refusing all food, appears to have experienced ease from his disorder, rather than any acute sufferings by famine. “ Sic cum biduo cibo se ab- stinuisset, subito febris decessit, leviorque morbus esse coepit: tamen propositum nihilo secius perigit. Itaque die quinto, postquam id consilium inierat, decessit.” {Corn. Nepos in Vit. Pomp. Attic.') From the former circumstance it has been conjectured, that he did not wholly deny himself the use of water, or of some other diluent. But though a few examples of this kind may be adduced, we have the evidence of numerous melan¬ choly facts to show, that the pressure of want is agoni- ^ Gold- zing to the human frame. “ I have talked (says an ingenious writer J) with a captain of a ship, who was £, one of six that endured it in its extremity, and who w .’I2(jt was the only person that had ,not lost his senses when they received accidental relief. He assured me his Hunger, pains at first were so great, as to be often tempted to —v->— eat a part of one of the men who died, and which the rest ot his crew actually for some time lived upon","Geneva, Cicero",US,6,United States,North America

This plunderer, whom he found to be a young gentleman in the service of the East India Com¬ pany, afterwards acknowledged, that he owed his life to the many comfortable draughts which he derived from him. Before Mr Holwell adopted this mode of relief, he had attempted, in an ungovernable fit of thirst, to drink his own urine: but it was so intensely bitter, that a second taste- could not be endured ; whereas, he assures us, no Bristol water could be more soft and pleasant than his perspiration.

"Hunter, Dr William, a celebrated anatomist and physician, was born on the 23d of May 1718, at Kilbride fli 'tart Jn t[,e county of Lanerk in Scotland. He was the se- (‘nUS venl^ ^ie children of John and Agnes Hunter, who •Vfr presided on a small estate in that parish called Zorcg Cal- igs of derwood, which had been long in the possession of his ' ' family. His great grandfather by his father’s side, ‘ r' was a younger son of Hunter of Hunterston, chief of the family of that name. At the age of fourteen his father sent him to the college of Glasgow. In this se¬ minary he passed five years, and by his prudent beha¬ viour and diligence acquired the esteem of the profes¬ sors, and the reputation of being a good scholar. His father had designed him for the church : but the idea of subscribing to articles of faith was so repugnant to the liberal mode of thinking he had already adopted, that he felt an insuperable aversion to his theological pursuits. In this state of mind he happened to be¬ come acquainted with Hr Cullen, the late celebrated professor at Edinburgh, who was then just established in practice at Hamilton under the patronage of the duke of Hamilton. Dr Cullen’s conversation soon de¬ termined him to lay aside all thoughts of the church, and to devote himself to the profession of physic. His father’s consent having been previously obtained, Mr Hunter in 1737 went to reside with Dr Cullen. In the family of this excellent friend and preceptor he passed nearly three years : and these, as he has been often heard to acknowledge, were the happiest years of his life. It was then agreed, that he should go and prosecute his medical studies at Edinburgh and Lon¬ don, and afterwards return to settle at Hamilton in HUN partnership with Dr Cullen. He accordingly set out Hunter, for Edinburgh in November 1740; and continued there —y—— till the following spring, attending the lectures of the medical professors, and amongst others those of the late Dr Alexander Monro, who many years afterwards, in allusion to this circumstance, styled himself his old master","Glasgow, Edinburgh, Hamilton, Hamilton, Edinburgh, Hamilton, Edinburgh","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Mr Hunter arrived in London in the summer of 1741, and took up his residence at Mr, afterwards Dr, Smellie’s, who was at that time an apothecary in Pall Mall. He brought with him a letter of recommenda¬ tion to his countryman Dr James Douglas, from Mr Foulis, printer in Glasgow, who had been useful to the doctor in collecting for him different editions of Ho¬ race. Dr Douglas was then intent on a great anato¬ mical work on the bones, which he did not live to complete, and was looking out for a young man of abilities and industry whom he might employ as a dis¬ sector. This induced him to pay particular attention to Mr Hunter; and finding him acute and sensible, he desired him to make him another visit. A second con¬ versation confirmed the doctor in the good opinion he had formed of Mr Hunter ; and without any farther hesitation he invited him into his family to assist in his dissections and to superintend the education of his son.—Mr Hunter having accepted Dr Douglas’s invi¬ tation, was by his friendly assistance enabled to enter himself as a surgeon’s pupil at St George’s Hospital under Mr James Wilkie, and as a dissecting pupil un¬ der Dr Frank Nichols, who at that time taught ana¬ tomy with considerable reputation. He likewise at¬ tended a course of lectures on experimental philosophy by Dr Desaguliers. Of these means of improvement he did not fail to make a proper use. He soon became expert in dissection, and Dr Douglas was at the ex¬ pence of having several of his preparations engraved","London, Douglas, Glasgow, Ho, Of","GB,US,GH,TR",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Ghana,Turkey","Europe,North America,Africa,Asia"
"But before many months had elapsed, he had the mis¬ fortune to lose this excellent friend.—The death of Dr Douglas, however, made no change in the situation of our author.

"In 1747 he was admitted a member of the corpora¬ tion of surgeons j and in the spring of the following year, soon after the close of his lectures, he set out in company with his pupil, Mr James Douglas, on a tour through Holland to Paris.

"His patron, Dr James Douglas, had acquired consider¬ able reputation in midwifery $ and this probably indu¬ ced Mr Hunter to direct his views chiefly to the same line of practice. His being elected one of the surgeon men-midwives, first to the Middlesex, and soon after¬ wards to the British Lying-in Hospital, assisted in bringing him forward in this branch of his profession, in which he was recommended by several of the most eminent surgeons of that time, who respected his ana¬ tomical talents and wished to encourage him. But these were not the only circumstances that contributed to his success. He owed much to his abilities, and much to his person and manner, which eminently qua¬ lified him for the practice of midwifery",Douglas,US,6,United States,North America
"The same year in which the Tables of the Gravid Uterus made their appearance, Dr Hunter communi¬ cated to the Royal Society an Essay on the Origin of the Venereal Disease. In this paper he attempted to prove, that this dreadful malady was not brought from America to Europe by the crew of Columbus, as had been commonly supposed, although it made its first appearance about th^t period. After this paper had been read to the Royal Society, Dr Hunter, in a con¬ versation with the late Dr Musgrave, was convinced that the testimony on which he placed his chief depen¬ dence was of less weight than he had at first imagined, as many of Martyr’s letters afford the most convincing proofs of their having been written a considerable time after the period of their dates. He therefore very properly laid aside his intention of giving his es¬ say to the public. In the year 1777 Dr Hunter join¬ ed with Mr Watson in presenting to the Royal Society a short account of the late Dr Maty’s illness, and of the appearances on dissection ; and the year following he published his Reflections on the Section of the Symphysis Pubis",Columbus,US,6,United States,North America

"Hunting formed the greatest part of the employment of the ancient Germans, and probably of the Britons also, when they were not engaged in war. We are in¬ formed by some ancient historians, that this was the case even as late as the third century with the uncon¬ quered Britons who lived beyond Adrian’s wall; nay, that they subsisted chiefly by the prey they took in this way. The great attachment shown by all the Celtic nations to hunting, however, proceeded most probably from its being a kind of apprenticeship to war. Thus their youth acquired that courage, strength, swiftness, and dexterity in handling their arms, which made them so formidable in time of war to their enemies. Thus also they freed the country from many mischievous ani¬ mals which abounded in the forests, furnishing them¬ selves also with materials for those feasts which seem to have constituted their greatest pleasure. The young chieftains had thus likewise an opportunity of paying court to their mistresses, by displaying their bravery and agility, and making them presents of their game j nay, so strong and universal was the passion for hunting among the ancient Britons, that young ladies of the highest quality and greatest beauty spent much of their time in the chase. They employed much the same wea* Hunting, pons in hunting that they did in war, viz. long spears, —v— javelins, and bows and arrows j having also great num¬ bers of dogs to assist them in finding and pursuing their game. These dogs, we are also told, were much ad¬ mired among other nations, on account of their swift¬ ness, strength, fierceness, and exquisite sense of smell¬ ing. They were of several different kinds, called by different names, and formed a considerable article of commerce. They were highly valued by all the Celtic nations, insomuch that some very comical penalties were inflicted upon those who were convicted of stealing them (a). From the poems of Ossian also it appears, that the Britons were not unacquainted with the art of catching birds with hawks trained for that purpose j but they seem to have been absolutely ignorant of the method of catching fish j for there is not a single allu¬ sion to this art in all the works of that venerable bard",Adrian,US,6,United States,North America
"Fire was then set to the grass in a great number of places, and a terrible noise made with drums, horns, shouting, and whistling. The hunters gradually con¬ tracted their circle, continuing the noise till the game were inclosed in a very small space. They were then killed or taken in snares, or with the hands of the hunters. The number of animals taken or destroyed on these occasions was so great, that the first Spanish viceroy of Mexico would not believe it without ma¬ king the experiment himself. The place chosen for his hunting-match was a great plain in the country of 4 Q 2 the (a) Si quis canem veltraum aut segutium vel petrunculum, praesuraserit involare, jubemus ut convictus, coram artuu populo, posteriora ipsius osculetur",,"MX,ES",6,"Mexico,Spain","North America,Europe"
"Notwithstanding the general passion among most na¬ tions for hunting, however, it has by many been deem¬ ed an exercise inconsistent with the principles of huma¬ nity. The late king of Prussia expressed himself on this subject in the following manner. “ The chase is one of the most sensual of pleasures, by which the powers of the body are strongly exerted, but thostf of the mind remain unemployed. It is an exercise which makes the limbs strong, active, and pliable : but leaves the head without improvement. It consists in a violent desire in the pursuit, and the indulgence of a cruel pleasure in the death, of the game. I am convinced that man is more cruel and savage than any beast of prey : We'exercise the dominion given us over these our fellow-creatures in the most tyrannical manner. It we pretend to any superiority over the beasts, it ought certainly to consist in reason ; but we commonly find that the most passionate lovers of the chase renounce this privilege, and converse only with their dogs, horses, and other irrational animals. This renders them wild and unfeeling ; and it is probable that they cannot be very merciful to the human species. For a man who can in cold blood torture a poor innocent animal, can¬ not feel much compassion for the distresses of his own species. And, besides, can the chase be a proper em¬ ployment for a thinking mind ?” The arguments used by his majesty against hunting seem indeed to be much confirmed by considering the various nations who have most addicted themselves to it. These, as must be seen from what has already been said, were all barbarous; and it is remarkable, that Nimrod, the first great hunter of whom we have any account, was likewise the first who oppressed and en¬ slaved his own species. As nations advanced in civili¬ zation, it always became necessary to restrain by law the inclination of the people for hunting. This was done by the wise legislator Solon, lest the Athenians should neglect the mechanic arts on its account. The Lacedaemonians, on the contrary, indulged themselves in this diversion without controul ; but they were bar¬ barians, and most cruelly oppressed those whom they had in their power, as is evident from their treatment of the Helots. The like may be said of the Egyptians, Persians, and Scythians) all of whom delighted in war, and oppressed their own species. The Romans, on the other hand, who were somewhat more civilized, were less addicted to hunting. Even they, however, were exceedingly barbarous, and found it necessary to make death.and slaughter familiar to their citizens from their infancy. Hence their diversions of the amphi¬ theatre and circus, where the hunting of wild beasts was shown in the most magnificent and cruel manner; not to mention their still more cruel sport ol gladia¬ tors, &c",Solon,US,6,United States,North America

"There were other circumstances that contributed to inflame the resentment of the clergy against him. He adopted the philosophical opinions of the realists, and vehemently opposed and even persecuted the nomina¬ lists, whose number and influence wrere considerable in the university of Prague. He also multiplied the num¬ ber of his enemies in the year 1408, by procuring through his great credit, a sentence in favour of the Bohemians, who disputed with the Germans concern¬ ing the number of suffrages which their respective na¬ tions were intitled to in all matters that were carried by election in this university. In consequence of a de¬ cree obtained in favour of the former, which restored them to their constitutional right of three suffrages, usurped by the latter, the Germans withdrew from Prague, and, in the year 1409, founded a new aca¬ demy at Leipsick. This event no sooner happened, than Huss began to inveigh with greater freedom than he had before done against the vices and corruptions of the clergy, and to recommend, in a public manner, the writings and opinions of Wickliffe, as far as they re¬ lated to the papal hierarchy, the despotism of the court of Rome, and the corruption of the clergy. Hence an accusation was brought against him, in the year 1410, before the tribunal of John XXIII. by whom he was solemnly expelled from the communion of the church.

To Mr James Davie, a young man nearly of liis own age, with whom he contracted a friendship which death only could extinguish, he also communi¬ cated the perplexed state of his mind. Their mutual knowledge of the nature of sal ammoniac led them to establish this manufacture, which afterwards became a most lucrative concern to both. The sentiments of Mr Davie were communicated to Dr Hutton while yet in London, which probably was the chief reason why he resolved to abandon entirely the practice of physic","London, Edinburgh, Davie, London","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"On his return to Edinburgh, in the year 1750, he resolved to devote all his attention to agriculture, which might probably be occasioned by his having succeeded to a small property in Berwickshire on the death of his lather. Mr Play lair of the university of Edinburgh has ascribed it, and we apprehend with great propriety, to the native simplicity of his character, and the mode¬ ration of his views, which wete always free from ambi¬ tion. His attachment to the life of a farmer was in¬ creased by his acquaintance with Sir John Hall of Dun- glass, a gentleman who was very ingenious, a friend and lover of science, and one who well understood agri¬ culture. Determined to make himself master of rural economy, Dr Hutton went into the county of Norfolk, where he continued for some time in the house of a far¬ mer, who was at once his preceptor and his host. The larmer’s name was John Dybold, whose practical know¬ ledge of agriculture Dr Hutton always mentioned in terms of the highest respect","Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Norfolk","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"During bis residence in this county, which was to him a paradise, he made frequent excursions into dif- terent parts of England; and although information re¬ specting rural economy was the great and primary ob- Hutton ject of his pursuit, yet it was here that he first com- ——y— menced the study of mineralogy, to serve him as an amusement on the road. Fie acquainted his friend Sir John Flail, that he was become remarkably fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was narrowly ex¬ amining every pit, or ditch, or bed of a river that fell in his way. The agricultural knowledge he acquired in Norfolk increased his desire to pay a visit to Flan¬ ders, the only place in Europe where husbandry can boast of the greatest antiquity. He set out accordingly in the spring of 1754, and returned to England during the summer of the same year. Soon after his arrival in London, he observed in a letter to Sir John Hail; “ had I doubted of it before I set out, I should have returned fully convinced that they are good husband¬ men in Norfolk.” About this time be returned to his native country, and was for some time at a loss what place to fix upon for the purpose of carrying into effect his agricultural improvements. His own farm at length became his choice, and a ploughman whom he had brought with him from Norfolk gave the first specimen of excellent tillage ever exhibited in that part of Scotland. To Dr Hutton the country is indebted for the introduction of the new husbandry into a county where it may be said to have made more astonishing progress than in almost any other part of the British empire. In the year 1764, he made an excursion into the north of Scotland, in company with Commissioner Clerk, who was after¬ wards Sir George Clerk, a man of singular worth and abilities. They went by Crieff, Dalwhinnie, F'ort Au¬ gustus, and Inverness, and returned along the coast by Aberdeen to Edinburgh. To increase his knowledge of geology was Dr Hutton’s chief aim in this tour, to which he was now determined to pay the most unremit¬ ting attention. About the year 1768 he devoted his whole time to scientific pursuits, and having met with a favourable opportunity of letting hk farm to advan¬ tage, he took up his constant residence in Edinburgh","Norfolk, London, Norfolk, Norfolk, Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Edinburgh","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"HUYGENS, Christian, one of the greatest ma¬ thematicians and astronomers of the 17th century, was the son of Constantine Huygens, lord of Zuylichem, who had served three successive princes of Orange in the quality of secretary 5 and was born at the Hague, in 1629. He discovered from his infancy an extraor¬ dinary fondness for the mathematics ; in a little time made a great progress in them j and perfected himself in those studies under the famous professor Schooten, at Leyden. In 1649, he went to Holstein and Den¬ mark, in the retinue of Henry count of Nassau ; and was extremely desirous of going to Sweden, in order to see Des Cartes, but the count’s short stay in Den¬ mark, would not permit him. He travelled into France and, England; was, in 1663, made a member of the Royal Society ; and, upon his return into France, M. Colbert, being informed of his merit, settled a con¬ siderable pension upon him to engage him to fix at Pa¬ ris ; to which Mr Huygens consented, and staid there from the year 1666 to 1681, where he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. He lived a quiet and studious manner of life, and frequently re¬ tired into the country to avoid interruption, but did not contract that moroseness which is so frequently the effect of solitude and retirement. He was the first who discovered Saturn’s ring, and a third satellite belong¬ ing to that planet, which had hitherto escaped the eyes of astronomers. He discovered the means of render¬ ing clocks exact, by applying the pendulum, and ren¬ dering all its vibrations equal by the cycloid. He brought telescopes to perfection, made many other useful discoveries, and died at the Hague in 1695. He 4 S 2 was HUY [ 692 ] H Y A Huygens, was the author of several excellent works. The princi- Huysum. pal of these are contained in two collections ; the first "" of which was printed at Leyden in 1682, in quarto, under the title of Opera vana ; and the second at Am¬ sterdam in 1728, in two volumes quarto, entitled Opera reliqua","Orange, Nassau","FR,SE,US,BS",6,"France,Sweden,United States,Bahamas","Europe,Europe,North America,North America"
"HUYSUM, the name of several Dutch painters j the most celebrated of whom was John, whose sub¬ jects were flowers, fruit, and landscapes. According to Mr Pilkington, this illustrious painter hath sur¬ passed all who have ever painted in that style; and his works excite as much surprise by their finishing as they excite admiration by their truth. He was born at Amsterdam in 1682, and was a disciple of Justus van Huysum his father. He set out in his profession with a most commendable principle, not so much to paint for the acquisition of money as of fame ; and therefore he did not aim at expedition, but at deli¬ cacy, and, if possible, to arrive at perfection in his art. Having attentively studied the pictures of Mig- non, and all other artists of distinction who had paint¬ ed in his own style, he tried which manner would soonest lead him to imitate the lightness and singu¬ lar beauties of each flower, fruit, or plant, and then fixed on a manner peculiar to himself, which seems almost inimitable. His pictures are finished with in¬ conceivable truth; for he painted every thing after nature ; and was so singularly £xact, as to watch even the hour of the day in which his model appeared in its greatest perfection. By the judicious he was ac¬ counted to paint with greater freedom than Mignon or Breughel; with more tenderness and nature than Mario da Fiori, Michael Angelo di Campidoglio, or Segers ; with more mellowness than De Heem, and greater force of colouring than Baptist. His reputa¬ tion rose to such a height at last, that he fixed immo¬ derate prices on his works ; so that none but princes, or those of princely fortunes, could pretend to become purchasers. Six of his paintings were sold at a public sale in Holland for prices that were almost incredible","Amsterdam, Holland","US,NL",6,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"The vast sums which Van Huysum received for his works, caused him to redouble his endeavours to ex¬ cel ; no person was admitted into his room while he was painting, not even his brothers; and his method of mixing the tints, and preserving the lustre of his colours, was an impenetrable secret, which he never would disclose. Yet this conduct is certainly not to his honour, but rather an argument of a low mind, fearful of being equalled or surpassed. From the same principle, he would never take any disciples, except one lady, named Haverman ; and he grew envious and jealous even of her merit. By several domestic disquiets his temper became changed ; he grew morose, fretful, and apt to withdraw himself from society. He had many enviers of his fame, which has ever been the severe lot of the most deserving in all professions ; but he continued to work, and his reputation never dimi¬ nished. It is universally agreed that he has excelled all who have painted fruit and flowers before him, by the confessed superiority of his touch, by the delicacy of his pencil, and by an amazing manner of finishing; nor does it appear probable that any future artist will become his competitor. The care which he took to purify his oils and prepare his colours, and the various jj experiments he made to discover the most lustrous and Hyacin- durable, are instances of extraordinary care and indus- *^UIS' try as well as capacity. From having observed some v*— of his works that were perfectly finished, some only half finished, and others only begun, the principles by which he conducted himself may perhaps be discover¬ able. His cloths were prepared with the greatest care, and primed with white, with all possible purity, to prevent his colours from being obscured, as he laid them on very lightly. He glazed all other colours except the clear and transparent, not omitting even the white ones, till he found the exact tone of the co¬ lour ; and over that he finished the forms, the lights, the shadows and the reflections, which are all execu¬ ted with precision and warmth, without dryness or negligence. The greatest truth, united with the great¬ est brilliancy, and a velvet softness on the surface of his objects, are visible in every part of his composi¬ tions ; and as to his touch, it looks like the pencil of nature. Whenever he represented flowers placed in vases, he always painted those vases after some elegant model, and the bas-relief is as exquisitely finished as any of the other parts. Through the whole he shows a delicate composition, a fine harmony, and a most happy effect of light and shadow. Those pictures which he painted on a clear ground are preferred to others of his hand, as having greatest lustre, and as they demanded more care and exactness in the finish-, ing ; yet there are some on a darkish ground, in which appears rather more force and harmony. It is obser'? ved of him, that in the grouping of his flowers, he generally designed those which wrere brightest in the centre, and gradually decreased the force of his colour from the centre to the extremities. The birds nests and their eggs, the feathers, insects, and drops of dew* are expressed with the utmost truth, so as even to de¬ ceive the spectator. And yet, after all this merited and just praise, it cannot but be confessed, that sometimes his fruits appear like wax or ivory, without that pecu¬ liar softness and warmth which is constantly observable in nature. Beside his merit as a flower painter, he also painted landscapes with great applause. They are well composed ; and although he had never seen Rome, he adorned his scenes with the noble remains of ancient magnificence which are in that city. His pictures in that style are well coloured, and every tree is distinT guished by a touch that is proper for the leafing. The grounds are well broken, and disposed with taste and judgment; the figures are designed in the manner of Lairesse, highly finished, and touched with a great deal of spirit; and through the whole composition the scene represents Italy, in the trees, the clouds, and the skies. He died in 1749, aged 67",Rome,"IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

By the moderns it was called Mel Passi, for the same reason, namely, on ac¬ count of its excellent honey, and extraordinary fertility, till it was overwhelmed by the lava of ./Etna j and hav- 3 ] H Y D ing then become totally barren, its name was changed jiybta to Mai Passi. In a second eruption, by a shower of || ashes from the mountain, it soon reassumed its ancient Hyde, beauty and fertility, and for many years was called v Bel Passi : and, last of all, in the year 1669, it was a- gain laid under an ocean of fire, and reduced to the most wretched sterility j since which time it is again known by the appellation of Mai Passi. However, the lava, in its course over this beautiful country, has left several little islands or hillocks, just sufficient to show what it formerly was.

"The first rudiments of his education he received in. his father’s house, the vicar of the parish being his pre¬ ceptor, under whose tuition he made such rapid pro¬ gress, that he was sent to Oxford at the age of 13, where he studied only for one year in Magdalen-hal), as his father entered him in the Middle Temple, that he might be trained up to the profession of the law",Oxford,US,6,United States,North America
"He repaired to London at the age of 17, being coun¬ tenanced and protected by his uncle, who was after¬ wards chief justice of the court of king’s bench. On the death of his uncle he was still a student, yet such a heavy H Y D [ 694 ] H Y B heavy misfortune did not deter him from the prosecu¬ tion of his designs. As a licentiousness of manners was at that time extremely prevalent, the well-disposed part of the community considered early marriage as a commendable preservative against irregularity of con¬ duct ; and therefore in compliance with an opinion so respectable, Mr Hyde united himself in wedlock with a beautiful young lady, when he wTas only in the 2ist year of his age, whom he had the misfortune to lose in six months after the celebration of their nuptials, she having fallen a victim to that loathsome malady the smallpox. After a widowhood of three years continu¬ ance, he married the daughter of Sir Thomas Ayles¬ bury, with whom he lived 36 years in conjugal felici¬ ty. He considered it as a fortunate circumstance that he was made acquainted at an early period with a num¬ ber of very distinguished character’s, among whom we find the names of Lord Falkland, Selden, Kenelm Dig- hv, Carew, Sheldon, May, Waller, Hales of Eton, Morley, Chillingworth, and others 5 of whom he has made respectable mention in memoirs written by him¬ self; and to their instructive conversation he nobly a- scribes the principal part of his literary acquisitions","London, Selden, Morley","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"When the commons published their remonstrance on the state of the nation, Hyde drew up a reply to it, merely to gratify his own personal indignation, accord¬ ing to his own confession, without the smallest intention of making it public, although it is more than probable that Lord Higby was made acquainted with its con¬ tents. He was, however, at length prevailed upon to allow it to appear as the king’s answer with the advice of h is council. This procured him an offer of the office of solicitor-general, which he thought proper to decline, although he undertook the management of the king’s affairs in parliament, in conjunction with Lord Higby and Sir John Colepepper. Fie opposed the king’s as¬ sent to the bill for depriving the bishops of their seats in the house of peers, in which the sovereign acted in direct opposition to the sentiments of his professed friend, by giving his assent. In the year 1642 his majesty sent for Hyde to York, where he contributed his as¬ sistance in drawing up various papers in the cause of the falling monarch. He was recalled by parliament, but he refused to obey the summons without the royal permission, which excluded him from pardon by a vote of the house","Hyde, York","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Soon after the breaking out of hostilities between the king and parliament, when the court of the former was held at Oxford, Hyde was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, sworn a member of the privy council, and created a knight. He continued with his majesty till the month of March 1644, when he was appointed to accompany Prince Charles to the west, and afterwards to the island of Jersey, where Sir Edward Hyde con¬ tinued during two years after the departure of the prince, prosecuting his studies with indefatigable in¬ dustry, and composing a history of those memorable transactions in which he himself had borne a distinguish¬ ed part. He likewise published a reply to the parlia¬ mentary declaration of February 1647, in which it was declared improper to send any more addresses to the king. In 1648 he received orders to attend the prince at Paris, who having in the mean time set out for Hol¬ land, Sir Edward took shipping for Hunkirk. The prince was at the Plague when he received the melan¬ choly intelligence of his royal father’s fate. Upon this the council of the young king determined to send am¬ bassadors to Spain, and for this purpose made choice of Sir Edward Hyde and Lord Collington, who arrived at Madrid in 1694 $ and when their residence in that me¬ tropolis H Y D C 695 ] H Y D i(je- tropolis was no longer necessary, Sir Edward returned j to Paris. Tlie king’s court at the Hague was torn by dissension, which made Sir Edward apply for, and ob¬ tain leave to retire to Antwerp, the residence of his wife and children, as he clearly perceived that his personal attendance was not likely to be productive of any substantial good. This retreat afforded him lit- terary and domestic happiness, and was better suited to the reduced state of his finances.

"He was chosen chancellor of the university of Oxford in 1690, and at the same time created a peer; being in the year following made Viscount Cornbnry and earl of Clarendon. But as his new dignity was far superior to bis fortune, the crown made several grants to him to enable him to support it. This sudden elevation, aaid the strictness of his moral deportment, which bordered on austerity, did not fail to create a number of enemies in such a licentious court as tha.t of Charles II",Oxford,US,6,United States,North America
"It would perhaps be improper to omit a remarkable circumstance respecting bis daughter, who was a maid of honour to the princess of Orange, as it had every ap¬ pearance of affecting his future fortune in a very ma¬ terial degree. The duke of York was so captivated with the charms of his lordship’s daughter, that he en¬ tered with her into a private contract of marriage, when he found it impracticable to triumph over her virtue, or procure her for a mistress. Finding herself pregnant, she boldly insisted that the duke would make an open avowal of their marriage, which rendered it necessary to make the king acquainted with it; but when it readied the ears of her father, he behaved on the occasion in such a manner, as greatly to tarnish a 5 character so illustrious. He said he would rather see Hyde, his daughter the duke’s mistress than his consort; ad- —y— vised to confine her in the Tower, and even asserted that she ought to lose her head. He was afraid of the king’s indignation, from a supposition that he was privy to the marriage, which there is no good reason for be¬ lieving, yet such an apprehension might bring such ex¬ pressions from him as were wholly incompatible with the feelings of a parent. His extravagant notions of royalty might also have their own weight in producing such an unnatural conduct, since he would conceive the blood of majesty to be contaminated by such an alli¬ ance. To the honour of Charles he behaved on the occasion in a very commendable manner; and not¬ withstanding the rage of the queen-mother, the base conduct of the duke in denying his marriage, and at¬ tempting by calumny to impeach the chastity of his consort, she was at length acknowledged as the du¬ chess of York, and became the mother of two English queens","Orange, York, Hyde, York","US,GB,UK",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"Earl Clarendon’s influence with the crown was na¬ turally increased by this marriage, while it as naturally procured him the envy of his fellow courtiers, and pa¬ ved the way to his subsequent degradation. The sale of Dunkirk to the French was viewed as dishonourable by the nation at large, although perhaps on the score of economy and sound policy it was capable of vindi¬ cation. To this we may add the unpopular measure of opposing the bill for granting liberty of conscience, as it brought on him the displeasure both of the king and of all religious sectaries. Even the unfortunate war with the Dutch was charged to his account, although he was known to be its enemy from its very commence¬ ment. Rigidly virtuous himself, the libidinous course of life pursued by his master could not fail to give him offence, and he certainly displeased the king by the freedom of his reproofs. In defiance, therefore, of all his former services, he was basely abandoned to the in¬ dignation of the people, and driven from every office of public trust in the month of August 1667. He was charged with the crime of high-treason by the house of commons, but the peers refused to commit him upon their charge; but while the dispute I ret ween the two houses was yet undetermined, Clarendon received his majesty’s orders to quit the kingdom. His apology to the peers was burnt by the common executioner, and a bill of banishment was issued against him for flying from justice. While he proceeded from Calais to Rouen, the court of France sent an order to him to quit that kingdom, which bodily distress at that time rendered impracticable, upon which the cruel order was reversed. The savage rage of some Englishmen nearly deprived him of his life as he passed from Rouen to Avignon after his recovery; but the court of France punished the perpetrators of the deed. At Montpe¬ lier he met with very respectful treatment during a re¬ sidence of four years, which time he devoted to the vindication of his conduct. Having spent some time at Moulins, he fixed his residence at Rouen, where he ter¬ minated his career in December 1674, in the 68th year of his age. His remains were brought to England, and interred in the abbey of Westminster","Calais, Rouen, Rouen, Avignon, Moulins, Rouen, Westminster","FR,US,NL",6,"France,United States,Netherlands","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Hyde, Dr Thomas, professor of Arabic at Oxford, and one of the most learned writers of the 17th cen¬ tury, was born in 1636 \ and studied first at Cam¬ bridge, and afterwards at Oxford. Before he was 18 years of age, he was sent from Cambridge to London to assist Mr Brian Walton in the great work of the Poly¬ glot Bible ; and about that period undertook to tran¬ scribe the Persian Pentateuch out of the Hebrew cha¬ racters, which Archbishop Usher, who well knew the difficulty of the undertaking, pronounced to be an im¬ possible task to a native Persian. After he had happi¬ ly succeeded in this, he assisted in correcting several parts of Mr Walton’s work, for which he was perfect¬ ly qualified. He was made archdeacon of Gloucester, canon of Christ-church, head keeper of the Bodleian library, and professor both of Hebrew and Arabic in the university of Oxford. He was interpreter and se¬ cretary of the Oriental languages, during the reigns of Charles II. James II. and William III. ; and was perfectly qualified to fill this post, as he could converse in the languages which he understood. There never was an Englishman in his situation of life who made so great a progress $ but his mind was so engrossed by his beloved studies, that he is said to have been but ill qualified to appear to any advantage in common con¬ versation.

"4. In the Greek school at Alexandria which flourish¬ ed under the auspices of the Ptolemies, the first at¬ tempts were made at the construction of hydraulic ma- entions chinery. About 1 20 years after the birth of Christ, r-usibiustjje fountain of compression, the syphon, and the for¬ cing pump, were invented by Ctesibius and Hero ; and though these machines operated by the elasticity and weight of the air, yet their inventors had no distinct notions of these preliminary branches of pneumatical science. The syphon is a simple instrument which is employed to empty vessels full of water or spirituous , ci«S liquors, and is of great utility in the arts. The forcing ' ^ pump, on the contrary, is a complicated and abstruse invention, which could scarcely have been expected in ] pt;an the infancy of hydraulics.

"5. Notwithstanding these inventions of the Alexan-Labours of drian school, its attention does not seem to have been Sextus Ju- directed to the motion of fluids. The first attempt to*‘us investigate this subject was made by Sextus Julius Frontinus, inspector of the public fountains at Rome in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan ; and we may justly suppose that his work entitled De Aqiiceductibus urbis Romce Commentarius contains all the hydraulic know¬ ledge of the ancients. Alter describing the Roman aqueducts, and mentioning the dates of their erection, he considers the methods which were at that time em¬ ployed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from adjutages, and the mode of distributing the waters of an aqueduct or a fountain. He justly remarks that the ex pence of water from an orifice, depended not on¬ ly on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the height of the water in the reservoir ; and that a pipe employed to carry off a portion of water from an aque¬ duct, should, as circumstances required, have a position more or less inclined to the original direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted with the true law of the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth of the orifice, we can scarcely be sur¬ prised at the want of precision which appears in his results","Rome, Roman","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"9, The theorem of Torricelli was employed by many succeedii g writers, but particularly by the celebrated Mariotte, whose labours in this department of physics deserve to be recorded. His TraitS du Mouvementdes eaux, which was published after his death in the year 1686, is founded on a great variety of well conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed at Ver¬ sailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some points, he has committed considerable mistakes. Others he has treated very superficially, and in none of his experiments does he seem to have attended to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the fluid vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate j but he appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of the water’s velocity arising from friction",Chantilly,US,6,United States,North America
"12. The effects of friction and viscidity in diminish-Dil0.1TeFi, ing the velocity of running water were noticed in the«f SirisM' Principia of Sir Isaac Newton, who has thrown much Newton, light upon several branchesof hydrodynamics. Atatime when theCartesian systemof vorticesuniversally prevail¬ ed, this great man found it necessary to investigate that absurd hypothesis, and in the course of his investigation he has shown that the velocity of any stratum of the vor¬ tex is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata which enclosed it ; and from this it evidently follows, that the velocity of a filament of water moving in a pipe is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the filaments which surround it. Taking advantage of these results, it was afterwards shewn by M. Pitot that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves","Newton, Newton",US,6,United States,North America
The attention of Newton was also directed to the dis¬ charge of water from orifices in the bottom ot vessels,Newton,US,6,United States,North America
"He considered the horizontal strata of this hyperboloid as always in motion, while the remainder of the water was in a state of rest; and imagined that there was a kind of cataract in the middle of the fluid. When the results of this theory were compared with the quantity of water actually discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with which the water issued from the ori¬ fice was equal to that which a falling body would re¬ ceive by descending through half the height of water in the reservoir. This conclusion, however, is absolute¬ ly irreconcileable with the known fact, that jets of wa¬ ter rise nearly to the same height as their reservoirs, and Newton seems to have been aware of this objection","Newton, Newton",US,6,United States,North America
"The formation of a cataract is by no means agreeable to the laws of hydrostatics; for when a vessel is emp¬ tied bv the efflux of water through an orifice in its bottom, all the particles of the fluid direct themselves toward this orifice, and therefore no part of it can he considered as in a state of repose, j* oscil- l3- The subject of the oscillation of waves, one of on of"" the most difficult in the science of hydrodynamics, was ve* first first investigated by Sir Isaac Newton. By the 44th Mdered proposition of the 2d hook of his Principia, he has fur- Jffewton. njsjie(| us a method of ascertaining the velocity of the waves of the sea, by observing the time in which thev rise and fall. If the two vertical branches of a syphon which communicate by means of a horizontal branch be filled with a fluid of known density, the two fluid columns when in a state of rest will be in equili- brio and their surfaces horizontal. But it the one co¬ lumn is raised above the level of the other, and left to itself, it will descend below that level, and raise the other’column above it; and after a few oscillations, they will return to a state of repose. Newton occupied himself in determining the duration of these oscilla¬ tions, or the length of a pendulum isochronous to their duration; and he found by a simple process of reason¬ ing, that, abstracting from the efiects of friction, the length of a synchronous pendulum is equal to one-halt of the length of the syphon, that is, of the two vertical branches and the horizontal one, and hence lie dedu¬ ced the isochronism of these oscillations. From this Newton concluded, that the velocity of waves foimed on the surface of water either by the wind or by means of a stone, was in the subduplicate ratio of their size","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,6,United States,North America
"16. The uncertainty of the principle employed by ®k,jecle^ to Daniel Bernouilii, which lias never been demonstrated lb^l^na^au' in a general manner, deprived his results of that confi-j0hn Bcr- dence which they would otherwise have deserved; andnouilli, rendered it desirable to have a theory more certain,wlloreso^ve and depending solely on the fundamental laws of nie* chanics. Maclaurin and John Bernouilii, who were ofmore direct this opinion, resolved the problem by more direct me-methods, thods, the one in his Fluxions, published in 1742; and the other in his Hydraulica nunc primum dctectay et di- recte demonstrate! ex pi'incipiis pure mechanicis, which forms the fourth volume of his works. The method employed by Maclaurin has been thought not suffici¬ ently rigorous ; and that of John Bernouilii is, in the opinion of La Grange, defective in perspicuity and pre- 17. The theory of Daniel Bernouilii was opposed ^ also by the celebrated D’Alembert. When general!- j^rt sing James Bernouilli’s Theory of Pendulums, he dis- pi* ot'dyl covered a principle of dynamics so simple and general, n imics to that it reduced the laws of the motion of bodies to that^e motioa of their equilibrium. He applied this principle to tbe0^ motion of fluids, and gave a specimen of its application at the end of his Dyn amics in 1743. It was more fully developed in his Traite des Fluides, which was published in 1744, where he has resolved, in the most simple and elegant manner, all the problems which re- 4 T 2 late HYDRODYNAMICS",La Grange,US,6,United States,North America

The particular method by which Archimedes detected the fraud of the gold¬ smith is not certainly known ; but it is probable that he did it in the following manner.

"Let AB (fig. 5.) be the vessel which contains the two fluids, suppose mercury and water, and the solid CD. The mercury being heavier than water will sink to the bottom and have m n for its surface, and the water will occupy the space AB m n. The solid ha¬ ving a greater specific gravity than water, will sink in the water (78.) ; but having a less specific gravity than mercury, it will float in the mercury. It will, there¬ fore, be suspended in the fluids, having one por¬ tion C in the water, and the other portion D in the mercury. Now let S be the specific gravity of the mercury, s the specific gravity of the water, <r that of the solid, C the part of the solid in the water, and D the part of the mercury. Then the bulk of the solid is C + D, and its weight «■ X C-J-D: The quantity of wa¬ ter displaced by the part C, or the loss of weight sus¬ tained by the part C, will be C X s; and the quantity of mercury displaced, or the loss of weight sustained by part D, will be D X S. But as the solid is suspended in the fluids, and therefore in equilibrio with them, the whole of its weight is lost. Consequently, the part of its weight which is lost in the water, added to the part lost in the mercury, must be equal to its whole weight, that is, C X s-f-D X S — ^ X C-f-D, orsC-f- SD“fC-j-cD.

"In the experiments which were made by Laplace and Lavoisier on barometers, by boiling the mercury in them for a long time, the convexity of the interior surface of the mercury was often made to disappear. They even succeeded in rendering it concave, but could always re¬ store the convexity by introducing a drop of water into the tube. When the ebullition of the mercury is suf¬ ficiently strong to expel all foreign particles, it often rises to the level of the surrounding fluid, and the de¬ pression is even converted into an elevation",Laplace,US,6,United States,North America
"126. Newton, Clairaut, and other geometers, have attraction maintained, that the action of the capillary tube is sensi- se^n/to* ble at a small distance, and that it is extended to the at any per- Part‘c^es °f fiu’d in the axis of the tube. Laplace and other philosophers who have lately attended to this sub¬ ject, suppose capillary attraction to be like the refrac¬ tive force, and all the chemical affinities, which are not sensible except at imperceptible distances; and it must be allowed that this opinion is consistent with many of the phenomena. It has been often observed that water rises to the same height in glass tubes, of the same bore, whether they be very thin or very thick. The zones of the glass tube therefore, which are at a small distance from the interior surface, do not contribute to the ascent of the water, though in each of these zones, taken sepa¬ rately, the water would rise above its level. When the interior surface of a capillary tube is lined with a very thin coating of an unctuous substance, the water will no longer ascend. Now if the attraction of the glass tube were similar to the attraction of gravity, of electricity, or magnetism, it ought to act through bodies of all kinds, and, notwithstanding the thin coating of grease, should elevate the fluid in which it is immersed","Newton, Laplace",US,6,United States,North America
"127. From these facts Laplace concludes, that the at¬ traction of capillary tubes has not any influence on the elevation or depression of the fluids which they contain, except by determining the inclination of the first planes of the surface of the interior fluid, which are extreme¬ ly near the sides of the tube. He supposes that when Capillary ceptihie distance",Laplace,US,6,United States,North America

"traction of the fluid upon itself, the fluid will in that Auiactiw case attach itself to the tube, and form an anterior tube, ^•c’ which alone will raise tbe fluid. \ 128. ‘ It is interesting, says Laplace, to ascertain the radius of curvature of the surface of water included in ca¬ pillary tubes of glass. This may be known by a curious experiment, which shews at the same time the effects of the concavity and convexity of surfaces. It consists in plunging in water, to a known depth, a capillary tube of which the diameter is likewise known. The lower extremity of the tube is then to be closed with the finger, and the tube being taken out of the water, its external surface must be gently wiped. Upon with¬ drawing the finger in this last situation, the water is seen to subside in the tube and form a drop at its lower base ; but tbe height of tbe column is always greater than the elevation of the water in the tube above the level in tbe common experiment of plunging it in wa¬ ter. This excess in the height is owing to the action of the drop upon tbe column on account of its convexi¬ ty ; and it is observable that the increase in the eleva¬ tion of the water is more considerable, tbe smaller the diameter of the drop beneath. The length of the fluid column which came out by subsidence to form tbe drop, determines its mass ; and as its surface is spherical as well as that of the interior fluid, if we know the height of the fluid above the summit of the drop, and the dis¬ tance of this summit from the plane of the interior bore of the tube, it will be easy to deduce the radii of these two surfaces. Some experiments lead me to conclude that the surface of the interior fluid approaches very nearly to the figure of an hemisphere.’ 129. ‘ The theory which I have adopted, observes the when a same philosopher, likewise gives the explanation andfluidiselt measure of a singular phenomenon presented by experi-'vaU<^ 0,) ment.

"138. That the preceding phenomena really exist when a vessel of water is discharging its contents through an aperture, experience sufficiently testifies. If some small substances specifically heavier than water be thrown in¬ to the fluid when the vessel is emptying itself, they will at first descend vertically, and when they come within a few inches of the bottom they will deviate from this direc¬ tion, and describe oblique curves similar to those in the figure. The contraction of the vein or column of fluid at 0p is also manifest from observation. It was first discovered by Sir Isaac Newton, and denominated the vena contractu. The greatest contraction takes place at a point 0 whose distance from the orifice is equal to cal tube is employed it will be 13 X A 16 In the first case the height of the rvater in the reservoir most be reckoned from the surface of the fluid to the point 0, where the vein ceases to contract; and when a cylindri¬ cal tube is employed, it must be reckoned from the same surface to the exterior aperture of the tube",Newton,US,6,United States,North America

But V is the velocity with which the fluid issues from the orifice m v, and v is the velocity due to the height Dm ; therefoie, smce^the velocities are equal, the proposition is demonstrated","Euclid, Euclid",US,6,United States,North America
"This was first maintained by Sir Isaac Newton, who found that the diameter of the ve?ia contractu was to that of the orifice as 21 to 25. The area therefore of the one was to the area of the other as 21* to 25*, which is nearly the ratio of x to \/ 2. But by mea¬ suring the quantity of water discharged in a given time, and also the area of the vena contracta. Sir Isaac found that the velocity at the vena contractu was that which was due to the whole altitude of the fluid above the ori¬ fice. He therefore concluded, that since the velocity at the orifice was to that at the vena contractu as (h) 1 : ,y/T, and in the latter velocity was that which was due to the whole altitude of the fluid, the former velo¬ city, or that at the orifice, must be that which is due to only half that altitude, the velocities being as the square roots of the heights. Now the difference be¬ tween this theory and that contained in the preceding proposition may be thus reconciled. The velocity found by the preceding proposition is evidently the vertical velocity of the filaments at E, which being immediately above the centre.of the aperture mn are not diverted from their course, and have therefore their vertical equal to their absolute velocity. But the vertical ve¬ locity of the particles between C and E, and E and D, is much less than their absolute velocity, on account of the obliquity of their motion, and also on account of their friction on the sides of the orifice. The mean ver¬ tical velocity, consequently, of the issuing fluid will be much less than the vertical velocity of the particles at E, that is, than the velocity found by the above pro¬ position, or that due to the height Dm. Now7 the ve¬ locity found by Sir Isaac Newton from measuring the quantity of water discharged, was evidently the mean velocity, which ought to be less than the velocity given by the preceding proposition, the two velocities being as I : y'li or as 1 : 1.414. The theorem of Newton therefore may be considered as giving the mean velocity at the orifice, while our proposition gives the velocity of the particles at D, or the velocity at the vena contracta","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,6,United States,North America

"254. The explanation of the oscillation of waves con¬ tained in the two preceding propositions, was first given by Sir Isaac Newton, in his Principia, lib. ii. Prop. 44, He considered it only as an approximation to the truth, since it supposes the waves to rise and fall perpendicu¬ larly like the water in the vertical branches of the sy¬ phon, while their real motion is partly circular. The theory of Newton was, nevertheless, adopted by suc¬ ceeding philosophers, and gave rise to many analogous discussions respecting the undulation of waves. Very Xew theory lately, however, an attempt has been made by M. Flau-of the for-' gergues, to overturn the theory of Newton. From &niation of number of experiments on the motion and figure 0|'wave*by waves, an account of which may he seen in the/owrwo/^j.^' des Sfavans, for October 1789, M. Flaugergues con-'""’ ° eludes, that a wave is not the result of a motion in the particles of water, by which they ascend and descend alternately in a serpentine line, when moving from the place where the water received the shock ; but that it is an intumescence which this shock occasions around the place where it is received, by the depression that is there produced. This intumescence afterwards propagates itself circularly, while it removes from the place where the shock first raised it above the level of the stagnant water. A portion of the stagnant water then flows from all sides into the hollow formed at the place where the shock was received ; this hollow is thus heaped with fluid, and the water is elevated so as to produce all around another intumescence, or a new wave, which propagates itself circularly as before","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,6,United States,North America
"The repetition of this effect produces on the surface of the water a number of concentric rings, successively elevated and depressed, which have the appearance of an undulatory motion. This interesting subject has also been discussed by M. La Grange, in Ins Mecha- nique Analytiqve, to which we must refer the reader for farther information.

The preceding table, computed by Mr Brew¬ ster (Appendix to Ferguson’s Lectures, vol. ii. p. 174*) supposes, according to theory, that the velocity ot the wheel, at the maximum eftect, is one-half that of the stream, which is nearly the case in practice, when the quantities of water discharged by the stream are consi¬ derable. “ When we consider, however, (observes the “ editor of the work now quoted), that after every “ precaution has been observed, a small quantity of “ water will escape between the mill course and the “ extremities of the floatboards, and that the effect is “ diminished by the resistance of the air and the dis- “ persion of water carried up by the wheel, the pro- “ priety of making the wheel move with three-sevenths “ tlle velocity of the water will appear. The chevalier “ de Borda supposes it never to exceed three-eighths; Cn “ and MrSmeaton and the abbe Bossut found two-fifths W “ to he the proper medium (y). With three-sevenths, ' therefore, as the best medium, which iliffers only “ -yyth from -J-ths, the numbers in the following talile “ have been computed.

On account of the friction of the screw, the re¬ sistance of the air, and the weight of the wheel, its centre of impression will revolve with a little less velo¬ city than that of the stream ; but the diminution of ve¬ locity, arising from these causes, may be estimated with sufficient precision for all the purposes of the prac¬ tical mechanic. {Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 177.) 289. It appears, from a comparison of the numerousRe uks of and accurate experiments of Mr Smeaton, that, in un. Smtajon’s dershot wheels, the power employed to turn the wheel is to the effect produced as 3 to I ; and that the load which the wheel will carry at its maximum, is to the load which will totally stop it, as 3 to 4. The same experiments inform us, that the impulse of the water on the wheel, in the case of a maximum, is more than double of what is assigned by theory, that is, instead of four-sevenths of the column, it is nearly equal to the whole column. In order to account for this, Mr Smea¬ ton observes, that the wheel was not, in this case, pla¬ ced in an open river, where the natural current, after it had communicated its impulse to the float, has room on all sides to escape, as the theory supposes ; but in a conduit or race, to which the float being adapted, the water could not otherwise escape than by moving along with the wheel. He likewise remarks, that when a wheel works in this manner, the water, as soon as it meets the float, receives a sudden check, and rises up against it like a wave against a fixed object; insomuch, that when the sheet of water is not a quarter of an inch thick before it meets the float, yet this sheet will act upon the whole surface of a float, whose height is three inches. Were the flo^t, therefore, no higher than the thickness of the sheet of water, as the theory supposes, a great part of the force would be lost by the water dashing over it. In order to try what would be the effect of diminishing the number of floatboards, Mr Smeaton reduced the floatboards, which were original¬ ly 24, to 12. This change produced a diminution of the effect, as a greater quantity of water escaped be¬ tween the floats and the floor. But when a circular sweep was adapted to the floor, and made of such a length that one float entered the curve before the pre¬ ceding one quitted it, the effect came so near to the for¬ mer, as to afford no hopes of increasing it by augment¬ ing the number of floats beyond 24 in this particular wheel.

If the rising-pipe be made wide, and thus room he made for the air to escape freely up through the wa¬ ter, it will rise to the height assigned ; but if it he nar¬ row, so that the air cannot get up, it rises almost as slow as the water, and by this circumstance the water is raised to a much greater height mixed with air, and this with hardly anv more power. It is in this way that we can account for the great performance of the Flo¬ rentine mac hine, which is almost triple of what a man can do with the finest pump that ever was made : in¬ deed the performance is so great, that one is apt to sus¬ pect some inaccuracy in the accounts. The entry into the rising-pipe should be no wider than the last part of the spiral ; and it would be advisable to divide it into four channels by a thin partition, and then to make the rising-pipe very wide, and to put into it a number ot slender rods, which would divide it into slender chan¬ nels that would completely entangle the air among the water. This will greatly increase the height of the he¬ terogeneous column. It is surprising that a machine that is so very promising should have attracted so little notice. We do not know of any being erected out of Switzerland, except at Florence in 1778. The account of its performance was in consequence of a very public trial in 1779, and honourable declaration of its merit, by Sig. Lorenzo Ginori, who erected another, which fully equalled it. It is shortly mentioned by Professor Sulzer of Berlin, in the Sammlungen Vermischlen Schri- sten for 1754. A description of it is published by the Philosophical Society at Zurich in 1766, and in the descriptions published by the Society in London for the encouragement of Arts in 1776. The celebrated Da¬ niel Bernouilli has published a very accurate theory of it in the Petersburgh Commentaries for 1772, and the machines at Florence were erected according to his in¬ structions. Baron Alstromer in Sweden caused a glass model of it to he made, to exhibit the internal motions for the instruction of artists, and also ordered an opera¬ tive engine to be erected; but we have not seen any account of its performance.
