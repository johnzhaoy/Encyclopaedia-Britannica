"When all was ready, Captain Bruce with 20 sepoys, grenadiers, ascended without being discovered, and squatted down under the parapet $ but before a rein¬ forcement arrived, three of the party had so little re¬ collection as to fire on some of the garrison who hap¬ pened to be lying asleep near them. This had nearly ruined the whole plan : the garrison were of course alarmed, and ran in great numbers towards the place $ but ignorant of the strength of the assailants (as the men fired on had been killed outright), they suffered themselves to be stopped by the warm fire kept up by the small party of the grenadiers, until Major Popham himself, with a considerable reinforcement, came to their aid. The garrison then retreated to the inner buildings, and discharged a few rockets, but soon af¬ terwards retreated precipitately through the gate j whilst the principal officers, thus deserted, assembled together in one house, and hung out a flag. Major Popham sent an officer to give them assurance of quar¬ ter and protection ; and thus, in the space of two hours, this important and astonishing fortress was com¬ pletely in our possession.

"The Ladrone islands, and Guam in particular, were covered with inhabitants when they were discover¬ ed. It is said that Guam alone contained upon its coast more than 30,000 people. These men were fe¬ rocious savages and bold thieves, as all the islanders in the South seas are, undoubtedly because they were un¬ acquainted with the rights of property ; but they were so savage, so incapable of supporting the yoke or ci¬ vilization, that the Spaniards, who undertook to bring them under the regulations of law and order, have seen their numbers almost annihilated within the space of two centuries. Under the government of their missionaries, these fierce islanders, after having long defended, by cruel wars, the right of living like wild beasts under the guidance of instinct, being at last ob¬ liged to yield to the superiority of the Spanish arms, gave themselves up to despair : they took the resolu¬ tion of administering potions to their women, in order to procure abortions, and to render them sterile, that they might not bring into the world, and leave behind them, beings that were not free, according to the ideas that they had of liberty. A resolution so vio¬ lent, G U A [ 123 ] G U A 1. lent, and so contrary to the views and intentions of —' nature, was persisted in with so much obstinacy in the nine Ladrone islands, that their population, which at the time of the discovery consisted of more than 60,000 souls, does not now exceed 800 or 900 in the whole extent of the archipelago. About 20 or 30 years ago, the scattered fragments of the original natives were collected and established in the island of Guam, where they now begin to recover by the wise precautions, and prudent, though tardy, exertions of a government more adapted to the climate of these islands and to the genius of their inhabitants",,"GU,ES",6,"Guam,Spain","Oceania,Europe"
"The centre of the island is still uncleared. The trees are not very tall, but they are fit for the building of houses and of boats. The forests are in general very thick. The Spaniards at first cleared certain portions of land to turn them into savannahs for the feeding of cattle. The formation of savannahs consists in multiplying within the forests small cleared spots separated only by thickets and rows of trees, and kept clean from shrubs of every kind. The Spaniards sow these spots with grass seeds, and other indigenous plants that are fit for pasturage. These meadows, be¬ ing effectually shaded on every quarter, preserve their freshness, and afford the flocks and herds a shelter from the sun and the great heat of noon. The cattle that were formerly brought to the savannahs of Guam from America have multiplied astonishingly : they are become wild, and must be shot when wanted, or taken by stratagem",,GU,6,Guam,Oceania
"The rivers of Guam, which are either rivulets or torrents, abound in fish of an excellent quality : the Indians, however, eat none of them, but prcfer'the in¬ habitants of the sea.

"GUINEA, a large tract of country lying oil the west side of the continent of Africa, extends along the coast three or four thousand miles, beginning at the river Senegal, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude (being the nearest part of Guinea as well to Europe as to North America). From that river to the river Gambia, and in the southerly course to Cape Sierra Leona, is comprehended a coast of about 700 miles ; being the same tract for which Queen Elizabeth grant¬ ed charters to the first traders to that coast.

"This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable •, pro¬ ducing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bosnian, princi¬ pal factor for the Dutch at D’Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold Coast, says, “ The negro inha¬ bitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold : That they are industri¬ ously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture 5 but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here Guinea, in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence all over the Gold Coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, re¬ turning full fraught with millet, jamms, potatoes, and palm oik” The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, “ This country, as well as the Gold Coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees 5 its valleys, betwixt the lulls, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.” He adds, “ In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts 5 but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.” The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, “ was formerly so powerful and po¬ pulous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations ; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined j there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may he compared to the country of Ante just before described j frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and po¬ pulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agri¬ culture 5 some soav corn •, others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.” Smith gives much the same account of the before- mentioned parts of the Gold Coast ; and adds, “ the country about D’Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous 5 and the nearer we come towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow with¬ in the torrid zone.” Barbot also remarks*, rvith re-* spect to the countries of Ante and Adorn, “ That theDficflft soil is very good and fruitful in corn and other pro-°J duce ; which it affords in such plenty, that besides whatP'1^' serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale : they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and Avild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish ; so that nothing is Avanting for the sup¬ port of life and to make it easy.” In the Collection it is said, “ That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and sup¬ ply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine ; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as Avell by Euro¬ peans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.” These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable j not apt to shed human blood, except Avhen much provoked ; and ready to assist one ano¬ ther. In the Collection it is said, “ That the fish¬ ing business is esteemed on the Gold Coast next to tra¬ ding $ that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Kor- mantin 5 from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes, CG G U I [ a. canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread them- selves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish j a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.” Smith says, “ The country about Acra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very de¬ lightful, and the natives courteous and civil to stran¬ gers.” He adds, “ That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not un¬ common to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves. The Malay people are generally natives of Malacca, in the East Indies, situated several thousand miles from the Gold Coast.” They differ very much from the Guinea negroes, being of a tawney complexion with long black hair","Elmina, Axim, Gold Coast, Gold Coast, Gold Coast, Elmina, Cape Coast, Gold Coast, Malacca, Gold Coast","AU,GH,GN,NL,MY,BA,IN,UK",6,"Australia,Ghana,Guinea,Netherlands,Malaysia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,India,N/A","Oceania,Africa,Africa,Europe,Asia,Europe,Asia,N/A"
"Most parts of the Slave Coast are represented as equally fertile and pleasant with the Gold Coast. The kingdom of Whidah has been particularly noted by travellers. Smith and Bosman agree “ That it is one of the most delightful countries in the world. The great number and variety of tall, beautiful, and shady trees, which seem planted in groves; the verdant fields everywhere cultivated, and no otherwise divided than by those groves, and in some places a small foot-path, together with a great number of villages, contribute to afford the most delightful prospect; the whole coun¬ try being a fine, easy, and almost imperceptible ascent for the space of 40 or 50 miles from the sea.

"the negroes of North Guinea and the Gold Coast are said to be fond of their children, whom they love with tenderness. And Bosman says, p. 340. “ Not a few in his country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine, that pa¬ rents here sell their children, men their wives, and one brother the other: but those who think so, deceive themselves 5 for this never happens on any other ac¬ count but that of necessity, or some great crime.” The same is repeated by J. Barbot, p. 326. and also confirmed by Sir Hans Sloane in the introduction to his natural history of Jamaica ; where, speaking of the negroes, he says, “ they are usually thought to be ha¬ ters of their own children ; and therefore it is believed that they sell and dispose of them to strangers for mo¬ ney : but this is not true •, for the negroes of Guinea being divided into several captainships, as well as the Indians of America, have wars ; and besides those slain in battle, many prisoners are taken, who are sold as slaves, and brought thither : but the parents here, al¬ though their children are slaves for ever, yet have so great love for them, that no masters dare sell or give away one of their little ones unless they care not whe¬ ther their parents hang themselves or not.” J. Bar¬ bot, speaking of the occasion of the natives of Guinea being represented as a treacherous people, ascribes it to the Hollanders (and doubtless other Europeans) usurp¬ ing authority, and fomenting divisions between the ne¬ groes. At p. no. he says, “ It is well known that many of the European nations, trading amongst these people, have very unjustly and inhumanly, without any provocation, stolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coast, but almost every¬ where in Guinea, who have come on board their ships in a harmless and confiding manner : these they have in great numbers carried away, and sold in the plantations, with other slaves which they had purchased.” And al¬ though some of the negroes may he justly charged with indolence and supineness, yet many others are frequent¬ ly mentioned by authors as a careful, industrious, and even laborious people","Gold Coast, Holland, Bar","GN,JM,AU,US,UA",6,"Guinea,Jamaica,Australia,United States,Ukraine","Africa,North America,Oceania,North America,Europe"
"By an inquiry into the laws and customs formerly in use, and still in force among the negroes, particularly on the Gold Coast, it will be found, that provision was made for the general peace, and for the safety of indi¬ viduals j even in W.

"W here any of the natives were stolen in order to be v—-> sold to the Europeans, it was done secretly, or at least only connived at by those in power j this appears from Barbot and Bosman’s account of the matter, both a- greeing that man-stealing was not allowed on the Gold Coast. The first says, “ Kidnapping or stealing of human creatures is punished there, and even sometimes with death.” And Bosman, whose long residence on the coast enabled him to speak with certainty, says, “ That the laws were severe against murder, thievery, and adultery $” and adds, “ That man-stealing was pu¬ nished on the Gold Coast with rigid severity, and some¬ times with death itself.” Hence it may be concluded, that the sale of the greatest part of the negroes to the Europeans is supported by violence, in defiance of the laws, though the knavery of their principal men, who (as is too often the case with those in European coun¬ tries), under pretence of encouraging trade, and in¬ creasing the public revenue, disregard the dictates of justice, and trample upon those liberties which they are appointed to preserve",Gold Coast,AU,6,Australia,Oceania

"Some ground having been cleared and cultivated, the governor in the above letter writes, that 27 acres were sown with corn, and that in December the crop was got in : That the corn was exceedingly good} about 200 bushels of wheat and 60 of barley, with a small quantity of flax, Indian corn, and oats; all which is preserved for seed : That if settlers are sent out, and the convicts divided amongst them, this settlement will very shortly maintain itself} but without which this country cannot be cultivated to any advantage. u At present (continues the governor) I have only one per¬ son, who has about 100 convicts under his direction, who is employed in cultivating the ground for the pub¬ lic benefit, and he has returned the quantity of corn above mentioned into the public store : the officers have raised sufficient to support the little stock they have: some ground I have had in cultivation will re¬ turn about 40 bushels of wheat into store ; so that the produce of the labour of the convicts employed in cul¬ tivation has been very short of what might have been expected, and which I take the liberty of pointing out to your lordship in this place } to show as fully as pos¬ sible the state of this colony, and the necessity of the convicts being employed by those who have an interest in their labour.” The, country for 20 miles to the west¬ ward is very capable of cultivation } though the labour of cutting down the trees is very great. At Sydney Cove the stores had been infested by a swarm of rats which destroyed no less than 12,000 lb. weight of flour and rice. The gardens also had suffered very consider¬ ably ; so that, having met with such a considerable loss of 3 H O L [ 569 ] H O L Hoi- of provision, and a sufficient supply not being procured I d. from the Cape, Governor Phillip thought proper to send a further detachment to Norfolk Island, where the fertility of the soil afforded great hopes of their being able in a short time to subsist themselves independent of any assistance from the stores",,"NF,IN",6,"Norfolk Island,India","Oceania,Asia"
"p0, . In the year 1813 a few private individuals made an mei tf the excursion across the Blue mountains, and discovered «olo|. Macquarrie river flowing to the north-west, through a rich, beautiful, undulating country. After a road was made, the governor himself visited this newly disco¬ vered region ; and founded the town of Bathurst on the river, about seventy miles from its source. This new establishment has prospered greatly. The land yields excellent crops $ and the cattle are found to thrive ex¬ tremely. The direction of Macquarrie river away from the nearest sea coast, into the vast interior of the country, gave rise to many speculations j and the Lachlan, another river, having a similar course, was found out shortly after. Two successive expeditions, conducted by Mr Oxley, were fitted out in 1817, to explore the country farther west. The result, however, disappointed the sanguine expectations entertained",Bathurst,AU,6,Australia,Oceania
