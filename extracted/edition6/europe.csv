"Gothofred, Theodore, son of the former, was born at Geneva in 1580. As soon as he had .finished his studies, he went to Paris ; where he conformed to the Romish religion, and applied with indefatigable in¬ dustry to the study of history, that of France particu¬ larly, wherein he became very eminent, as appears by his works. In 1632, the king made him one of his historiographers, with a stipend of 3000 livres ; and, in 1636, he was sent to Cologne, to assist at the treaty of peace negociating there on the part of France, by the cardinal of Lyons. This treaty being removed to Munster, Gothofred was sent thither, where he drew up Memoirs on the subject; and continued in that city, in the king’s service, to his death in 1649. Princi“ pal work is his “ Account of the Ceremonial of the kings of France.” GOTTENBURG, or Gotheburg, a rich and strong town of West Gothland, in Sweden, with a good har¬ bour, at the mouth of the river Gothelba ; which is the best situated for foreign trade of any in Sweden, as it lies without the Sound. It occupies the site of an an¬ cient town, named Lodese, which was built by Gustavus Vasa ; and being endowed with considerable privileges, soon became the great emporium for the trade of the western provinces. Charles IX. when duke of Goth¬ land, having in 1604 laid the foundations of a new town in the island of Hisingen, at no great distance from Lo- dese, called Gotheborg (since corrupted into Gotten- burg'), in honour of his duchy ; upon his accession to the throne, he erected in his new town a trading company ; drew thither many foreigners, particularly the Dutch, to whom he allowed an exemption from all duties of export and import during 20 years; a corps of English and Vol. X. Part I. f GOT Scots troops under the command of William Stewart; Cotten- and granted to the Calvinists established therein the free Q0^tUjng’en< exercise of their religion, the first place in Sweden where this toleration was permitted. Ihe town being in 1611 reduced to ashes by the Danes, was rebuilt in the reign of Gustavus Adolphus in its present situation, and ob¬ tained a confirmation of its ancient rights, with the grant of several additional privileges.—It is built in a very sigular situation. At a small distance from the sea is a marshy plain, scarcely more than half a mile in breadth, watered by the rivers Gotha and Moldal, and almost entirely enclosed with high ridges of rocks, so bare and rugged, that they scarcely produce a single blade of grass, and exhibit as barren an appearance as the summits of the loftiest Alps. Gottenburg stands partly upon the ridges, and partly in the plain ; and is divided from these different situations into the Up¬ per and Lower Town. The latter is entirely level, in- , tersected by several canals in the manner of the Dutch towns; and its houses are all constructed upon piles ; the upper part hangs on the declivities ; and rows of buildings rise one above the other like the seats of an am¬ phitheatre. The whole is regularly fortified ; and its cir¬ cumference is near three miles, exclusive of the suburbs, called Haga, which lie toward the harbour. The streets are all uniformly straight: a few of the houses are of brick ; but the generality are constructed with wood painted red. The harbour is formed by two chains of rocks, and is about a quarter of a mile in breadth. Its entrance is defended by the fort of Newr Elfsborg, which stands upon a small rocky island, and contains a garrison of 250 men. There is at Gotten¬ burg a Royal Society of Sciences and Literature, upon the plan of that of Upsala.—Mr Coxe was informed by a merchant who had resided 22 years at Gottenburg, that, during that period, its population had increased considerably, and that it now contained about 30,000 inhabitants. This flourishing state is attributed to the extension of its commerce, particularly its East India Company, and the success of the herring-fishery. An English consul and several merchants of our nation reside at Gottenburg: and a chapel, with a regular chaplain, is appropriated to their use. E. Long.

"CASES. All nouns (exceptproper names are general terms ; but it is often necessary to use those general terms for the purpose of express!ngparfoe#- lar ideas. This cjan be done only by connecting the general term with some word significant of a quality or circumstance peculiar to the indivi¬ dual intended. When that quality or circumstance is not expressed by an adjective, it is in English and most modern languages eo/n/fto/z/y con¬ nected with the noun by the intervention of o.preposition; but in the Greek and Latin languages the noun has cases to answer the same, and even in English the noun has, besides the nominative, one case to denote possession",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"CONJUNCTIONS-, by which name are distinguished all those CONNECTIVES WHICH ARE COM¬ MONLY EMPLOYED TO CONJOIN SENTENCES. These have been divided into two kinds, called And ‘CONJUNCTIVES, or those words which conjoin sentences and their meanings also 5 and DISJUNCTIVES, or those words which, at the same time that they conjoin sentences, disjoin their meanings. Each of these general divisions has-been again subdivided. The former into copulatives and continuatives, the latter into simple dis¬ junctives and adversative disjunctives. But the general division is absurd, and the subdivisions are useless. Conjunc- <[ tions never disjoin the meanings of sentences, nor have any other effect than to combine two or more simple sentences into one compound sentence. If those simple sentences be oi opposite meanings, before their combination, they will continue so after it, whatever conjunction be employed to unite them. In nature, DIFFERENT TRUTHS are connected, if they be connected at all, by different relations j and therefore when the sentences expressive of those truths are connected jti language, it must be by words significant of those NATURAL relations. Thus, 'Accidental addition is expressed by the conjunction and 5 as when we say, Lysippus was a statuary and Priscian was a grammarian.” "" The unexpected junction of contrary truths is expressed by but j as, “ Brutus was a patriot but Caesar was not.” The relation of an effect to its cause is expressed by because j as, “ Rome was enslaved because Caesar was ambitious.” The relation of an effect to a cause of which the existence is doubtful, by if j as, “ you will live happily if you live honestly.” The relation of a cause to its effect, by therefore j as, “ Caesar was ambitious therefore Rome was enslaved.” The idea of simple diversity is expressed by either and or ; as, “ either it is day or it is night.” Contrariety between two affirmations, which though each may be true by itself, cannot both be true at once, is expressed by unless j as, Troy will be taken unless the Palladium be preserved.” Coincidence of two affirmations apparently contrary to each other is expressed by although j as, “ Troy will be taken although Hector defend it.” PREPOSITIONS, or those connectives of which the common office is to conjoin words which refuse to coalesce j and this they can do only by signifying those relations BY WHICH THE things expressed by the united words are connected in nature. The words of men, like their first ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects j and therefore <! there can be no doubt but the original use of prepositions was to denote the various relations of body. Afterwards when men began to dicern with their intellect, they took those words which they found already made, prepositions as well as others, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual concep- tions. Prepositions therefore are either PROPER, or those which lite¬ rally denote the relations sub¬ sisting among the objects of sense. Such as Or The accidental junction of two things between which there is no necessary connection ; as, “ a house with a party wall.” The separation of two things which we should expect to find united ; as, “ a house without a roof, a man without hands.” The relation subsisting between any thing and that which supports it j as, “ the statue stands upon a pedestal.” The relations of higher and lower j as, “ the sun is risen above the hills To support uneasy steps over the burning marie :—The sun is set BELOW the hori¬ zon :—The shepherd reclines under the shade of a beech-tree.” The relation between any thing in motion and that in which it moves j as, “ the rays of light pass through the air.” The relation between any thing continued, whether motion or rest, and the point of its beginning 5 as, “ the rays of light proceed from the sun:— These figs came from Turkey -That lamp hangs FROM the ceiling.” The relation between any thing continued and the point to which it tends ; as, “ he is going to Italy :—He slept till morning.” The relation between an effect and its cause j as, “ I am sick of my husband and for my gallant.” Conjunctions and preposi¬ tions are indeed employed only to connect sentences and words ; but it may be doubted whether they be parts ofspeech distinct from nouns, verbs, and adjec¬ tives. -See Chap.

"The com- 12. In most languages, probably in all cultivated mon dm- lanmiages, grammarians distinguish the following parts sion of the r ° ‘^1 ’ tw- 1 • 1 nr*' parts of °‘ sPeech '• ry°unt pronoun, verb,participle, adverb, pre- speccli the position, conjunction. The Latin and English gramma- most pro- rians admit the interjection among the parts of speech, Pen although it is confessedly not necessary to the construc¬ tion of the sentence, being only thrown in to express the affection of the speaker : and in the Greek and English tongues there is the article prefixed to nouns, when they signify the common names of things, to point them out, and to show how far their signification extends. In the method of arrangement commonly followed in grammars, adjectives are classed with sub¬ stantives, and both are denominated nouns; but it is cer¬ tain that, when examined philosophically, an essential difference is discovered between the substantive and the adjective; and therefore some writers of eminence, when treating of this subject, have lately given the following classification of words which we shall adopt: The ARTICLE, NOUN, PRONOUN, VERB, PARTICIPLE, ADJEC¬ TIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION, INTER¬ JECTION. All these words are to be found in the En¬ glish language j and therefore we shall examine each 3 class, endeavour to ascertain its precise import, and show Noiln in what respects it differs from every other class. It is < ^ impossible to investigate the principles of grammar without confining the investigation in a great measure to some particular language from which the illustrations must be produced j and that we should prefer the E-ng- lish language for this purpose can excite no wonder, as it is a preference which to every tongue is due from those by whom it is spoken. We trust, however, that the principles which we shall establish will be found to apply universally ; and that our inquiry, though princi¬ pally illustrated from the English language, will be an inquiry into philosophical or universal grammar",Pen,"UK,IN,GR",6,"N/A,India,Greece","N/A,Asia,Europe"
"from one another, without marking either quantity, qua¬ lity, action, or relation. The substantive or noun is the name of the thing spoken of, and in Greek and Latin is called name; for it is wcpa in the one, and nomen in the other-, and if in English we had called it the name rather than the noun, the appellation would per¬ haps have been more proper, as this last word, being used only in grammar, is more liable to be misunder¬ stood than the other, which is in constant and familiar use. That nouns or the names of things must make a part of every language, and that they must have been the words first suggested to the human mind, will not be disputed. Men could not speak of themselves or of any thing else, without having names for themselves and tlie various objects with which they are surrounded",,"GR,UK",6,"Greece,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"te ongin the sin- lar and G R A them therefore to the genus called animal; and this word belongs to every species of animals, and to each individual animal. The same classification is made both of artificial and abstract substances ; of each of which there are genera, species, and individuals. Thus in na¬ tural substances, animal, vegetable, and fossil, denote GENERA 5 man, horse, tree, metal, a SPECIES j and Alex¬ ander,Bucephalus,oak, gold, are individuals. In arti- ficialsubstances,edifice is a GENUS; house, church, tower, are species ; and the Vatican, St Paul's, and the Tower of London, are individuals. In abstract substances, motion and virtue are GENERA flight and temperance are species ; the flight of Mahomet and temperance in wine are individuals. By arranging substances in this manner, and giving a name to each genus and species, the nouns necessary to any language are com¬ paratively few and easily acquired : and when we meet with an object unknown to us, we have only to examine it with attention ; and comparing it with other objects, to refer it to the genus or species which it most nearly resembles. By this contrivance we supply the want of a proper name for the individual; and so far as the resemblance is complete between it and the species to which it is referred, and of which we have given it the name, we may converse and reason about it without danger of error: Whereas had each individual in na¬ ture a distinct and proper name, words would be innu¬ merable and incomprehensible j and to employ our la¬ bours in language, would be as idle as that study of numberless written symbols which has been attributed to the Chinese",London,"VA,GB,CN",6,"Holy See (Vatican City State),United Kingdom,China","N/A,Europe,Asia"
"the individuals but the genera or species into which sub¬ stances are classed j yet, in speaking of these substances, iral num- whether natural, artificial, or abstract, all men must rs’ have occasion to mention sometimes one of a kind, and sometimes more than one. In every.language, there¬ fore, nouns must admit of some variation in their form, to denote unity plurality; and this variation is cal¬ led number. Thus in the English language, when we speak of a single place of habitation, we call it a house ; but if of more, we call them houses. In the first of these cases the noun is said to be in the singular, in the last case it is in the plural, number. Greek nouns have also a dual number to express two individuals, as have likewise some Hebrew nouns ; but this variation is evidently not essential to language j and it is perhaps doubtful whether it ought to be considered as an ele¬ gance or a deformity",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"17. Besides number, another characteristic, visible in of gender substances, is that of SEX. Every substance is either male ax female; or both male and female; or neither one nor the other. So that with respect to sexes and their negation, all substances conceivable are comprehended under this fourfold consideration, which language would be very imperfect if it could not express. Now the existence of hermaphrodites being rare, if not doubtful, and language being framed to answer the ordinary oc¬ casions of life, no provision is made, in any of the tongues with which we are acquainted, for expressing, otherwise than by a name made on purpose, or by a peri¬ phrasis, of sex. Withregardto this great natural characteristic, grammarians have made only a threefold distinction of nouns: those which denote males are said to be of the masculine gender; those which denote females, of the feminine; and those which denote sub¬ stances that admit not of sex, are said to be neuter or of neither gender. All animals have sex j and therefore the names of all animals should have gender. But the sex of all is not equally obvious, nor equally worthy of attention. In those species that are most common, or of which the male and the female are, by their sixe, form, colour, or other outward circumstances, eminently distin¬ guished, the male is sometimes called by one name, which is masculine; and the female by a. difiei'ent name, which is feminine. Thus in English we say, husband, wife ; king, queen; father, mother ; son, daughter, &c. In others of similar distinction, the name of the male is applied to the female only by prefixing a syllable or by altering the termination; as man, woman; lion,lioness; emperor, empress, anciently emperess; master, mistress, anciently masteress, &c. When the sex of any animal is not ob¬ vious, or not material to be known, the same name, in some languages, is applied, without variation, to all the species, and that name is said to be of the common gender. Thus in Latin bos albus is a white ox, and bos alba a white cow. Diminutive insects, though they are doubtless male and female, seem to be considered in the English language as if they were really creep¬ ing things. No man, speaking of a worm, would say he creeps, hut it creeps upon the ground. But although tire origin of genders is thus clear and obvi¬ ous ; yet the English is the only language, with which we are acquainted, that deviates not, except in a very few instances, from the order of nature. Greek and Latin, and many of the modern tongues, have nouns, B 2 some GRAMMAR. Chap. I Noun, some masculine, some feminine, which denote sub* v~*—y—stances where sex never had existence. Nay, some languages are so particularly detective in this respect, as to class every object, inanimate as well as animate, under either t\w, masculine or thefeminine gender, as they have no neuter gender for those which are of neither sex",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"This is the case with the Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish. But the English, strictly following the order ■ of nature, puts every noun which denotes a male ani¬ mal, and no other, in the masculine gender; every name of a female animal, in the feminine; and every animal whose sex is not obvious, or known, as well as every inanimate object whatever, in the neuter gender",,"FR,IT,ES,UK",6,"France,Italy,Spain,N/A","Europe,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"And this gives our language an advantage above most others in the poetical and rhetorical style : for when nouns naturally neuter are converted into masculine and feminine, the personification is more distinctly and more forcibly marked. (See Personification). Some very learned and ingenious men have endeavoured, by what they call a more subtle kind of reasoning, to dis¬ cern even in things without sex a distant analogy to that natural distinction, and to account for the names of inanimate substances being, in Greek and Latin, masculine and feminine. But such speculations are wholly fanciful; and the principles upon which they pro¬ ceed are overturned by an appeal to facts. Many of the substances that, in one language, have masculine names, have in others names that -avgfeminine; which could not be the case were this matter regulated by reason or nature. Indeed for this, as well as many other ano¬ malies in language, no other reason can be assigned than that custom  ^ Quern penes arbitrium est, et jus, et norma, loquendi",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"hap. I* GRAM pose little words, which we have chosen to style par¬ ticles; and in the Greek and Latin languages, the cases cf nouns answer the same end",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"From this idea of the accusative, the reason is obvious why the object after the active verb is often put in that case j it is because the action is supposed to proceed from the agent to the patient. But the same thing happens with respect to the dative case, and for the same reason. Thus, Antonius lev sit Ciceronem, and Anto¬ nias nocuit Ciceroni, are expressions of the same import, and in each the action of hurting is conceived as pro¬ ceeding /row Antony to Cicero j which is finely illu¬ strated by the passive form of such expressions, where the procedure above mentioned is expressly marked by’ the preposition ah': Cicero nocetur, Cicero Iceditur ab An¬ tonio. It is therefore not true, that “ the accusative is that case, at least the otily case, which to an efficient nominative and a verb of action subjoins either the ef¬ fect or the passive subject j nor is the dative the. only case which is formed to express relatiorts tending to itself.” The only thing essential to these two cases is to denote the apposition ox junction of one object with an¬ other ; and this they do nearly, if not altogether, in the same manner, although from the custom of language they may not be indifferently subjoined to the same verb. ^ The Greek language has no ablative case : but in of the ab- the Latin, where it is used, it denotes concomitancy, orlative case, that one thing accompanies another. From this concomi¬ tancy we sometimes draw an inference, and sometimes not. For example, when it is said, Templum clamors petebant, clamour isrepresented concomitant with their going to the temple j and here no inference is drawn: but from the phrase palleo metu, although nothing more is expressed than that paleness is a concomitant of the fear, yet we instantly infer that it is also the effect of it. In most instances where the ablative is used, an inference is drawn, of which the foundation is some natural con¬ nection observed to subsist between the objects thus con¬ nected in language. When this inference is not meant to be drawn, the preposition is commonly added j as, in- Urfectus est cun gladio, “he was slain with a sword about him j” interfectus est gladio, “ he was slain with a sword as the instrument of his death.” 21 The remaining cases, which have not been noticed, Of the no- are the nominative and the vocative. These are in mostniinative instances alike in termination, which makes it probablea.nd v°ca- that they were originally one and the same case. Thetive case?3 foundation of this conjecture will appear from consi¬ dering the use to which each of these cases is applied","Antony, Cicero, Cicero, Of","US,FR,TR",6,"United States,France,Turkey","North America,Europe,Asia"
"20. The Greek and Latin among the ancient, and the German among the modern languages, express dif¬ ferent connections or relations of one thing with another by cases. In English this is done for the most part hy prepositions j hut the English, being derived from the same origin as the German, that is, from the leutomc, lias at least one variation of the substantive to answer the same purpose. For instance, the relation of pos¬ session, or belonging, is often expressed hy a different ending of the substantive, which may be well called a case. This case answers nearly to the genitive case in Latin ; but as that is not a denomination significant of the nature of the case in any language, it may perhaps in English be more properly called t\\e possessive case",,"DE,UK",6,"Germany,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Although the word Godis is as evidently an inflexion of the noun God as the word Dei is an inflexion of Dens, there are grammarians who have denied that in English there is any true inflexion of the original noun, and who have said that the noun with the addition of that syllable, which wre consider as the sign of a case, ceases to be a noun, and becomes a definitive; a word which with them is devoid of signification. Thus, in the expression Alexander’s house, the word Alexander’s stands not as a noun, but as an article or definitive, ser¬ ving to ascertain and point out the individuality of the house. But this is a palpable mistake : the word Alexander’s serves not to point out the individuality of the house, but to show to whom the house belongs; and is therefore beyond dispute, not an article, but a noun, in the possessive case. Again, when we say St Peter’s at Rome and St Paul’s at London, the words St Peter’s and St Paul’s are neither articles, nor, as has been ab¬ surdly imagined, the proper names of edifices, like the liotundo or the Circus ; but they are in the possessive case, the names of the two apostles to whom the churches were dedicated, and to whom they are sup¬ posed to belong","Rome, London","US,GB,UK",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"The two articles differ likewise in this respect, that The dif- as the article A serves only to separate one individualo\i- t’erence Re¬ ject from the general class to which it belongs, it cannot|^ee11 be applied ioplurals. It has indeed the same significa¬ tion nearly with the numerical word one ; and in French and Italian, the same word that denotes unity is also the article of which we now treat. But the essence of the article THE being to define objects, by pointing them out as those of which something is affirmed or denied which is not affirmed or denied of the other objects of the same class, it is equally applicable to both numbers : for things may he predicated of one set of men, as well as of a single man, which cannot be predi¬ cated of other men. The use and import of each article will appear from the following example : “ Man was made for Society, and ought to extend his good-will to all men; but a man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for the men with whom he has the most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with the man whose temper and disposition suit best with his own.” We have said, that the article A cannot be applied to plurals, because it denotes unity : but to this rule there is apparently a remarkable exception in the use of the adjectives Jew and many (the latter chiefly with the word great before it), which, though joined with plural substantives, yet admit of the singular article A : two",Man,"CI,FR,IT",6,"Côte d'Ivoire,France,Italy","Africa,Europe,Europe"
"£4. The indefinite article is much less useful than the other ; and therefore the Greek and Hebrew languages have it not, though they both have a definite article",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"In languages of which the nouns, adjectives, verbs, have inflexion, no mistake can arise from the want ofthe indefinite article $ because it can always be known by the terminations of the noun and the verb, and by the circumstances predicated of the noun, whether a whole species or one individual be intended. But this is not the case in English. In that language, the adjectives having no variation with respect to gender or number, and the tenses of the verbs being for the most part the same in both numbers, it might be often doubtful, had we not the indefinite article, whether the specific name was intended to express the whole species or only one in¬ dividual. Thus, if we say in English, Man was born sent from God,” we must be understood to mean that the birth of every man is from God, because to the specific term the indefinite article is not prefixed. Yet the words Eyenlo uvO^uTrti; uTrirccXpivog ©sov convey no such meaning to any person acquainted with the Greek language ; as the word without any article, is restricted to an individual by its concord with the verb and the participle 5 and the sense of the passage is, A man was born {or existed') sent from God",Man,"UK,CI,GR",6,"N/A,Côte d'Ivoire,Greece","N/A,Africa,Europe"
"But though the Greeks have no article correspondent to the article A, yet nothing can be more nearly rela¬ ted than their 'O to our THE, *0 gsta-^ivt—the king ; —THE gift. In one respect, indeed, the Greek and English articles differ. The former is varied ac¬ cording to the gender and number of the noun with which it is associated, being «—masculine, ij—feminine, to—neuter; and oi, ut,Tx, in the plural number: where¬ as the English article sulFers no change, being invariably THE before nouns ol every gender and in both numbers",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"There are, however, some modern languages which, in imitation of the Greek, admit of a variation of their article which relates to gender 5 but this cannot be considered as essential to this species of words, and it may be questioned whether it be an improvement to the language.. In tongues of which the nouns have no inflexion, it can only serve to perplex and confuse, as it always presents a particular idea of sex where in many cases it is not necessary",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"27. We have said that the article is a part of speech so very necessary, that without it, or some equivalent invention (f), mankind could not communicate their thoughts ; and that of words falling under this descrip- iS tion, we know of no language which is wholly destitute, irticles in w e are aware that these positions may be controvert- ie Latin e(] . an(j tjlat tj)e may be instanced as a language inguage.

That the Latin has been made to serve all these purposes cannot be denied, although Lucretius and Cicero both com¬ plain, that on the subject of philosophy, where the use of articles is most conspicuous, it is a deficient lan¬ guage. But should we grant what cannot be demand¬ ed, that those two great men were unacquainted with the powers of their native tongue, our positions would still remain unshaken j for we deny that the Latin is wholly without articles. It has indeed no word of pre¬ cisely the same import with our THE or the Greek « j but the place of the indefinite article A might be al¬ ways supplied, if necessary, with the numerical word unus. It may be so even in English ; for we believe there is not a single instance where the words one man, one horse, one virtue, might not be substituted for the words a man, a horse, a virtue, &c. without in the slightest degree altering the sense of the passage where such words occur. This substitution, however, can be but very seldom if ever necessary in the Latin tongue, of which the precision is much greater than that of the English would be without articles j because the oblique cases of the Latin nouns, and the inflexion of its verbs, will almost always enable the reader to deter¬ mine whether an appellative represents a whole species or a single individual.—The want of the definite article THE seems to be a greater defect ; yet there are few instances in which its place might not be supplied by this or by that without obscuring the sense; and the Latin tongue is by no means deficient of articles cor¬ responding to these two. Let us substitute the words ONE and that for A and THE in some of the foregoing examples, and we shall find, though the sound may be uncouth, the sense will remain. Thus, “ That man who hath not music in himself, &c","Cicero, Cicero","US,UK,GR",6,"United States,N/A,Greece","North America,N/A,Europe"
"In this passage Hie cannot be a pronoun j for from the beginning of the oration there occurs not a single noun of which it can possibly supply the place. When the orator uttered it, he was probably pointing with his finger at Catiline, and every one of his audience would supply the noun in his own mind, as we do when we translate it, “ Yet this traitor lives.'1'' When Vir¬ gil says, Ille ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena Carmen, it is obvious that he means, I am THAT MAN, or THAT POET, who sung, &.c. ; and though we may translate the words “ I am he who tuned his song,” &c. yet when we construe the passage, we are under the necessity of supplying either vates or vir, which shows that ille is nothing more than a definite article signifying that or THE. It appears then, that the Latin tongue is not wholly destitute of articles, as few cases can occur where the Greek « and our THE may not be supplied by the words Hie and ille j which have in our opinion been very improperly termed pronouns. If there be any such cases, we can only confess that the Latin language is defective y whereas, had it no articles, it is not easy to conceive, how it could answer, to a cultivated people, the ordinary purposes of speech",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"Thus we say—this and that man in the singular, and these and those men in the plural. The Latin articles hie and ille, for such we will call them, are varied like the Greek », not only with the number, but also with the gender of their nouns. In languages, where the structure of a sentence may be so changed from the or¬ der of nature, as it commonly is in Greek and Latin, and where the reader is guided, not by the position but by the terminations of the words, to those which are in concord and those which are not, these variations of the articles have their use $ but in English they are of no Chap. II importance.— Were it not that the custom of the lan- Articles, guage—the forma loquendi, as Horace calls it—has de- * termined otherwise, there would be no more impropriety in saying this, or that men, than in saying some men, or the men. 29 29. As articles are by their nature definitives, it fol- With w]la lows of course, that they cannot be united with such'Y0,ds ar- words as are in their own nature as definite as they may |11(^C|)Seca""' be; nor with such words as, being ^indefinable, cannotm properly be made otherwise; hut only with those words which, though indefinite, are yet capable through the article of becoming definite. Hence the reason why it is absurd to say, the I, or THE Thou •, because nothing, as will be seen afterwards, can make these pronouns more definite than they are of themselves j and the same may he said of proper names. Neither can we say, the Both, because the word Both is in its own nature per¬ fectly defined. Thus if it be said—“ I have read both poets,”—this plainly indicates a definite pair, of whom some mention has been made already. On the con¬ trary, if it be said, “ I have read two poets,” this may mean any pair out of all that ever existed. And hence this numeral being in this sense indefinite (as indeed are all others as well as itself), is forced to assume the article whenever it would become definite. Hence also it is, that as TWO, when taken alone, has reference to same primary and indefinite perception, while the article THE has reference to some perception secondary and definite, it is bad language to say, two THE men, as this would be blending of incompatibles, that is, it would be representing two men as defined and undefined at the same time. On the contrary, to say BOTH THE MEN, is good language j because the substantive cannot possibly be less apt, by being defined, to coalesce with a nume¬ ral adjective which is defined as well as itself. So like¬ wise it is correct to say, THE TWO MEN, THESE TWO MEN, or THOSE TWO MEN j because here the article, being placed at the beginning, extends its power, as well through the numeral adjective as the substantive, and tends equally to define them both",,"GR,UK",6,"Greece,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Such abbreviations are very common. We familiarly say THE SPEAKER, and are understood to mean a high officer in the British parliament j yet, as speaker is a name common to many men, we may, without impro¬ priety, be asked, speaker we mean? and if so, we must reply, the speaker of the house of commons. But that which is eminent is supposed to be generally known •, and therefore, in common language, THE SPEAKER is deemed a sufficient designation of him who presides over the lower house of parliament. Hence, by an easy tran¬ sition, the definite article, from denoting reference,comes to denote eminence also : that is to say, from implying an ordinary pre-acquaintance, to presume a kind ofge- «era/and universal notoriety. Thus A king is any king; hut THE KING is that person whom we acknowledge for our sovereign, the king of Great Britain. In Greek too, as in English, the article is often a mark of emi¬ nence ; for the poet meant Homer, and THE stagy- rite meant Aristotle ; not but that there w re many poets besides Homer, and many Stagyrites besides Aris¬ totle, but none equally illustrious",,"GB,UK",6,"United Kingdom,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"So when one man says to another, with whom he is conversing, “ James did so and so j” it is surely not equivalent to his saying, “ you did so and so.” If such were the case, one might pertinently ask, when both persons are known to each other, Why do they use the personal pronouns ? Mr Harris tells us, that “ when the subject of conversation is the speaker him¬ self he uses I and when it is the party addressed, he uses THOU.” But in fact the nature of the personal pro¬ nouns has no sort of connection with the subject of con¬ versation,whether that conversation relate to the speaker, the party addressed, or a Greek book. In this sentence, ** \isay that the three angles of every triangle are equal to two right angles,” the speaker is surely not the sub- Chap.

Suppose tor example, that we should in history read these words : He caused him to destroy him—and were informed that the pronoun, which is here thrice repeated, stood each time for something different; that is to say, for a man, for a woman, and for a city, whose names were Alex¬ ander, Thais, and Persepolis. Taking the pronoun in this manner—divested of its gender—how would it appear which was destroyed, which the destroyer, and which the cause that moved to the destruction ? But there is no ambiguity when we hear the genders distin¬ guished : when we are told with the proper distinc¬ tions, that SHE caused HIM to destroy IT, we know with certainty, that the prompter was the woman ; that her instrument was the hero; and that the subject of their cruelty was the unfortunate city.—From this exr ample we would be surprised how the Italians, French, and Spaniat'ds, could express themselves with precision or elegance with no more than two variations of this pronoun",,"UK,FR",6,"N/A,France","N/A,Europe"

"he apparent from the following examples. Vir qui sapit, vir sapiens, and vir sapientice; “ a man who is wise, a wise man, and a man of wisdom j” are certainly phrases of the same import.

Thus then it appears, that the relative pronoun contains in itself the force of the prepositive pronoun, together with \\\*K. connection implied in English by the preposition of, and in the ancient languages by the ge¬ nitive case. When one says vir sapit qui pauca loquitur, the relative clause qui pauca loquitur expresses that at¬ tribute of the man from which his wisdom is inferred : it is conceived by the mind, as stript of its propositional form, and standing in the place of a substantive noun governed in the genitive case by vir. The whole sen¬ tence might be thus translated, “ the man of little speaking is wise j” or, did the use of the English lan- guaiie admit of it, “ the man of he speaks little is wise.” In like manner, when it is said, “ Man who is horn of a woman is of few days and full of trouble j”—the re¬ lative clause is equivalent to an abstract noun in the ge¬ nitive case, and the whole might be expressed in the following manner, “ man of he is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.” We are sensible, that these expressions into which, in the instances adduced, we have resolved the relative clauses, will appear extremely uncouth and offensive j hut we mean not to recommend them as common modes of phraseology.

"In English, from the cool and phlegmatic arrange¬ ment of the language, occasioned by the want of in¬ flexions and conjugations, the place of every part of a sentence is almost uniformly determined, and very little variety is allowed in the collocation of the words. The adjective is almost always placed in apposition with its substantive, and the nominative with its verb. In con¬ sequence of this uniformity in the collocation of the words, the mind acquires a habit of connecting in idea any kind of word with the place in which it is used to stand; and is naturally led to consider every wor'd that stands in such a place as belonging tosuch aclass. Hence it is, we imagine, that the definitive that passes into the nature of the relative pronoun ; as in those instances in which it occupies the place of the relative, it was natural to consider it as having the same import. Yet the word that has undoubtedly in itself no more the force of the relative pronoun than the or this, or any other definitive whatever. In such expressions as the foregoing, it is not improbable that originally the clause of the definitive that, which we now call the relative clause, was thrown in as a kind of modifying circumstance in the following manner : “ The book (I read that) is elegant j” where the speaker, finding the word book too general for his purpose, throws in a clause to qualify and restrict it, or to confine his affir¬ mation to that particular book which he is then read¬ ing. We can easily suppose, that through time the definitive that in such an expression might be transpo¬ sed or removed from its own place to that of the rela¬ tive: so that the expression would run thus, “ The book that I read is elegant which would be considered as precisely equivalent to “ The book which I read is ele¬ gant.” This opinion is not a little confirmed by a similar use of the article in Greek, which though un¬ doubtedly a definitive like the English the, is often used instead of the relative pronoun. Numberless examples may be found in Homer and Herodotus, especially in the latter, who seldom uses what is properly called the rela¬ tive. We shall produce one instance from each",,"GR,UK",6,"Greece,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"“ That is, “ He who steals my purse, &c. •,” “ Which he who would learn, as soon, &c.}” and “ Ille qui Bavium non odit, &c. Such abbreviations occasion no obscurity, because from previous circumstances the hearer knows the mind of the speaker and the persons to whom he refers. But it is not with respect to the relative and antecedent only that such abbreviations have place : in sentences of a different form, whole clauses are sometimes omitted, while the meaning of the speaker is made sufficiently plain. Thus when King Richard III. having lost his horse in battle, exclaims, “ A horse ! a horse ! my kingdom for a horse !” there is no complete thought expressed ; but the circum¬ stances in which the king then was, enabled those about him to understand that hz wanted ahorse. Accordingly Catesby answers him, “ Withdraw, my lord, I’ll help you to a horse.” In like manner, when a person asks a question, his expression is frequently incompletej but the tone of his voice, or some other circumstance, enables us to ascer¬ tain his meaning, and to supply, if we please, the words that are omitted. Thus when it is said, Anfecistif nothing more is expressed than If you did it (the Latin an being nothing else but the Greek xi, 5/) ; but some circumstance enables the person who hears it to know that the meaning is, “ Say if you did it.” Let us apply these observations to the words who and which",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

"If we join two prcctcr-imperjects together, the expres¬ sion will state the co-existence of two progressive ac¬ tions, both of which were going on at a. time past in re¬ spect of some determinate time given or supposed. “ Cum tu scribebas ego legebam 5” ” when you were writing I was reading.” Hence the prteter-imperfect has by some grammarians been called the relative present ; a name which, however, is by no means exclusively appli¬ cable to this tense. WThen theprceter-imperfect is by the conjunction and joined in the same sentence with a plusquam perfect, the two tenses express two actions, both prior to the time of speaking y but the one as having continued after the other was finished.

The prceter-pcrfect in that language sustains a twofold character : it performs the office of the Greek and English aorist, as well as of the preeter- perfect properly so called ; that is, it denotes a finished action at some indefinite past time, as well as at some time which is both past and definite","Troy, Of","GR,UK,US,TR",6,"Greece,N/A,United States,Turkey","Europe,N/A,North America,Asia"
"In attempting to analyze the signification o( complea terms, by which we here mean words that include in their signification a variety of particulars, it is of great advantage to have these particulars separately expressed by different words in another language. Now the Eng¬ lish has resolved the tenses, which in the Greek and Latin languages are denominated the aorist and the preeter-perfect, by means of what are commonly called auxiliary verbs, expressing the former by the verb did, and the latter by the verb have. In examining there¬ fore GRAMMAR",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"But the aorist, which signifies no such possession, is as constantly joined with a portion of past time which ex¬ cludes the present now or instant. Thus we say, “ I have written a letter this day, this week,” &c. $ but, “ I wrote a letter yesterday, last week,” &c.; and to interchange these expressions of time in Greek and Eng¬ lish, where the aorist and preeter-perfect have different forms, would be improper. In Latin, indeed, where they have but one form, the impropriety does not appear",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"In Latin and English there are two tenses for this pur¬ pose *, of which the first represents an action in point of time as not yet existing, but as about to exist at some pe¬ riod to come; but it does not bring the completion of the action into view. The other asserts the futurity of an action together with its completion. Scribam, “ I shall be writing,” denotes future time and complete action; for it does not say whether I am to write for a long or for a short time, or whether I shall finish what I pro¬ mised to begin. This part of the verb, therefore, to which the Greek corresponds, is an imperfect future, and likewise an aorist. The futurity of any action, it should seem, may always be computed from the time of speaking; for every action must be future with respect to the time at which its futurity is declared; but the time of its futurity may be more precisely specified by fixing on some other future time to which to refer it: “ I shall be writing after he shall have departed.” Shall or will refers to future time indefinitely; and write or writing refers to an action which is indeed to begin and so far to proceed, but of which nothing is said concerning the completion",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"Secondly, The present of the subjunctive is used to de¬ note (r) On this point we subscribe to the opinion of the elegant and ingenious Dr Beattie.—“It will perhaps occur (says he), that there are two Greek tenses, of which I have given no account; namely, the second aorist, and the second future. The truth is, that I consider them as unnecessary. Their place, for any thing 1 know to the contrary, might at all times he supplied by the first aorist axu] the first future. Some grammarians are of opinion, thatthe first aorist signifies time past in general, and ihe second, indefinite time/m*,* and that the first future Aexiotes a nearer, and the second, a more remote futurity. But this, I apprehend, is mere conjecture, unsupported by proof: and therefore I incline rather to the sentiments of those who teach, that the second future and the second aorist have no meaning different from the first future and the first aorist; and that they are the present and. imperfect of some obsolete theme of the verb ; and when the other theme came into use, happened to be retained for the sake of variety perhaps, or by accident, with a preterite and future signification. Be this as it will, as these tenses are peculiar to the Greek, and have nothing corresponding to them in other tongues, we need not scruple to overlook them as superfluous.”—The Theory of Language, Part II. Chap. ii",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"To these judicious observations we have nothing to add, but that they acquire no small degree of confirma¬ tion from this circumstance, that there are many Greek verbs which have no second future, and which are yet employed to denote every possible modification of future time.

The affirmation, however, alone is essential to the verb, for the attribute may be expressed by other words. It is indeed extremely probable, that, in the earliest ages of the world, the affir¬ mation and attribute were always expressed by different words ; and that afterwards, for the sake of conciseness, one word, compounded perhaps of these two, was made ta express both the affirmation and the attribute : hence arose the various classes of verbs, active, passive, and neuter. Of a process of this kind there are evident signs in the Greek and some other tongues. But the improvers of language stopped not here. The same love of con¬ ciseness induced them to modify the compound verb itself, that it might express various combinations of thought still more complex : but in all these combinations assertion was of necessity included j for if the word had ceased to assert, it would have ceased to be a verb of any kind",Of,"TR,GR",6,"Turkey,Greece","Asia,Europe"
"which would soon he contracted into lion sleeps, stands, runs, bites, hurts, &c.

It may be true, that to the infinitive exclusively we should turn our attention, when we wish to ascertain the accident denoted hy % particular verb or class of verbs ; i. e. the kind of action, passion, or state of being, of which, superadded to affirmation, that verb or class of verbs is expressive: but in accidents of this kind it may be doubted if there be any thing that with propriety ca-u be said to be common to all verbs. There seems indeed to be nothing common to all verbs but that which is essential to them, and by which they are distinguished from every other part of speech j but every kind of action, passion, and state of being, may be completely expressed hy participles and abstract nouns ; and therefore in such accidents we cannot find the essence of the verb, because such accidents distinguish it not from other parts of speech. Were a man called upon to specify the essence of verse ov metre, he would not say, that it consists in the meaning of the words, or in the using of these words according to the rules of syntax. In every kind of verse where words are used they have indeed a meaning, and in all good verses they are grammatically constructed ; but this is likewise the case in prose, and therefore it cannot be the essence of verse. The essence of verse must con¬ sist in something which is not to be found in prose, viz. a certain harmonic succession of sounds and num¬ ber of syllables: and the essence of the verb must likewise consist in something which is not to be found in any vther part of speech ; and that, we are persuaded, is nothing but affirmation. But if affirmation be the very essence of tha verb, it would surely be improper, when we endeavour to ascertain the general import of that part of speech, to turn our thoughts exclusively to a word which implies no affirmation j for what does not affirm, cannot in strictness of truth be either a verb or the mode of a verb",Edinburgh,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

It is acknowledged by I)r Beattie, that this, which we have taken, is the most convenient light in which the participle can be considered in universal gram- mart and yet he affirms that present participles do not always express present time, nor preterite participles past time; nay, ih&iparticiples have often no connection with time at all. He thus exemplifies his assertion, in Greek, in Latin, and in English",,"GR,UK",6,"Greece,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Of the truth of his assertion respecting past participles, he gives a Greek and a Latin example. The former is taken from St Mark : 0 Tnnvtrxs <rwl)no-{]xi; and the /aMer is that which is commonly called the perfect future of the passive verb amor, amatus fuero. In the first in¬ stance, be says that the participle, though belonging to the aorist of the past time, must be rendered either by the indefinite present, “ be who believeth ;"" or by the future, “ he who to///believe and the reason which he gives for this rendering of the word is, that “ the be¬ lieving here spoken of is considered as posterior in time to the enunciation oi the promise."" This is indeed true, but it is not to the purpose; for with the enunciation of the promise, the time of the participle has no manner of concern. The time of TrufUvrxi depends entirely upon the time of vu^a-irxi, with respect to which it must undeniably he past. Our Lord is not here asserting, that he who shall believe at the day of final retribution, shall be saved; but that be who shall on that day be found to have believed in time past, shall be saved : and if the participle had not been expressive of n.finished action and a past time, the whole sentence would have convey¬ ed a meaning not friendly to the interests of the gospel",Of,"TR,GR",6,"Turkey,Greece","Asia,Europe"
"88. It has been already observed, and must be obvi¬ ous to all, that substances alone are susceptible of sex ; and that therefore substantive nouns alone should have distinctions respecting gcWcr. The same is true with respect to number and person. An attribute admits Adjectives of no change in its nature, whether it belong to you from their or to ME, to a MAN or a WOMAN, to ONE man or to h{lye MANY j and therefore the worr/s expressive aiattributes, ]lo varia_ ought on all occasions, and in every situation, to be fix- tjon to ,je_ ed and invariable. For as the qualities good and note sex, black and white, are the same, whether they be applied numb<ir> or to a man or a woman, to manij or to few ; so the wordl,en,0lu which expresses any one of these attributes ought in strictness to admit of no alteration with whatever sub¬ stantive it may be joined. Such is the order of nature 5 and that order, on this as on other occasions, the Eng¬ lish language most strictly observes : for we say equally, a good man or a good woman ; good men or good wo¬ men ; a good house or good houses. In some languages, indeed, such as Greek and Latin, of which the nouns admit of cases, and the sentences of an inverted struc¬ ture, it has been found necessary to endow adjectives with the threefold distinction of gender, number, and person ; but as this is only an accidental variation, oc¬ casioned by particular circumstances, and not in the least essential to language, it belongs not to our subject, but to the particular grammars of these tongues. ^ There is, however, one variation of the adjective, They have which has place in all languages, is founded in the nature however of things, and properly belongs to universal grammar",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"sentence Socrates is evidently compared with the Athe- A(jVf nians, and Homer with all other poets. Again, if it be & said that Socrates was more wise than any other Athe- ''“""""v nian, but that Solomon was the most wise of men ; is not a comparison of Solomon with mankind in general, as plainly implied in the last clause of the sentence, as a com¬ parison oi Socrates with the other Athenians in the first? But if both imply comparison, it may be asked, In what consists the difference between the comparative and su¬ perlative? Does the superlative always express a greater excess than the comparative? No: for though Socrates was the most wise of the Athenians, yet is Solomon af¬ firmed to have been more wise than he $ so that here a higher superiority is denoted by the comparative more than by the superlative most. Is this then the diflerence between these, two degrees, that the superlative implies a comparison of one with many, while the comparative implies only a comparison of one with one? No : this is not always the case neither. The Psalmist says, that “ he is wiser (or more wise) than all his teachers j” where, though the comparative is used, there is a com¬ parison of one with many. The real diflerence between these two degrees of comparison may be explained thus : When we use the superlative, it is in consequence of having compared individuals with the species 10 which they belong, or one or more species with the un¬ der which they are comprehended. Thus, Socrates was the most wise of the Athenians, and the Athenians were the most enlightened of ancient nations. In the first clause of this sentence, Socrates, although compared with the Athenians, is at the same time considered as one of them ; and in the last, the Athenians, although compared with ancient nations, are yet considered as one of those nations. Hence it is that in English the superlative is followed by the preposition of and in Greek and Latin by the genitive case of the plural number; to show, that the object which has the pre¬ eminence is considered as belonging to that class of things with which it is compared",,"UK,GR",6,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"
"92. We have hitherto considered comparatives as ex¬ pressed by the words more and most; but the authors, or improvers of language, have contrived a method to retrench the use of these adverbs, by expressing their force by an inflection of the adjective. Thus, instead of morefair, they say FAIRER ; instead of most fair, FAIR¬ EST : and the same method of comparison takes place both in the Greek and Latin languages*, with this dif¬ ference, however, between the genius of these langua¬ ges and ours, that we are at liberty to form the com¬ parison either in the one method or in the other J whereas in those languages the comparison is seldom if ever formed by the assistance of the adverb, but always by the inflection of the adjective. Hence this inflection is by the Greek and Latin grammarians considered as a necessary accident of the adjective ; but it has reached no farther than to adjectives, and participles sharing t/ie nature of adjectives. The attributes expressed by verbs are as susceptible of comparison as those expressed by adjectives ; but they are always compared by means of adverbs, the verb being too much diversified already to admit of more variations without perplexity",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"compared as of the same class ; and when we use the comparative, as of different classes $ yet is not this distinction always attended to by the best writers in any language.

"98. Most writers on grammar have mentioned a species of adverbs, which they call adverbs of interroga¬ tion, such as where; whence, whither, how, &c. But the truth is, that there is no part of speech, which, of itself, denotes interrogation. A question is never ask¬ ed otherwise than by abbreviation, by a single word, whether that word be a noun, & pronoun, a verb, or an adverb. The word WHERE is equivalent to-—in what place ; WHENCE to—from what place; and HOW to—in what manner, &c. In these phrases, IN what place, FROM what place, and IN what manner, the only word that can be supposed to have the force of an interroga¬ tive, is what, which is resolvable into that which; But we have already explained, in the chapter of Pro«o«»s, the principles upon which the relative is made to denote interrogation, and the same reasoning will account for the adverbs where, whence, whither, how, &c. being employed as interrogatives. When we say, where were you yesterday? whence have you come? whither are you going? how do you perform your journey ? We merely use so many abbreviations for the following sentences ; tell us, or describe to us, THE place where (or in which) you were yesterday; the pj.ace ivhencc (or from which) you have come ; the place to which you are going; THE manner in which you perform your journey? And so much for adverbs.

"If this derivation of the word but from botan, to superadd, be just, the sentence in the text, “ the number^, three is not an even number BUT an odd,” will be equivalent to, “ the number three is not an even number, superadd (it is) an odd number j” and if so, the opposition is not marked (at least directly) by the word Bur, but by the adjectives EVEN and ODD, which denote attributes in their own nature opposite. It is only when BUT has this sense that it answers to sed in Latin, or to mais in French. In the second line of the quotation from Gawin Douglass’s Preface, the word BUT is evidently a contraction of BE-UTAN, and has a sense very differ¬ ent from that of bot in the preceding line. The meaning of the couplet is, “ SuPERADD (to something said or supposed to be said before) thy work shall endure in laude and glorie, BE out (i. e. without) spot or fault, &c.

"That Mr Tooke's principles will apply exactly to the conjunctions of every language both dead and living, is what onr limited knowledge of these languages does not authorise us positively to affirm. It is, however, a strong presumption in favour of his opinion, that illite¬ rate savages, the first cultivators of language, are little likely to have sent out their faculties in quest of words to denote the abstract relations subsisting among their ideas, when we have such evidence as his book affords that the names of the most common substances and quali¬ ties could answer that and every other purpose, which in the ordina-y intercourse of life can be answered by the faculty of speech. It is a farther presumption in his favour, well as the manner in which the place of these words is supplied in the languages which have not a conjunction cor¬ respondent to them, strongly justify his derivation which we have adopted.

"107. Mr Harris is of opinion that most, if not all, prepositions (u) This account of prepositions is taken from Horne Tooke, who adds, that the only difference between the two words WITH and JOIN, is, that the other parts of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon verb W1THAN, to join (of which with is the imperative), have ceased to be employed in the language. As with meansjWw, so the cor¬ respondent French preposition AVEC means, and have that, or, have that also. But though WITH, as the impe¬ rative of Withan, means^om, it has sometimes a very different signification. Mr Tyrwhit in his Glossary has truly observed, that with and by are often synonymous. They certainly are so j but then WITH seems to be an abbreviation of the imperative of WYRTHAN, to be; as WITHOUT is of WYRTHAN-UTAN, to be out. This being the case, our two instances in the text will stand thus : a house join a party-wall; a house by.-out a roof. Nor let any one be surprised that we make no difference between the conjunction without and the preposition WITH¬ OUT. The word is the same, whether it be employed to unite words or sentences. Prepositions were originally, and for a long time, classed with conjunctions ; and when first separated from them, they were only distinguished by the name o[ prepositive conjunctions. They are generally used to unite words, but not always ; for we may say indifferently, / came after his departure, or 1 came after HE departed. By the greater part of gram¬ marians, indeed, AFTER, when employed as in the first sentence, is classed with the prepositions ; when em¬ ployed as in the second, it is classed with the conjunctions. The word, however, is the same in both sentences j its meaning is the same, and its effect precisely the same. The only circumstance of discrimination is, that in the first example it is prefixed to a noun, his departure ; in the second, it is prefixed to a nominative and a verb, he departed. But even the nominative and the verb, thus applied, express no more than a specifying circum¬ stance annexed to the other proposition, I came ; and whenever they are rightly apprehended by the mind, they are stript of their prepositionary form, and considered abstractly under a new phasis, his departure. Thus, then, the two sentences are synonymous in every respect, excepting the apparent grammatical nature of the words his departure, and he departed; and even these are reduced to one grammatic form in the mind, whenever the im¬ port of tire propositions is rightly apprehended. Without, and many other prepositions, especially in the learn¬ ed languages, are used exactly as AFTER is used in the two instances which we have given. Horne Tooke quotes Lord Mansfield for saying, “ It cannot be read WITHOUT the Attorney-General consents to it.” This, in mo¬ dern English, is not the common phraseology, but it offends not against any principle of grammar. The nomi¬ native and the verb are here, as in the former instance, considered as an abstract noun. “ It cannot be read WITHOUT the consent of the Attorney-General.” (x) ’Ihorourh, thourough, thorow, through, or thro’, is no other, says Horne Tooke, than the Gothic substantive Dauro, or the Teutonic substantive THURUH, and, like them, means door, gate, passage. So that the sentence in the text, resolved upon his principles, stands thus : “ The splendid sun—JOIN his beams—genially warmeth passage the air, (or, the air being the passage or medium)—the fertile earth.” And in the same mannei may we translate the preposition through in every instance where through is used in English, or its equi¬ valent preposition in any language ; as from the Latin and Italian word porta (in Spanish puerta and in French portej, have come the Latin and Italian preposition per, the French por, and the Spanish por, (y) If, for instance, we were to substitute with or of instead of through, we should in the 1 Vol. X.

"(b) Up, UPON, OVER, ROVE, ABOVE, have all, says Horne Tooke, one common origin and signification. In the Anglo-Saxon, UFA, UFERA, ufeMjEST, are the adjectives altus, ALTIOR, altissimus. Ufa or UFAN, up; comparative UFERA, ofere or ofer, over or upper ; superlative UFEMA£ST, utmost or uppermost. Beufan, BUFAN, ON BUFaN, bove, above. If this be a just account of the origin of these words, the sentences in the text, where upon, over, and above, occur, will run thus: “ The statue stood ON HIGH a pedestal j” “ the river ran HIGHER a sand j “ the sun is risen ON HIGH the hills.” And here we may observe, that the mere relation be¬ tween standing, running, &c. and place, is rather inferred from the verb itself than expressed by a separate word; and the reason is obvious. For if a statue stand, every one knows that it must stand on some thing as well as at some time. There is therefore no necessity, whatever elegance there may he in it, for employing any word to denote that relation, which is commonly believed to be signified by on ; but it is necessary to insert, be¬ tween the verb and pedestal, a word significant oiplace, that pedestal may not be mistaken, by an ignorant per¬ son, for a portion of time, or any thing else connected with the standing of the statue",Ufa,RU,6,Russian Federation,Europe
"(c) That TO is significant oi detached relation, is the language of Mr Harris, which, though it may be al¬ lowed in a loose and vulgar sense, is certainly not philosophically just.

"it is obvious, that what is done, is terminated, ended, finished. In the Teutonic, this verb is written TUAN or TUON- whence the modern German THUN, and its preposition TU. In the Anglo-Saxon, the verb is TEOGAN, and the preposition TO. Do, the auxiliary verb, as it has been called, is derived from the same root, and is in¬ deed the same word as TO. The difference between a T and a D is so very small, that an etymologist knows by the scarce tongue. The preposition . . _ _ _ # employed as a Latin substantive. He exhibits the derivation of AD thus : {AGDUM AGD AD or or or ACTUM —ACT AT The most superficial reader of Latin verse (he observes), knows how readily the Romans dropped their final urn",,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"And a little consideration of the organs and practice of speech will convince him how easily AGD or act would become ad or at •, as indeed this preposition was indifferently written either way by the ancients. By the later writers of Rome, the preposition was written AD with D only, in order to distinguish it from the other corrupt word called the conjunction at ; which for the same reason was written with the T only, though that likewise had anciently been written, as the preposition, either AD or AT. The preposition TO and the conjunction too in Eng¬ lish, are both in syntax and in meaning used exactly as the preposition AD and the conjunction AT in Latin. From tiie specimens prefixed to Johnson’s dictionary, as a history of our language, it appears that, as late as the reign of Elizabeth, the preposition and conjunction were both written with one O. And it has been shown in the first vo¬ lume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that TO and TOO, as well as AD and AT, are precisely of the same import. The only difference, in either language, between the preposition and the conjunction, is, that the former directs, as a modification of some previous proposition, the addition ot some substantive or noun ; the latter, sometimes a sentence or clause of a sentence considered abstractly as a noun ; and that, when the former h used, the preposition, to which the modifying circumstance is to be added, \s formally expressed, hot omitted when the latter is employed. Thus Denham says, “ Wisdom he has, and, to his wisdom courage ; “ Temper TO that, and, UNTO all, success.” In this example, every succeeding circumstance is by the preposition TO marked as an addition to the preceding","Rome, Johnson, Elizabeth, Edinburgh","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"So too w^e say, with thought j without attention j think¬ ing over a subject g under anxiety ',from fear j through jealousy, &c. All which instances, with many others of like kind, show, that the first words of men, like Uplzxxfirst ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects; and that in after days, when they began to discern with their intellect, they took those words which they if a man should utter a sentence, and to the end of it subjoin the very general word do, the person to whom he spoke, would naturally ask, do what ? and this question would, of course, produce an additionalsfatcact or clause of a sentence. Besides, it is to be observed, that AGERE, from which the Latin preposition is derived, as well as the Gothic verb, which is the source of the English particles, means not only TO DO, but also to adduce or bring; so that when we say, Im is going to Italy,” we do nothing more than affirm that “ he is going,"" and desire the person to whom we speak, “ to ADD Italy, to the journey.” From this derivation of the preposition to, it will be seen at once upon what principle it is employed to mark the infinitive mode. In the learned languages that mode is generally known by its termination $ but in English it would be impossible, without the aid of to or of some other word significant of action, to distinguish the VERB love from the noun or substantive",,"IT,UK",6,"Italy,N/A","Europe,N/A"

It is therefore a matter of perfect indif¬ ference to the sense, whether we say sickness of hunger, or sickness for hunger ; The man, OF he speaks little, is wise, or the man is wise, for he speaks little. By means of the preposition OF, we declare sickness to be the CON¬ SEQUENCE proceeding from hunger, and wisdom to he the CONSEQUENCE we infer from the man's speaking little ; by means of FOR, we declare hunger to he the CAUSE of sickness, and the circumstance of speaking little to be the cause from which we infer the man's wisdom. In the one sentence, of is to be considered as nnoun in apposi¬ tion to sickness; in the other, as a noun in apposition to the man is wise taken abstractly as a noun. In the one sentence for (i.e. cause) is to be considered as a noun in apposition to hunger; in the other, as the same noun in apposition to he speaks little taken abstractly as a noun, j,, 109. In the foregoing use of prepositions, we havePrepoii- seen how they are applied by way of juxta-position that is to say, where they are prefixed to a word with-^|“^ c out becoming a part of it. But they are used also pother way of composition; that is, they are prefixed to other words, words so as to become real parts of them. Thus in Greek we have iTruflettrixi; in Latin intelligere; and in Enlish UNDERstand. So also, to FOREtel, or ovERact, to UNDERvalue, to ouTgo, &c.; and in Greek and Latin other instances innumerable. In this case the preposi¬ tions commonly transfuse something of their own mean¬ ing into the word with which they are compounded. 1^2 For example, if we suppose some given space, E and EX transfuse signify out of that space ; PER, through it; in, within zV; something SURunderit. Hence E and per, in composition, augment:of thci1- Enormis is something not simply big, but big in excess i^g'jnto something got out of the rule, and beyond the measure",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"(g) Junius derives for from the Greek ?r§s ; Skinner, from the Latin but I believe, says Horne Tooke, that it is no other than the Gothic substantive Fairina, “ cause.” He imagines also that OF (in the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon af) is a fragment of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon words AFARA and AFORA, posteritas, proles, &c. In a word, he considers FOR and OF as nouns or substantives ; the former always meaning cause, the latter always meaning consequence, offspring, successor, follower, &c. If this account of these words be just, and we have no doubt of it, the prepositions for and OF are in syntax to be considered as nouns in apposition with other nouns, or with sentences taken abstractly as nouns» 62 G K A M M A R",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

"The Moors have left more monuments in Granada than in any other city in Spain. From the great num¬ ber of inscriptions in and about the city, and the fine edifices of the Alhambra and the Generalif, it might be supposed these people intended to make Granada the greatest depository of their religion, manners, cu¬ stoms, and magnificence. There is not a wall which does not bear some marks of their power $ but, not¬ withstanding this abundance of monuments, the reign of the Moors in Spain is still buried in confusion and obscurity. The ignorance of the Spaniards, their su¬ perstition, and the hatred they bore the Moors, have much contributed to this darkness-, they have either destroyed, or suffered to be eftaced by time, every thing which bore the mark of Mahometanism, instead of preserving the monuments of antiquity, which at the same time were those of their own glory j and it may be said, that chance alone, and the solidity of their con¬ struction, much more than curiosity or a love of the arts, has preserved those which still exist, though daily going to ruin. - An account of the Alhambra has been already gi¬ ven under its name in the order of the alphabet. From the hall of Comares there mentioned, there is a modern little staircase the old one, which corresponded to the beauty of the edifice, having been destroyed. At the top of the staircase is a gallery, a part of which is in¬ closed with an iron railing : this kind of cage is called the prison of the queen. It was here the wife of the last king of Granada was imprisoned. The Gomels and Legris, two families of distinction, bore false wit¬ ness against her virtue, and occasioned the destruc¬ tion of the greatest part of the Abencerrages, another 64 ] G R A powerful and numerous family of Granada of whom they were jealous. The history of this event is given as follows : In the year 1491, Abdali, surnamed the Little, still reigned in Granada j but this city was upon the brink of ruin, for the principal families were divided against each other. The Moors had carried their arms against Jaen, and had been bravely repulsed. Abdali was con¬ soling himself in one of his pleasure houses for the ill success of his enterprise, when the Zegris, who long had been the secret enemies of the Abencerrages, took the opportunity of this defeat to represent them to the king as rebellious subjects, who employed their immense riches to gain the favour of the people and dethrone their sovereign. They accused Albin Ha- met, the most rich and powerful among them, of ha¬ ving an adulterous commerce with the queen, and pro¬ duced witnesses who asserted they had on a certain fe¬ stival seen, at Generalif, under a bower of rose trees, Albin Hamet in the arms of that princess. The fury of Abdali may easily be imagined j he swore the de¬ struction of the Abencerrages. But the Zegris, too prudent to let his anger break forth, advised him to dissimulate, and not to suffer it to be known to that numerous and powerful family that he was informed of their perfidy. It will be better, said they, to entice them into the snare, and, before they can unite and put themselves into a state of defence, revenge upon their heads the insult offered to the crown. This ad¬ vice was followed ; Abdali went to the Alhambra, having ordered thirty of his guards to arm themselves, and the executioner to attend. The Abencerrages were sent for one by one, and beheaded as soon as they entered the hall of the lions, where there is still a large vase of alabaster,"" which was quickly filled with blood and the heads of expiring bodies. Thirty-five heads had already been struck off, and all the Abencerrages would have died in the same manner, had not a page, who had followed his master, and remained unpercei¬ ved in the hurry of the execution, taken an opportu¬ nity of withdrawing and giving information to the rest of the unhappy family of what had passed. These im¬ mediately assembled their friends in arms, crying out through the city of Granada, “ Treason ! treason ! Let the king die ! he unjustly puts to death the Aben¬ cerrages ! ’ The people, with whom they were favou¬ rites, did not hesitate in assisting them : fourteen thou¬ sand men were soon found in arms, and immediately proceeded towards the Alhambra, shouting all the ™ay> L,et ^ie k*ng die ! Abdali, surprised his secret should have been so soon discovered, and severely re¬ penting of having followed the pernicious counsels he had received, ordered the castle gates to be shut; but they were presently set on fire. Muley Hacen, who had ieen forced to abdicate the throne in favour of his son, hearing the tumult of the people, had one gate open¬ ed and presented himself to appease the rage of the citizeno j but he no sooner appeared, than he was lift- ‘^B1! bu he m.U!tltude ncarest gate, who cried out, Behotd our king, we will have no other, long live “neJ Ha?nA IeavinS llira surroundedSby a te.edgHS d,il he AbenCe,?a£es’ and other fiobles, en- drlT th1e,.castle’ accoi«Pan‘ed by upwards of an hun¬ dred soldiers.

"But a humbling image is not always necessary to produce that effect: a remark is made above, that in describing superior beings, the reader’s imagination, unable to support itself in a strained elevation, falls often as from a height, and sinks even below its ordi¬ nary tone, The following instance comes luckily in view j for a better cannot be given : “ God said, Let there be light, and there was light.” Longinus quotes this passage from Moses as a shining example of the sublime 5 and it is scarce possible, in fewer words, to convey so clear an image of the infinite power of the JDeity : hut then it belongs to the pre¬ sent subject to remark, that the emotion of sublimity raised by this image is hut momentary $ and that the mind, unable to support itself in an elevation so much above nature, immediately sinks down into humility and veneration for a Being so far exalted above grovelling mortals. Every one is acquainted with a dispute about that passage between two French critics *, the one po-# ^ sitively affirming it to be sublime, the other as posi-andft lively denying. What has been remarked, shows, that botli of them have reached the truth, but neither of them the whole truth : the primary effect of the pas¬ sage is undoubtedly an emotion of grandeur ; which so far justifies Boileau : but then every one must he sensible, that the motion is merely a flash, which, va¬ nishing instantaneously, gives way to humility and ve¬ neration. That indirect effect of sublimity justifies Eluet, on the other hand, who being a man of true piety, and probably not much carried by imagina¬ tion, felt the humbling passions more sensibly than his antagonist did. And laying aside difference of character, Huet’s opinion may perhaps be defended as the more solid; because, in such images, the depressing emotions are the more sensibly felt, and have the longer endurance*. i The straining an elevated subject beyond due bounds, p8ife and beyond the reach of an ordinary conception, islime not a vice so frequent as to require the correction of criticism. But false sublime is a rock that writers of more fire than judgment commonly split on ; and therefore a collection of examples may be of use as a beacon to future adventurers. One species of false su¬ blime, known by tire name of bombast, is common among writers of a mean genius ; it is a serious endeavour, by strained description, to raise a.low or familiar subject above its rank ; which, instead of being sublime, fails not to be ridiculous.

"GRAN1CUS, a small river near the Hellespont in Lesser Asia, remarkable for the first victory gained by Alexander the Great over the armies of Darius.— Authors disagree very much about the number of the Persians, though all agree that they were vastly more numerous than the Greeks. Justin and Orosius tell us, that the Persian army consisted of 600,000 foot and 20,000 horse j Arian makes the foot amount to 200,000 ; but Diodorus tells us, that they were not more than 100,000 foot and 10,000 horse. The Ma¬ cedonian army did not exceed 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. The Persian cavalry lined the banks ol the Granicus, in order to oppose Alexander wherever he should attempt a passage and the foot were posted be¬ hind the cavalry on an easy ascent. Parmenio would have had Alexander to allow his troops some time to refresh themselves ; but he replied, that after having crossed the Hellespont, it would be a disgrace to him and his troops to be stopped by a rivulet. Accor¬ dingly a proper place for crossing the river was no sooner found, than he commanded a strong detach¬ ment of horse to enter j he himself followed with the right wing, which he commanded in person j the trum¬ pets in the mean time sounding, and loud shouts of joy being heard through the whole army. The Persians let fly such showers of arrows against the detachment of Macedonian horse as caused some confusion $ several of their horses being killed or wounded. As they drew near the bank a most bloody engagement ensued ; the Macedonians attempting to land, and the Persians pushing them back into the river. Alexander, who observed the confusion they were in, took the com¬ mand of them himself j and landing in spite of all op¬ position, obliged the Persian cavalry, after an obstinate K 2 resistance, Granieu* G R A [76 resistance, to give ground* However, Spithrobates, (governor of Ionia* and son-in-law to Darius, still main- Giant. tained his ground, and did all that lay in his power  v Iji’ing them hack to the charge* Alexander ad¬ vanced full gallop to engage him j neither did he de¬ cline the combat, and both were slightly wounded at the first encounter. Spithrobates having thrown his javelin without effect, advanced sword in hand to meet his antagonist, who ran him through with his pike as he raised his arm to discharge a blow with his sci¬ mitar. But Rosaces, brother to Spithrobates, at the same time gave Alexander such a furious blow on the head with his battle-axe, that he beat off his plume, and slightly wounded him through the helmet. As he was ready to repeat the blow, Clitus W'ith one stroke of his scimitar cut oft Ilosaces’s head, and thus in all probability saved the life of his sovereign. The Macedonians then, animated by the example of their king, attacked the Persians with new vigour, who soon after betook themselves to flight. Alexander did not pursue them*, hut immediately charged the enemy’s foot with all his forces, who had now passed the river. The Persians, disheartened at the defeat of their cavalry*, made no great resistance. The Greek merce¬ naries retired in good order to a neighbouring hill, whence they sent deputies to Alexander, desiring leave to march off unmolested. But he, instead of coming to a parley with them, rushed furiously into the middle of this small body, where his horse was killed under him, and he himself in great danger of being cut in pieces",,MK,6,North Macedonia,Europe

He had so high an idea of the dignity of his profession, that he held it equally criminal to neglect any honest means of coming at justice, or to make use of any arts to elude it.

This prevailed more espe¬ cially after it was found that few of his sentences were reversed *, and when they were, it was commonly owing to himself: for if, upon mature reflection, or upon new reasons offered at the re-hearing, he saw any just ground for altering his judgment, he made no scruple of de¬ claring it ; being persuaded that it was more manly, as well as more just, to follow truth, than to support opi¬ nion : and his conduct in this respect had a right effect|j for instead of lessening, it raised his reputation. He would not, however, with all this great stock of know¬ ledge, experience, and probity, trust himself on matters of blood, or venture to decide in criminal cases on the lives of his fefjow-creatures j which was the reason that, though often solicited, he could never be prevail¬ ed upon to accept of a seat in the justiciary court.— In his private character he was as amiable as he was respectable in his public. He was charitable without ostentation, disinterested in his friendships, and bene¬ ficent to all who had any thing to do with him. He was not only strictly just, but so free from any species of avarice, that his lady, who was a woman of great prudence and discretion, finding him more intent on the business committed to him by others than on his own, took upon herself the care of placing out his mo- 5 ney y G R A ' [ 77 ] G R A ant ney ; anti to prevent his postponing, as he was apt to C uviile. do, such kind of affairs, when securities offered, she y—' caused the circumstances of them to be stated in the form of cases, and so procured his opinion upon Ills own concerns as if they had been those of a client. He was so true a lover of learning, and was so much ad¬ dicted to his studies, that, notwithstanding the multi¬ plicity of his business while at the bar, and his great attention to his charge when a judge, he nevertheless found time to write various treatises on very different and important subjects : Some political, which were remarkably well timed, and highly serviceable to the government: others of a most extensive nature, such as his essays on law, religion, and education, which were dedicated to George II. when prince of Wales; by whose command, his then secretary, Mr Samuel Mo- lyneaux, wrote him a letter of thanks, in which were many gracious expressions, as well in relation to the piece as to its author. He composed, besides these, many discourses on literary subjects, for the exercise of bis own thoughts, and for the better discovery of truth: which went no farther than his own closet, and from a principle of modesty were not communicated even to his most intimate friends.” GRANTHAM, a town of Lincolnshire, no miles N. from London, situated on the river Witham.

"—Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant, descend¬ ed of a noble family in Italy, had gained a plentiful fortune, of which he was liberal-handed to all in ne¬ cessity ; which being well known to others, though concealed by himself, a young stranger applied to him for charity. Signior Frescobald, seeing something in his countenance more than ordinary, overlooked his tat¬ tered clothes; and compassionating his circumstances, asked him “ What he was, and of what country.’* “ I am (answered the young man) a native of Eng¬ land ; my name is Thomas Cromwell, and my father- in-law is a poor sheer-man. I left my country to seek my fortune ; came with the French army that were routed at Gatylion, where I was a page to a footman, and carried his pike and burgonet after him.” Fres¬ cobald commiserating his necessities, and having a particular respect for the English nation, clothed him genteelly ; took him into his house till he had recover¬ ed strength by better diet; and, at his taking leave, mounted him upon a good horse, with 16 ducats of gold in his pockets. Cromwell expressed his thank¬ fulness in a very sensible manner, and returned by land towards England ; where, being arrived, he was pre¬ ferred into the service of Cardinal Wolsey. After the cardinal’s death, he worked himself so effectually into the favour of King Henry VIII, that his majesty made him a baron, viscount, earl of Essex, and at last made him lord high chancellor of England. In the mean time, Signior Frescobald, by repeated losses at sea and land, was reduced to poverty ; and calling to mind (without ever thinking of Cromwell), that some Eng¬ lish merchants were indebted to him in the sum of 15,000 ducats, he came to Eondon to procure payment",Essex,"IT,US,FR,UK",6,"Italy,United States,France,N/A","Europe,North America,Europe,N/A"
"Travelling in pursuit of this affair, he fortunately met with the lord chancellor as he was riding to court; who thinking him to be the same gentleman that had done him such great kindness in Italy, he immediately alighted, embraced him, and with tears of joy asked him, “ If he was not Signior Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant?” “ Yes, Sir (said he) and your most humble servant.” “ My servant! (said the chan¬ cellor) No ; you are my special friend, that relieved me in G Pv A ' L 79 ] G P A e. in my wants, laid the foundation of my greatness, and, as such, I receive you j and, since the afiairs of my so¬ vereign will not now permit a longer conference, I beg you will oblige me this day with your company at my house to dinner with me.” Signior Frescobsld was surprised and astonished with admiration who this great man should be that acknowledged such obligations, and so passionately expressed a kindness tor him j but, con¬ templating a while his voice, his mien, and carriage, he concludes it to be Cromwell, whom he had relieved at Florence j and therefore not a little overjoyed, fjoes to his house, and attended his coming. His lordship came soon after j and immediately taking his friend by the hand, turns to the lord high admiral and other no¬ blemen in his company, saying, “ Don’t your lordships wonder that I am so glad to see this gentleman ? This is he who first contributed to my advancement.” He then told them the whole story y and holding him still by the hand, led him into the dining-room, and placed him next himself at table. The company being gone, the chancellor made use of this opportunity to know what affair had brought him into England* Frescobald in few words gave him the true state of his circumstan¬ ces : To which Cromwell replied, “ I am sorry for your misfortunes, and I will make them as easy to you as I can y but, because men ought to be just before they are kind, it is fit I should repay the debt I owe you.” Then leading him into his closet, he locked the door; and opening a coffer, first took out 16 ducats, delivering them to Frescobald, and said, “ My friend, here is the money you lent me at Florence, with ten pieces you laid out lor my apparel, and ten more you laid out for my horse; hut, considering you are a mer¬ chant, and might have made some advantage of this money in the way of trade, take these four bass, in every one of which is 400 ducats, and enjoy them as the free gift of your friend.” These the modesty of Frescobald would have refused, but the other forced them upon him. He next caused him to give him the names of all his debtors, and the sums they owed : which account he transmitted to one of his servants, with a charge to find out the men, and oblige them to pay him in 15 days under the penalty of his displea¬ sure ; and the servant so well discharged his duty, that in a short time the entire sum was paid. All this time Signior Frescobald lodged in the chancellor’s house, where he was entertained according to his merits, with repeated persuasions for his continuance in England, and an offer of the loan of 60,000 ducats for four years if he would trade here : but he desired to return to Florence, which he did, with extraordinary favours from the lord Cromwell","Florence, Florence, Florence","US,IT",6,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"

"GRAVESANDE, William James, was born of an ancient and honourable family at Delft in Holland, in 1688. He studied the civil law at Leyden, but which situation he cultivated an acquaintance with learned men 5 with a society of whom, he published a periodical review entitled Le Journal Literaire, which was continued without interruption from the year 1713 to the year 1722, when he died. The most consider¬ able of his works are, “ A treatise on perspective ; An introduction to the Newtonian philosophy, or a treatise on the elements of physics confirmed by experiments $ A treatise on the elements of algebra, for the use of young students j” and “ A course of logic and meta¬ physics.” He had intended to have presented the pub¬ lic with a system of morality, but his death prevented the execution. The ministers of the republic consulted him on all occasions wherein his talents were requisite ; and his skill in calculation was often of service to them ; as was his address in deciphering, for detecting the secret correspondence of their enemies.

"GRAVESEND, a town of Kent in England, si¬ tuated on the banks of the Thames. It is 25 miles from London j and has a blockhouse well mounted with cannon, to command the ships and river, di¬ rectly opposite to Tilbury fort in Essex. The town was plundered and burnt by the French and Spaniards in the reign of Richard II. to compensate which, the king, at the request of the abbot of St Mary-le- Grace of Tower-hill, to whom he had granted a ma¬ nor there called Parrocks, vested it and Milton with the sole privilege of carrying passengers by water from hence to London at 4s. the whole fare, or 2d. a- head ; which was confirmed by Henry VIII. •, but now the fare is 9d. a-head in the tilt-boat, and is. in the wherry. The former must not take in above forty passengers, the latter no more than eight. Coaches ply here at the landing of people from London, &c. to carry them to Rochester. This town and Milton were incorporated by Queen Elizabeth by the name of the portreeve, (now the mavor), jurats, and inhabitants of Gravesend and Milton : And as Gravesend is the place where most passengers through Kent from foreign parts take boat for London, that queen, in order to show the grandeur of the metropolis of her kingdom, order¬ ed the lord mayor, aldermen, and city companies, to receive all ambassadors and eminent strangers here in their formalities, and to attend them to London in barges if by water; or if they chose to come by land, they rvere to meet them on horseback on Black- heath in their livery gowns. The towns for several miles round are supplied from hence with garden stuffs; of which great quantities are also sent to London, where the asparagus of Gravesend is preferred to that of Battersea. All outward-bound ships are obliged to anchor in this road till they have been visited by the customhouse officers; and for this purpose a centinel at the blockhouse fires a musket: but the homeward- bound all pass by without notice, unless it be to put waiters on board, if they are not supplied before.

"He was educated at Eton, where he contracted a friend¬ ship with Mr Horace Walpole, and with Mr Richard West son of the lord chancellor of Ireland. Mr West and Mr Gray were both intended for the bar: but the former died early in life, and the latter was diverted from that pursuit by an invitation to accompany Mr Walpole in his travels ; which he accepted without any determined plan for his future life. During Mr Gray’s travels, he Wrote a variety of letters to Mr West and to his parents, which are printed with his poems ; and when he returned, finding himself in narrow circum¬ stances, yet with a mind indisposed for active employ¬ ment, he retired to Cambridge, and devoted himself to study. Soon after his return, his friend West died ; and the melancholy impressed on him by this event may be traced in his admired “ Elegy written in a country churchyard j” which is thought to have been begun, if not finished, at this time ; though the conclusion, as it stands at present, is certainly different from what it was in the first manuscript copy. The first impulse ot his sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender sonnet in English, on the Petrarchian model j and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexame¬ ters, written in the genuine strain of classical majesty, with which he intended to begin one of his books De Principiis Cogitandi",Cambridge,"IE,US,UK",6,"Ireland,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"From July 1759 to the year 1762, he generally re- Ij sided G R A [ 82 ] G R A Gray, sided in London, with a view, as we have already ob- v~'—•• served, of having recourse to the British Museum. In July 1786, his grace the duke of Grafton wrote him a polite letter, informing him, that his majesty had been pleased to offer to him the professorship ol Mo¬ dern History in the university of Cambridge, then va¬ cant by the death of Mr Laurence Brocket. This place was valuable in itself, the salary being 400I. a year "", but what rendered it particularly acceptable to Mr Gray was its being given him without any solici¬ tation. He was indeed remarkably disinterested in all his pursuits. Though his income, before this addi¬ tion, was very small, he never read or wrote with a view of making his labours useful to himself. He may be said to have been of those few personages in the annals of literature, especially in the poetical class, who are devoid of self-interest, and at the same time attentive to economy $ and also was among mankind in general one of those very few economists, who pos¬ sess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain of avarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in private charity, as would have done credit to an ampler purse. But what chiefly deterred him from seeking any advantage by his lite¬ rary pursuits, was a certain degree of pride, which led him to despise the idea of being thought an author by profession","London, Grafton, Cambridge","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"However, it is probable, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of Strabo } for his papers contain a great number of notes and geo¬ graphical disquisitions on that author, particularly with respect to that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he has left upon almost every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that philosopher than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncom¬ mon labour was the Anthologia. In an interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has tran¬ scribed several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading ; has inserted a great number of cri¬ tical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, is uncertain. The only work which he meditated upon with this direct view from the be¬ ginning was a history of English poetry, upon a plan sketched out by Mr Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to those three fine imita¬ tions of Norse and Welsh poetry, which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems. But after he had made some considerable preparations for the exe¬ cution of this design, and Mr Mason had offered him his assistance, he was informed, that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relin¬ quished, by mutual consent; and soon after, on that gentleman’s desiring a sight of the plan, our author readily sent him a copy of it","Asia, Plato, Oxford","IN,PH,CO,US,GR,UK,GB",6,"India,Philippines,Colombia,United States,Greece,N/A,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,South America,North America,Europe,N/A,Europe"
"Among other sciences, Mr Gray had acquired a great knowledge of Gothic architecture. He had seen and accurately studied in his youth, while abroad, the Roman proportions on the spot, both in ancient times, and in the works of Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to consider those stupendous structures Gray, of more modern date that adorn our own country ; -yX which, if they have not the same grace, have undoubt¬ edly equal dignity. He. endeavoured to trace this mode of building from the time it commenced through its various changes, till it arrived at its perfection in the reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Eliza¬ beth. For this purpose, he did not so much depend upon written accounts, as that internal evidence which the buildings themselves give of their respective anti¬ quity ; since they constantly furnish to the well-inform¬ ed eye, arms, ornaments, and other marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he applied himself to the study of heraldry as a prepa¬ ratory science j and has left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove him a complete master of it. By these means he arrived at so very extraordinary a pitch of sagacity, as to be en¬ abled to pronounce, at first sight, on the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected. But the favourite study of Mr Gray for the last ten years of his life was natural history, which he then rather resumed than began j as by the instruc¬ tions of his uncle Antrobus, he was a considerable bo¬ tanist at 15. The marginal notes which he has left on Linnaeus and other writers on the vegetable, animal, and fossil kingdoms, are very numerous; but the most considerable are on Hudson’s Flora Anglica, and the tenth edition of the Systema Nature ; which latter he interleaved and filled almost entirely. While employ¬ ed on zoology, he read Aristotle’s treatise on that sub¬ ject with great care, and explained many difficult pas¬ sages of that obscure ancient by the lights he had re¬ ceived from modern naturalists. In a word, excepting pure mathematics, and the studies dependent on that science, there was hardly any part of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill, and in most of them a consummate mastery. To this account of his literary character we may add, that he had a fine taste in painting, prints, gardening, and music j and was moreover a man of good breeding, virtue, and hu¬ manity","Roman, Hudson","RO,US",6,"Romania,United States","Europe,North America"
"He died in 1771 : and an edition of his poems, with memoirs of his life and writings, were published in 4to, in 1775, by Mr Mason. This gentleman, however, instead of employing his own pen in drawing Mr Gray’s character, has adopted one drawn by the reverend Mr Temple, rector of Mamhead in Devonshire, in a letter to Mr Bpswellj to whom the public are indebted for com¬ municating it. “ Perhaps (says Mr Temple) he was the most learned man in Europe. He was equally acquaint¬ ed with the elegant and profound parts of science, and that not superficially but thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both natural and civil y had read all the original historians of England, France, and Italy : and was a great antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics, morals, politics, made a principal part of his plan oi study y voyages and travels of all sorts were his favour¬ ite amusement y and he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and gai'dening. With such a fund of knowledge, his conversation must have been equally instructing and entertaining j but he was also a good man, a well-bred man, a man of virtue and hu¬ manity. There is no character without some speck, some.imperfection j and I think the greatest defect in G R E [ 83 ] G R E , a_ his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather effeminacy, | and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and disdain of C ives. his inferiors in science. He also had, in some degree,   ’ that weakness which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve: though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters; and though without birth, or for¬ tune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who read for his amuse¬ ment. Perhaps it may be said, What signifies so much knowledge, when it produces so little ? Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems? But let it be considered, that Mr Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed ; to him¬ self, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably ; he was every day making some new acquisition in science ; his mind was enlarged, his heart softened, and his virtue strengthened ; the world and mankind were shown to him without a mask ; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and unworthy the at¬ tention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knorv- ledge, and the practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us.” GRAYLING.

He was educated at Baliol College in Oxford, from which he removed to Merton. He was after¬ wards, on the foot of his great merit, chosen geo¬ metry professor of Gresham college His ardent thirst of knowledge soon carried him into several parts of Greaves Europe, where he eagerly seized every opportunity of II improving it. His next voyage was into the eastern Greece, countries ; where nothing remarkable in the heavens, "" * earth, or ^n subterraneous places, seems to have escaped his nice observation. He, with indefatigable industry, and even at the peril of his life, collected a considerable number of Arabic, Persic, and Greek manuscripts, for Archbishop Laud. Of these he well knew the value, as he was a master of the languages in which they were written. He also collected for that prelate many oriental gems and coins.

"The general names by which the inhabitants of this country were known to the ancients were those of Graioi, or Graicoi, from whence the name of Greece is plainly derived. These names are thought to come from Graecus, the father, or (according to some) the son, of Thessalus, who gave name to Thessaly; but some mo¬ dern critics choose to derive it from Ragau, the same with Peu, the son of Peleg, by the transposition of a letter to soften the sound.—-These names were after¬ wards changed for Achau'and Hellenes; the first, as is supposed from Achceus, the son of Xuthus, the son of Hellen, and father of Ion ; or, according to the fable, the son of Jupiter: the other from Hellen, above men¬ tioned, the son of Deucalion, and father of Dorus, from whom came the Dores, afterwards a famous na¬ tion among the Greeks. Another name by which the Greeks were known in some parts of the country, was that of Pelasgi, which the Arcadians, the most ancient people in Greece, deduced from their pretended foun¬ der Pelasgus, who is said to have got such footing in Peloponnesus, that the whole peninsula from him was called Pelasgia. But the most ancient name of all is universally allowed to have been that of lones, which the Greeks themselves derived from Ion the son of L 2 Xuthus ; G R E [ 84 ] G R E reecc. Xntlius •, or, as the fable hath it, of Apollo, by Cre- usa the daughter of Erichtheus the grandson of Deu¬ calion. Josephus, however, afiirm'*, that their origi¬ nal is of much older date; and that Javan, the son of Japhet, and grandson ot Noah, was the first who peopled these countries ; which Bochart hath also ren¬ dered very probable. It is true, indeed, that among the Greeks themselves, only the Athenians, and such colonies as sprung from them, were called Zones : but it is also plain beyond exception, that other nations sgave this name to all the inhabitants of Greece, The inhabitants of Greece in the first ages, even by the confession of their own historians, appear to have been savages scarce a degree removed from brutes",Jupiter,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"They lived indifferently on every fruit, herb, or root that came in their way : and lay either in the open fields, or at best sheltered themselves in dens, caves, and hollow trees: the country itself in the mean time remaining one continued uncultivated desert. The first improvement they made in their way of living, was the exchanging of their old food for the more whole¬ some acorns, building huts for themselves to sleep in, and covering their bodies with the skins of beasts. For all this, it seems, they were beholden to Pelasgus a- bove mentioned (supposed by some to be Peleg spoken of in Scripture), and who was highly reverenced by them on that account.—This reformation in their way of life, however, it seems, wrought none in their man¬ ners. On the contrary, they who had nothing to fight for but a hole to sleep in, began now to envy and rob one another of these slender acquisitions. This, in process of time, put them under a necessity of joining themselves into companies under some head, that they might either more safely plunder their neighbours, or preserve what they had got. Laws they had none, except that of the sword : so that those only lived in safety who inhabited the most barren and craggy pla¬ ces ; and hence Greece for a long time had no settled inhabitants, the weakest being always turned out by the strongest. Their gigantic size and strength, if we may believe Plutarch, added so much to their insolence and cruelty, that they seemed to glory in committing the greatest acts of violence and barbarity on those that unhappily fell into their hands",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"The next advance towards civilization, was their forming themselves into regular societies, to cultivate the lands, and build themselves towns and cities for their safety. Their original barbarity and mutual vio¬ lences against each other naturally prevented them from uniting as one nation, or even into any considerable community : and hence the great number of states in¬ to which Greece wTas originally divided. The most remarkable of these small principalities mentioned in history are the following : In Peloponnesus were those of Sicyon, Argos, and Messenia, Achaia Propria, Arcadia, and Laconia. In Grsecia Propria, (that part of Greece which lay without Peloponnesus,) were those of Attica, Megara, Boeotia, Lucris, Epichne- midia, Doris, Phocis, Locris, Ozolaea, and Ailtolia","Arcadia, Laconia","GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"In Epirus were the Molossi, Amphilochi, Cassiopaei, Drceopes, Chances, Thesprotii, Almtni, and Acar- nani. In Thessaly were those of Thessaliotis, Esti- otis, Pelasgiotis, Magnesia and Phthia.—-All these have at one time or other been severally governed by kings of their own, though we only find the names of many of them mentioned in the histories of the more GrefCf considerable kingdoms of Sparta, Attica, Thebes, &c.—-The erection of these kingdoms, however, for some time, did not much alter the case ; the inhabi¬ tants of the new kingdoms plundered and destroyed one another without mercy. Attica was the only place in any degree free from these incursions, because it was naturally destitute of every thing that could in¬ vite a plundering enemy ; but those cities fared much worse which were situated on the sea-coasts; because they were in continual danger of being plundered ei¬ ther by sea or land : for pirates at that time did not less infest all those seas than robbers did the land. And this was one main cause why most of the ancient cities of Greece were situated at some considerable distance from the shore ; but even in these, as all their fafety consisted in the resistance they could make against an invader, their inhabitants were under the necessity of going constantly armed, and being ever on their guard",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"During this period of savage barbarity, the most renowned Grecian heroes, as Hercules, Theseus, &c, performed their exploits ; which, however exaggera¬ ted by poetic fiction, no doubt had a foundation in truth. Some indeed are of opinion that the Grecian- heroes are entirely fictitious, and their exploits de¬ rived from those of the Hebrew worthies, such as Sam¬ son, Gideon, &c. Yet, considering the extreme de¬ gree of barbarity which at that time prevailed through¬ out Greece, it seems not at all improbable that some persons of extraordinary strength and courage might undertake the cause of the oppressed, and travel about like the more modern knights-errant in quest of adven¬ tures",Hercules,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"The first expedition in which we find the Greeks united, was that against Troy, the particulars of which are recited under the article Troy. Their success here (which happened about 1184 B. C.) cost them very dear ; vast numbers of their bravest warriors be¬ ing slain ; great numbers of the survivors being cast away in their return ; and many of those who had the good luck to get back again being soon after mur¬ dered, or driven out of their country. It is probable, however, that their having staid for such a long time in Asia, might contribute to civilize the Greeks some¬ what sooner than what they otherwise would lia%-e been ; and accordingly, from this time, we find theis history somewhat less obscure, and as it were begin¬ ning to emerge out of darkness. The continual wars, indeed, in which they were engaged among themselves, no doubt, for a long time, prevented them from ma¬ king any considerable advances in those arts in which they afterwards made so great progress. These wars, which G R E L 85 J G R E ,e which indeed never ceased as long as the Greeks pre- w served their liberty, rendered them brave, and skilled in the military art above all other nations j but at the same time they effectually prevented them from making permanent conquests, and confined them within the bounds of their own country j while the different states were one way or other so equally balanced, that scarce one of them was able perfectly to subdue another. The Spartans, however, having with great difficulty, re¬ duced the kingdom of Messene, and added its terri¬ tories to their own, became the leading people in Greece. Their superiority was long disputed by A- thens 5 but the Peloponnesian war at last determined that point in favour of the Spartans, when the city of Athens was taken, and its walls demolished by Ly- sander the Spartan general. See Attica, N° 164","Troy, Troy, Asia, Athens","US,GR,PH",6,"United States,Greece,Philippines","North America,Europe,Asia"
"— By the battle of Leuctra, the Spartans lost that superiority which they had maintained for 500 years, and which now devolved on the Thebans. After the death of Epaminondas, the celebrated Theban gene¬ ral, however, as no person was found possessed of his abilities, the Thebans were again obliged to yield the superioritv to the Spartans. But by this time the Greeks had become acquainted with the luxuries and elegancies of life*, and all the rigour of their ori¬ ginal laws could not prevent them from valuing these as highly as other people. This did not indeed abate their valour, but it heightened their mutual animosi¬ ties, at the same time that, for the sake of a more easy and comfortable life, they became more disposed to submit to a master. The Persians, whose power they had long dreaded, and who were unable to resist them by force of arms, at last found out (by the advice of Alcibiades) the proper method of reducing the Gre¬ cian power J namely, by assisting them by turns, and supplying one state with money to fight against another till they should be all so much reduced, that they might become an easy prey. Thus the Greeks were weakened, though the Persians did not reap any bene¬ fit from their weakness. Philip of Macedon entered into the same political views*, and partly by intrigue, partly by force, got himself declared generalissi¬ mo of Greece. His successor Alexander the Great completed their subjection ; and by destroying the ci¬ ty of Thebes, and exterminating its inhabitants, struck such a terrror throughout Greece, that he was as fully obeyed by all the states as by any of the rest of his subjects. During his absence in Persia, however, they attempted to shake off the Macedonian yoke, but were quelled by his general Antipater. The news of Alexander’s death was to them a matter of the utmost joy; but their mutual animosities prevented them from joining in any solid plan for the recovery of their liberties, and hence they continued to he oppressed by Alexander’s successors, or other tyrants, till Aratus, an Achaean, about 268 B. C. formed a design of set¬ ting his country free from these oppressors. He per¬ suaded a number of the small republics to enter into a league for their own defence, which was called the Achcean league $ and notwithstanding that the repub¬ lics, taken singly, bad very little strength, they not only maintained their independency, but soon became formidable when united. This association continued to become daily more and more powerful; but received a severe check from Cleomenes, king of Sparta, which obliged them to call in Antigonus to their assistance, Greece",,"GR,MK",6,"Greece,North Macedonia","Europe,Europe"
"This, by a proper union among themselves, they might have accomplished : but in this they acted as though they had been infatuated ; receiving with the utmost joy the decree of the Roman consul, who declared them free ; without considering, that he who had thus given them liberty, might take it away at his pleasure",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"This lesson, however, they were soon taught, by the total reduction of their country to a Roman province j yet this scarce can be called a misfortune, when we look back to their history, and consider their outra¬ ges upon one another: nor can we sympathize with them for the loss of that liberty which they only made use of to fill their country with slaughter and blood¬ shed. After their conquest by the Romans, they made no united effort to recover their liberty. They continued in quiet subjection till the beginning of the 15th century. About that time they began to suffer under the tyranny of the l urks, and their sufferings were completed by the taking of Constantinople in I453* Since that time they have groaned under the yoke of a most despotic government j so that all traces of their former valour, ingenuity, and learning, are now in a manner totally extinct",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"Modern Greece comprehends Macedonia; Albania, now called Arnaut; Epirus; Thessaly, now Jana; A- chaia, now Livadia; the Peloponnesus, now Morea; together with the islands on its coast, and in the Archi¬ pelago. The continent of Greece is seated betwixt the 36th and 43d degrees of north latitude; and be¬ tween the 19th and 23th degrees of longitude, east of London. To the north, it is bounded by Bulga¬ ria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains ; to the south by the Mediterranean sea ; to the east by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the west by the Adriatic or gulf of Venice. Its length is said to be about 450 miles, and its utmost breadth about 335 miles. The air is extremely tem¬ perate and healthy : and the soil fruitful, though bad¬ ly cultivated ; yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and venison. As to re¬ ligion, Christianity was planted in Greece soon after the death of our Saviour, and flourished there for many ages in great purity; but since the Greeks became subject to the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into the most deplorable ignorance, in consequence of the slavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their re¬ ligion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and absur¬ dities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Constantinople ; who is chosen by the neighbouring archbishops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a person of great dig¬ nity, being the head and director of the eastern church- The G R E [ 86 ] G R E Greece. The other patriarchs are those of Jerusalem, Antioch, —-v——' and Alexandria. Mr Tournefort tells us, that the pa¬ triarchates are now generally set to sale, and bestowed upon those who are the highest bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, are always cho¬ sen from among the Caloyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a vest of linsey-woolsey, or some other stuff, presented by the grand signior to ambassadors, and other persons newly invested with some considerable dignity, they are obliged to make large presents to the vizir, &c. The income of the patriarch of Constantinople is said to amount to no less than one hundred and twenty thou¬ sand guilders, of which he pays the one-half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman Porte, adding six thousand guilders besides as a present at the feast of Bairam. The next person to a bishop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then come the abbot, the arch-priest, the priest, the dea¬ con, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lectu¬ rer. The secular clergy are subjected to no rules, and never rise higher than high-priest. They are allowed to marry once $ but it must be with a virgin, and be¬ fore they are ordained. They have neither glebe nor tythes, but depend upon the perquisites that arise from their office ; and they seldom preach but in Lent","London, Venice, Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria","GR,US,MK,AL,RO,GB,IL,TR",6,"Greece,United States,North Macedonia,Albania,Romania,United Kingdom,Israel,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia,Asia"
"Their fasts are very severe. They believe also in the doctrine of transubstantiation, and that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son. They admit not of purgatory, says Mr Thevenot: but yet they allow a third place, where they say the blessed re¬ main, in expectation of the day of judgment. At mass they consecrate with leavened bread j and com¬ municate under both kinds, as well laics as priests, and as well women and children as men. When they carry the sacrament to the sick, they do not pro¬ strate themselves before it, nor expose it to be adored : neither do they carry it in procession, or have any particular feast in honour of it. Baptism is perform¬ ed among them by plunging the whole body of the child thrice into water. Immediately after baptism, they give it confirmation and the communion j and seven days after that, it undergoes the ceremony of ablution. When a priest is married, among other ce¬ remonies, the bridegroom and bride drink each two glasses of wine $ then the glass is given to the priest, who merrily drinks off the rest of the wine, and break¬ ing the glass, says, So may the bridegroom break the virginity of the bride. As to the character of the modern Greeks, they are said to be very covetous, hy¬ pocritical, treacherous, great pederasts, and at the same time revengeful to the highest degree; but very superstitious. They are so much despised by the Turks, that these do not value even a Greek who turns Ma¬ hometan. The Turks are remarkable for their taci¬ turnity ; they never use any unnecessary words; but the Greeks, on the contrary, are very talkative and 3 lively. The Turks generally practise what their re- Gl.{e[f ligion enjoins, but the Greeks do not; and their mi- Greel,, sery puts them upon a thousand mean shifts and scan- ’""■—v-s dalous practices, authorised by bad example, and per¬ petuated from father to son. The Greek women have fine features and beautiful complexions: their coun¬ tenances still very much resemble those of the ancient Greek statues. See Greece, Supplement",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

"When any new invention, instrument, machine, or the like, is discovered, recourse is generally had to the Greek for a name to it; the facility wherewith words are there compounded, affording such as will be ex¬ pressive of its,use: such are, barometer, hygrometer, microscope, telescope, thermometer, &c. But of all sciences, medicine most abounds with such terms; as diaphoretic, diagnosis, diarrhoea, hsemorrhagy, hydro¬ phobia, phthisis, atrophy, &c. Besides the copious¬ ness and significancy of the Greek, wherein it excels most, if not all, other languages, it has also three num¬ bers, viz. a singular, dual, and plural: also abundance of tenses in its verbs, which makes a variety in dis¬ course, prevents a certain dryness that always accom¬ panies too great an uniformity, and renders that lan¬ guage peculiarly proper for all kinds of verse. The use of the participles, of the aorist and preterite, toge¬ ther with the compound words already mentioned, give it a peculiar force and brevity, without taking any thing from its perspicuity,",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"It is no easy matter to assign the precise difference between the modern and ancient Greek; which con¬ sists in the terminations of the nouns, pronouns, verbs, Stc, not unlike what obtains between some of the di¬ alects of the Italian or Spanish.

"The principal river, called Baal, falls into the sea in Ac«< the 64th degree of latitude, where the first Danish lodge ^ was built in 1721 j and has been navigated above 40 miles up the country. , West Greenland was first peopled by Europeans inPeopWI the eighth century. At that time a company of Ice-aeotaj landers, headed by one Ericke Rande, were by accident^1"" driven on that coast. On his return he represented the1 country in such a favourable light, that some families again followed him thither, where they soon became a thriving colony, and bestowed on their new habitation the name of Greenland or Greenland, on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to Christianity by a missionary from Norway, sent thither by the celebrated Olaf, the first Norwegian monarch who embraced the true religion. The Greenland set¬ tlement continued to increase and thrive under his pro¬ tection j and in a little time the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bishops, &c. un¬ der the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Drontheim. A considerable commerce was carried on between Green¬ land and Norway ; and a regular intercourse maintain¬ ed between the two countries till the year 1406, when j the last bishop was sent over. From that time all cor-AlIc® ^ respondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Green-SP°^(1 tore, land has been buried in oblivion. ,'crt This strange and abrupt cessation of all trade and0g-' ^ intercourse has been attributed to various causes; but the most probable is the following : The colony, from its first settlement, had been harassed by the natives, a barbarous and savage people, agreeing in customs, garb, language, and appearance, with the Esquimaux found about Hudson’s bay. This nation, called Schrellings, at length prevailed against the Iceland settlers who inhabited the western district, and exterminated them ^ in the 14th century : insomuch, that when their brethren cc]0!ii of the eastern district came to their assistance, theyposed found nothing alive but some cattle and flocks of sheepe*tet"" running wild about the country. Perhaps they them-te^‘ selves afterwards experienced the same fate, and were totally destroyed by these Schrellings, whose descend¬ ants still inhabit the western parts of Greenland, and from tradition confirm this conjecture. They affirm that the houses and villages, whose ruins still appear, were inhabited by a nation of strangers, whom their ancestors G R E ancestors destroyed. There are reasons, however, for believing that there may be still some descendants of the ancient Iceland colony remaining in the eastern district, though they cannot be visited by land, on ac¬ count of the stupendous mountains, perpetually cover¬ ed with snow, which divide the two parts of Green¬ land ; while they have been rendered inaccessible by sea, by the vast quantity of ice driven from Spitzber- gen, or East Greenland. One would imagine that there must have been some considerable alteration in the northern parts of the world since the 15th century, so that the coast of Greenland is now become almost to¬ tally inaccessible, though formerly visited with very little difficulty. It is also natural to ask, By what means the people of the eastern colony surmounted the above-mentioned obstacles when they went to the assistance of their western friends $ how they returned to their own country j and in what manner historians learned the success of their expedition P Concerning all this we have very little satisfactory information","Green, Hudson, Green","GL,NO,US,IS",6,"Greenland,Norway,United States,Iceland","North America,Europe,North America,Europe"
"All that can be learned from the most authentic re- t cords is, that Greenland was divided into two districts, called Jrest Bygd and East Bygd: that the western di¬ vision contained four parishes and 100 villages : that the eastern district was still more flourishing, as being nearer to Iceland, sooner settled, and more frequented by shipping from Norway. There are also many ac¬ counts, though most of them romantic and slightly attested, which render it probable that part of the east¬ ern colony still subsists, who, at some time or other, may have given the imperfect relation above mention¬ ed. This colony, in ancient times, certainly compre¬ hended twelve extensive parishes, one hundred and ninety villages, a bishop’s see, and two monasteries",,"GL,IS,NO",6,"Greenland,Iceland,Norway","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The present inhabitants of the western district are en¬ tirely ignorant of this part, from which they are di¬ vided by rocks, mountains, and deserts, and still more effectually by their apprehensions: for they believe the eastern Greenlanders to be a cruel, barbarous nation, that destroy and eat all strangers who fall into their hands. About a century after all intercourse between Norway and Greenland had ceased, several ships were sent successively by the kings of Denmark in order to discover the eastern district; but all of them miscar¬ ried. Among these adventurers, Mogens Heinson, eo after having surmounted many difficulties and dangers, got sight of the land ; which, however, he could not approach. At his return, he pretended that the ship was arrested in the middle of her course by certain rocks of loadstone at the bottom of the sea. The same year, 1576, in which this attempt was made, has been rendered remarkable by the voyage of Cap¬ tain Martin Frobisher, sent upon the same errand by Queen Elizabeth. He likewise descried the land ; but could not reach it, and therefore returned to England ; G R E yet not before he had sailed sixty leagues in the strait which still retains his name, and landed on several islands, where he had some communication with the na¬ tives. He had likewise taken possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth ; and brought away some pieces of heavy black stone, from which the re¬ finers of London extracted a certain proportion of gold",London,"NO,GL,DK,GB",6,"Norway,Greenland,Denmark,United Kingdom","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe"
"Christiern IV, king of Denmark, being desirous of discovering the old Greenland settlement, sent three ships thither, under the command of Captain Godske Lindenow ; who is said to have reached the east coast of Greenland, where he traded with the savage inha¬ bitants, such as they are still found in the western di¬ strict, but saw no signs of a civilized people. Had he actually landed in the eastern division, he must have perceived some remains of the ancient colony, even in the ruins of their convents and villages. Lindenow kidnapped two of the natives, who were conveyed to Copenhagen ; and the same cruel fraud (a) was prac¬ tised C 89 ] (a) Nothing can be more inhuman and repugnant to the dictates of common justice than this practice of tearing away poor creatures from their country, their families, and connections ; unless we suppose them alto- get ler estitute 0 natural affection : and that this was not the case with those poor Greenlanders, some of w 10m roug it alive to Copenhagen, appears from the whole tenor of their conduct, upon their first cap- ure, an unng t icir confinement in Denmark. When first captivated, they rent the air with their cries and amen a 10ns . tiey even leaped into the sea ; and, when taken on board, for some time refused all sustenance, eir ejea were continually turned towards their dear country, and their faces always bathed in tears.

The same Admiral Lindenow made another voyage to the coast of Greenland in the year 1606, directing his course to the westward ot Cape Fdrewell. He coasted along the straits of Davis •, and having made some observations on the face of the country, the harbours, and islands, returned to Den¬ mark.

"Other expeditions of the same nature have been plan¬ ned and executed with the same bad success, under the auspices of a Danish company of merchants. Two ships returned from the western part of Greenland loaded with a kind of yellow sand, supposed to con¬ tain a large proportion of gold. This being assayed by the goldsmiths of Copenhagen, was condemned as useless, and thrown overboard ; but from a small quan¬ tity of’this sand, which was reserved as a curiosity, an expert chemist afterwards extracted a quantity of pure gold. The captain, who brought home this ad¬ venture, was so chagrined at his disappointment, that he died of grief, without having left any directions concerning the place where the sand had been disco¬ vered. In the year 1654, Henry Moller, a rich Dane, equipped a vessel under the command of David de Nelles, who sailed to the west coast of Greenland, from which he carried off three women of the country. Other efforts have been made, under the encouragement of the Danish king, for the discovery and recovery of the old Iceland colony in Greenland •, but all of them miscarried, and people began to look upon such expe¬ ditions as wild and chimerical. At length the Green¬ land company at Bergen in Norway, transported a colony to the western coast, about the 64th degree of latitude ; and these Norwegians sailed in the year iyi 2, accompanied by the Reverend Hans Egede, to whose care, ability, and precision, we owe the best and most authentic account of modern Greenland.— This gentleman endeavoured to reach the eastern di¬ strict, by coasting southwards, and advanced as far as the States promontory 5 but the season of the year, and contirtual storms, obliged him to return j and as he could not even find the strait of Frobisher, he con¬ cluded that no Such place ever existed.

"The soil of Greenland varies like that of all other mountainous countries. The hills are very barren, being indeed frozen throughout the whole year ; but the valleys and low grounds, especially near the sea, are rich and fruitful. The ancient Norwegian chro¬ nicles inform us, that Greenland formerly produced a great number of cattle 5 and that considerable quanti¬ ties of butter and cheese were exported to Norway ; and, on account of their peculiar excellency, set apart for the king’s use. The same histories inform us, that some parts of the country yielded excellent wheat ; and that large oaks were found here, which earned acorns as big as apples. Some ot these oaks stul remain in the southern parts, and in many places the marks of ploughed land are easily perceived. At present, however, the country is destitute of corn and cattle, though in many places it produces excellent pasture ; and, if properly cultivated, would probably yield grain also. Mr Egede sowed some barley in a bay adjoin- ! 1 ing to the Danish colony. It sprang up so fast, that by the latter end of July it was in the full ear j but being nipped by a night-frost, it never arrived at ma¬ turity. This seed was brought from Bergen, where the summer is of greater heat and duration than in Greenland; but in all probability the corn which grows in the northern parts of Norway would also thrive here. Turnips and coleworts of an excellent taste and flavour are also produced here. The sides of the mountains near the bays are clothed with wild thyme, which diffuses its fragrance to a great distance",Bergen,"NO,GL",6,"Norway,Greenland","Europe,North America"
"Greenland is thought to contain many mines of me¬ tal, though none of them are wrought. To the south¬ ward of the Danish colony are some appearances of a mine of copper. Mr Egede once received a lump of ore from one of the natives ; and here he found cala¬ mine of a yellow colour. He once sent a considerable quantity of sand of a yellow colour, intermixed with streaks of vermilion, to the Bergen company. They probably found their account in this present; for they desired him by a letter to procure as much of that sand as possible : but he was never able to find the place were he saw the first specimen. It was one of the smallest among a great number of islands ; and the mark he had set up was blown down by a violent storm. Possibly this might be the same mineral of which Captain Frobisher brought so much to England",Bergen,"GL,NO",6,"Greenland,Norway","North America,Europe"
"The animals which abound most in Greenland are, rein-deer, foxes, hares, dogs, and white bears. The hares are of a white colour, and very fat; the foxes are of different colours, white, grayish, and bluish ; and smaller than those of Denmark and Norway. The natives keep a great number of dogs, which are large, white, or speckled, and rough, with ears standing up¬ right, as is the case with all the dogs peculiar to cold climates. They are timorous and stupid ; and neither bay nor bark, but sometimes howl dismally. In the northern parts the natives yoke them in sledges; which, though heavy laden, they will draw on the ice at the rate of 70 miles in a short winter’s day. These poor animals are very ill rewarded for their service ; being left to provide for themselves, except when their masters happen to catch a great number of seals. On these occasions the dogs are regaled with the blood and entrails ; at other times they subsist, like wild beasts, upon muscles and berries. Here also are found great numbers of ravens, eagles of a prodigious size, falcons, and other birds of prey ; and likewise a kind of linnet, which warbles very melodiously. Whales, sword-fish, porpoises, &c. abound on the coasts ; also holybut, turbot, cod, haddock, &c. S The people who now inhabit the western coasts of Account of Greenland, and who, without doubt, are the descend-' dants of the ancient Schrcitings, who exterminated the first Iceland colony, bear a near resemblance to the Samoiedesand Laplanders in their persons, complexions, and way of life. They are short, brawny, and inclined to corpulency ; with broad faces, flat noses, thick lips, black hair and eyes, and a yellowish tawny com¬ plexion. They are for the most part vigorous and healthy; but remarkably short-lived; few of them reaching the grand climacteric ; and many dying in their infancy, and in the prime of youth. They are subject to a weakness in the eyes, occasioned by the piercing winds and the glare of the snow in the winter time. The leprosy is known among them, but is not contagious. Those that dwell in the northern parts are miserably tormented with dysenteries, rheums, and pulmonary disorders, boils, and epilepsy. The small¬ pox being imported among them from Copenhagen in the year I734> nia(le terrible havock among these poor people, who are utterly destitute of any knowledge of the medicinal art, and depend entirely for assistance upon their angekuts or conjurers. In their dispositions the Greenlanders are cold, phlegmatic, indolent, and slow of apprehension : but very quiet, orderly, and good-natured. They live peaceably together; and have every thing in common, without strife, envying, or animosity. They are civil and hospitable, but slo¬ venly to a degree almost beyond the Hottentots them¬ selves. They never wash themselves with water ; but lick their paws like the cat, and then rub their faces with them. They eat after their dogs without wash¬ ing their dishes; devour the lice which devour them; and even lick the sweat, which they scrape off"" from their faces with their knives.

"When they find a whale, they strike him with har¬ poons, to which are fastened with long lines some seal skins blown up like bladders. These, by floating on the surface, not only discover the back of the whale, hut hinder him from diving under water for any length of time. They continue to pursue him until he loses strength, when they pierce him with spears and lances till he expires. On this occasion they are clad in their spring coats, consisting of one piece, with gloves, boots, caps made of seal-skin so closely laced and sew¬ ed that they keep out water. Thus accoutred, they leap into the sea; and begin to slice off the fat, even under water, before the whale is dead.—They have many different ways of killing seals ; namely, by strik¬ ing them with a small harpoon equipped also with an air-bag; by watching them when they come to breathe at the air-holes in the ice, and striking them with spears; by approaching them in the disguise of their own species, that is, covered with a seal-skin, creep¬ ing upon the ice, and moving the head from side to side as the seals are accustomed to do. By this stra¬ tagem the Greenlander moves towards the unsus¬ pecting seal, and kills him with a spear. The Greenlanders angle with lines made of whale-bone cut very small, by means of which they succeed wonderfully. The Greenland canoe, like that used in Nova Zembla and Hudson’s bav, is about three fathoms in length, pointed at both ends, and three quarters of a yard in breadth. It is composed of thin rafts fastened together with the sinews of ani¬ mals. It is covered with dressed seal-skins both be¬ low and above, in such a manner that only a circular hole is left in the middle, large enough to admit the body of one man. Into this the Greenlander thrusts himself up to the waist, and fastens the skin so tight about G R E l 93 1 G R E tn(Ji about litm that no water can enter. Thus secured, mmj and armed with a paddle broad at both ends, he will venture out to sea in the most stormy weather to catch seals and sea-fowl ; and if he is overset, he can easily raise himself by means of his paddle. A Green¬ lander in one of these canoes, which vras brought with him to Copenhagen, outstripped a pinnace of 16 oars, manned with choice mariners.—The kone- boat is made of the same materials, but more durable $ and so large, that it will contain 50 persons with all their tackle, baggage, and provisions. She is fitted with a mast, which carries a triangular sail made of the membranes and entrails of seals, and is managed without the help of braces and bowlings. These kones are flat bottomed, and sometimes 60 feet in length. 'Hie men think it beneath them to take charge of them j and therefore they are left to the conduct of the women, who indeed are obliged to do ail the drudgery, including even the building and re¬ pairing their houses, while the men employ themselves wholly in preparing their hunting implements and fish¬ ing tackle","Hudson, Green, Copenhagen","US,DK",6,"United States,Denmark","North America,Europe"
"The height of one mountain seen here was found by geometrical mensuration to be at one time 1503^ feet, at another 1503^ feet. By a barometer constructed after De Luc’s method, the height was found to be 1588^ feet. On this occasion Capt. Phipps has the following remarks. “ I cannot account for the great difference between the geometrical measure and the barometrical according to M. de Luc’s calculation, which amounts to 84.7 feet. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of Dr Irving’s observations, which were made with great care. As to the geometrical measure, the agreement of so many triangles, each of which must have discovered even the smallest error, is the most satisfactory proof of its correctness. Since my return I have tried both the theodolite and baro¬ meter, to discover whether there was any fault in ei¬ ther 5 and find them, upon trial, as I had always done before, very accurate.” There is good anchorage in Schmeerenburgh har¬ bour, lying in N. Lat. 740 44', E. Long. 90 50' 43'', in 13 fathoms, sandy bottom, not far from the shore, and well sheltered from all winds. Close to this har¬ bour is an island called Amsterdam Island, where the Dutch used formerly to boil their whale-oil ; and the remains of some conveniency erected by them for that purpose are still visible. The Dutch ships, excepting in time of war, still resort to this place for the later season of the whale-fishery.—The rocks about this place are chiefly a kind of marble or limestone. No appearances of metals were observed, nor any signs of ancient or modern volcanoes. No insects, or any spe¬ cies of reptiles, were seen, not even the common earth¬ worm. There were no springs or rivers $ but great plenty of water was produced from the snow which melted on the mountains",,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"These islands are totally uninhabited, though it doth not appear but that human creatures could subsist on them, notwithstanding their vicinity to the pole.— Eight English sailors, who were accidentally left here by a whale-fishing ship, survived the winter, and were brought home next season. The Dutch then attempted to settle a colony on Amsterdam island above mention¬ ed ; but all the people perished, not through the seve¬ rity of the climate, but of the scurvy, owing to the want of those remedies which are now happily disco¬ vered, and which are found to be so effectual in pre¬ venting and curing that dreadful disease.—The late ac¬ count also of six Russian sailors who staid four years in this inhospitable country, affords a decisive proof, that a colony might be settled on East Greenland, provided the doing so could answer any good purpose",Amsterdam,"US,RU",6,"United States,Russian Federation","North America,Europe"

"In 1638, M. Poincy, a Frenchman, attempted to make a settlement in Grenada ; but was driven off by the Caribbeans, who resorted to this island in greater numbers than to the neighbouring ones, probably on account of the game with which it abounded. In 1650, Mons. Parquet, governor of Martinico, carried over from that island 200 men, furnished with presents to reconcile the savages to them ; but with arms to sub¬ due them, in case they should prove intractable. The savages are said to have been frightened into submis¬ sion by the number of the Frenchmen : but, according to some French writers, the chief not only welcomed the new-comers; but, in consideration of some knives, hatchets, scissars, and other toys, yielded to Parquet the sovereignty of the island, reserving to themselves their own habitations. The Abbe Raynal informs us, that these first French colonists, imagining they had purchased the island by these trifles, assumed the sove¬ reignty, and soon acted as tyrants. The Caribs, un¬ able to contend with them by force, took their usual method of murdering all those whom they found in a defenceless state. This produced a war ; and the French settlers having received a reinforcement of 300 men from Martinico, forced the savages to retire to a mountain ; from whence, after exhausting all their ar¬ rows, they rolled down great logs of wood on their enemies. Here they were joined by other savages from the neighbouring islands, and again attacked the French, but were defeated anew ; and were at last dri¬ ven to such desperation, that 40 of them, who had esca¬ ped from the slaughter, jumped from a precipice into the sea, where they all perished, rather than fall into the hands of their implacable enemies. From thence the rock was called le morne des sauteurs, or “ the hill of the leapers which name it still retains. The French then destroyed the habitations and all the pro¬ visions of the savages ; but fresh supplies of Carib¬ beans arriving, the war was renewed with great vigour, and great numbers of the French were killed. Upon this they resolved totally to exterminate the natives: and having according attacked the savages unawares, they inhumanly put to death the women and children, as well as the men; burning all their boats and ca¬ noes, to cut oft’ all communication between the few survivors and the neighbouring islands. Notwithstand¬ ing all these barbarous precautions, however, the Ca¬ ribbees proved the irreconcileable enemies of theFrench; and their frequent insurrections at last obliged Par* quet to sell all his property in the island to the Count de Cerillac in 1657. new proprietor, who pur¬ chased Parquet’s property for 30,000 crowns, sent thither a person of brutal manners to govern the island. He behaved with such insupportable tyranny, that most of the colonists retired to Martinico ; and the few who remained condemned him to death af¬ ter a formal trial. In the whole court of justice that tried this miscreant, there was only one man (called Archangcli') who could write. A farrier was the per¬ son who impeached : and he, instead of the signatures, sealed with a horse-shoe ; and Archangeli, who per¬ formed to¬ wn ORE [ 103 ] GEE formed the office of clerk, wrote round it these words in French, “ Mark of M. de la Brie, counsel for the court.” It was apprehended that the court of i ranee wouki not ratify a sentence passed with such unusual formali¬ ties $ and therefore most of the judges of the governor’s crimes, and witnesses of his execution, disappeared",Mons,"FR,GD,BE",6,"France,Grenada,Belgium","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Only those remained whose obscurity screened them from the pursuit of the laws. By an estimate, taken in 1700, there were at Grenada no more than 251 white people, 53 free savages or mulattoes, and 525 slaves. The useful animals were reduced to 64 horses and 569 head of horned cattle. The whole culture consisted of three plantations of sugar and 52 of in¬ digo.—The island had been sold in 1664 to the French West India company for 100,000 livres",,"GD,FR",6,"Grenada,France","North America,Europe"
"This unfavourable state of the affairs of Grenada was changed in 1714. The change was owing to the flourishing condition of Martinico. The richest of the ships from that island were sent to the Spanish coasts, and in their way touched at Grenada to take in refreshments. The trading privateers, who under¬ took this navigation, taught the people of that island the value of their soil, which only required cultivation",,"GD,ES",6,"Grenada,Spain","North America,Europe"
"Some traders furnished the inhabitants with staves and utensils to erect sugar plantations. An open account was established between the two colonies. Grenada was clearing its debts gradually by its rich produce $ and the balance was on the point of being closed, when the war in 1744 interrupted the communication between the two islands, and at the same time stopped the progress of the sugar-plantations. This loss was supplied by the culture of coffee, which was pursued during the hostilities with all the activity and eager¬ ness that industry could inspire.—The peace of 1 748 revived all the labours, and opened all the former sour¬ ces of wealth. In 1753, the population of Grenada consisted of 1262 white people, 175 free negroes, and 11,991 slaves. The cattle amounted to 2298 horses or mules, 2456 head of horned cattle, 3278 sheep, 902 goats, and 331 hogs. The cultivation rose to 83 sugar plantations, 2,725,600 coffee trees, 150,300 cocoa-trees, and 800 cotton plants. The provisions consisted of 5,740,450 trenches of cassada, 933,596 banana trees, and 143 squares of potatoes and yams. The colony made a rapid progress, in proportion to the excellence of its soil; but in 1762 the island was taken by the British. At this time one of the mountains at the side of St George’s har¬ bour was strongly fortified, and might have made a good defence, but surrendered without firing a gun ; and by the treaty concluded in 1763 the island was ceded to Britain. On this cession, and the manage¬ ment of the colony after that event, the abbe Raynal has the following remarks.—“ This long train of evils [the ambition and mismanagement of his countrymenJ has thrown Grenada into the hands of the English, who are in possession of this conquest by the treaty of 1763* But how long will they keep this colony? Or, will it never again be restored to France ?—Eng¬ land has not made a fortunate beginning. In the first enthusiasm raised by an acquisition, of which the highest opinion had been previously formed, every one was eager to purchase estates there. They sold for much more than their real value. This caprice, by expelling old colonists who were inured to the cli¬ mate, has sent about 1,553,000!. out of the mother- country. This imprudence has been followed by ano¬ ther. The new proprietors, misled, no doubt, by na¬ tional pride, have substituted new methods to those of their predecessors. They have attempted to alter the mode of living among their slaves. The negroes, who from their very ignorance are more attached to their customs than other men, have revolted. It hath been found necessary to send out troops, and to shed blood",,"GD,FR,GB,UK",6,"Grenada,France,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"The whole colony was filled with suspicions. Ihe masters who had laid themselves under a necessity of using violent methods, were afraid of being burnt or massacred in their own plantations. The labours have declined, or been totally interrupted. rl ranquillity has at length been restored. The number of slaves has been increased as far as 40,000, and the produce has been raised to the treble of what it was under the French government. The plantation will still be im¬ proved by the neighbourhood of a dozen of islands, called the Grenadines or Grenadilloes, that are depend¬ ent on the colony. They are from three to eight leagues in circumference. The air is wholesome. Tire ground, covered only with thin bushes, has not been screened from the sun. It exhales none of those noxious vapours which are fatal to the husbandman. Cariacou, the only one of the Grenadines which the French have occupied, was at first frequented by turtle fishermen ; who, in the leisure afforded them by so easy an occu¬ pation, employed themselves in clearing the ground",Tire,"FR,TR",6,"France,Turkey","Europe,Asia"
"The island flourished from the liberty that was enjoyed there. The inhabitants collected about I2C0 slaves, by whose labours they made themselves a revenue of near 20,oool. a-year in cotton.—The other Grenadines do not afford a prospect of the same advantages, though the plantation of sugar is begun there. It has succeed¬ ed remarkably well at Becouya, the largest and most fertile of these islands, which is no more than two leagues distant from St Vincent.” In the year 1779, the conquest of this island was accomplished by D’Estaign the French admiral, who had been prevented from attempting it before by his enterprise against St Vincent. Immediately after his conquest of St Lucia, however, being reinforced by a squadron under M. de laMotte, he set sail for Grenada with a fleet of 26 sail of the line and 1 2 frigates, ha¬ ving on board 10,000 laud forces. Here he arrived on the second of July; and landed 3000 troops, chiefly Irish, being part of the brigade composed of natives of Ireland in the service of France. These were con¬ ducted by Count Dillon, who disposed them in such a manner as to surround the bill that overlooks and commands George’s town, together with the fort and harbour. To oppose these, Lord M‘Cartney, the governor, had only about 150 regulars, and 300 or 400 armed inhabitants ; but though all resistance was evidently vain, he determined nevertheless to make an honourable and gallant defence. The preparations be made were such as induced D’Estaign himself to be present at the attack ; and, even with his vast superiori¬ ty of force, the first attack on the entrenchments proved unsuccessful",George,"IE,FR,GD,ZA",6,"Ireland,France,Grenada,South Africa","Europe,Europe,North America,Africa"
"G R E [ 104- ] G R E unsuccessful. The second continued two hours j when the garrison were obliged to yield to the immense dis-- parity of numbers who assaulted them, alter having killed or wounded 300 of their antagonists. Having thus made themselves masters of the intrenchments on the hill, the French turned the cannon of them to¬ wards the fort which lay under it; on which the go¬ vernor demanded a capitulation. Ihe terms, however, were so extraordinary and unprecedented, that both the governor and inhabitants agreed in rejecting them ; and determined rather to surrender without any con¬ ditions at all than upon those which appeared so ex¬ travagant. On this occasion D’Estaign is said to have behaved in a very haughty and severe manner ; indul¬ ging his soldiers also in the most unwarrantable liber¬ ties, and in which they would have proceeded much farther had they not been restrained by the Irish troops in the French service",,"FR,IE",6,"France,Ireland","Europe,Europe"
"In the mean time Admiral Byron, who had been convoying the homeward-bound West India fleet, ha¬ stened to St Vincent, in hopes of recovering it ; but being informed, by the way, that a descent had been made at Grenada, he changed his course, hoping that JLord M‘Cartney would be able to hold out till his ar¬ rival. On the sixth of July he came in sight of the French fleet *, and, without regarding D’Estaign’s su¬ periority of six ships of the line and as many frigates, determined if possible to force him to a close engage¬ ment. The French commander, however, was not so confident of his own prowess as to run the risk of an encounter of this kind •, and having already at- chieved his conquest, had no other view than to pre¬ serve it. His designs were facilitated by the good condition of his fleet; which being more lately come out of port than that of the British, sailed faster, so that he was thus enabled to keep at what distance he pleased. The engagement began about eight in the morning, when Admiral Barrington with his own and two other ships got up to the van of the enemy, which they attacked with the greatest spirit. As the other ships of his division, however, were not able to get up to his assistance, these three ships were necessarily obliged to encounter a vast superiority, and of consequence suf¬ fered exceedingly. The battle was carried on from be¬ ginning to end in the same unequal manner j nor were the British commanders, though they used their utmost efforts for this purpose, able to bring the French to a close engagement. Thus Captains Collingwood, Ed¬ wards, and Cornwallis, stood the fire of the whole French fleet for some time. Captain Fanshavv of the Monmouth, a 64 gun ship, threw himself singly in the way of the enemy’s van j and Admiral Ilowley and Captain Butchart fought at the same disadvantage: so that finding it impossible to continue the engagement with any probability of success, a general cessation of firing took place about noen. It recommenced in the same manner about two in the afternoon ; and lasted, with different interruptions,'till the evening. During this action some of the British ships had forced their way into St George’s harbour, not imagining that the enemy were already in possession of the island",Collingwood,"FR,GB,GD,CA",6,"France,United Kingdom,Grenada,Canada","Europe,Europe,North America,North America"
"They were soon undeceived, however, by perceiving the French colours flying ashore, and the guns and batteries firing at them. This discovery put an end to the design which had brought on the engagement j 5 and as it was now high time to think of providing for the safety of the British transports, which were in dan-'—ys ger from the number of the enemy’s frigates, the en¬ gagement was finally discontinued. During this action some of Admiral Byron’s ships had suffered extremely",,"FR,GB",6,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"The Lion of 64 guns, Captain Cornwallis, was found incapable of rejoining the fleet which were plying to windward j and was therefore obliged to bear away alone before the wind. Two other ships lay far astern in a very distressed situation ; but no attempt was made to capture them, nor did the French admiral show the least inclination to renew the engagement",,FR,6,France,Europe
"When the levelling spirit of the French revolution threatened to banish all rational liberty and subordina¬ tion from the face of the earth, the ill-fated island of Grenada did not escape the contagion. The slaves in this island were early tinctured with the love and ad¬ miration of those principles which subverted the mo¬ narchy of France. They were of consequence ready to revolt at the instigations of republican emissaries, who in 1795 effected a landing from the island of Gua¬ deloupe in considerable numbers. Yet many of the slaves hesitated at first to take an active part in this un¬ natural rebellion against the British government} but their perseverance was at length shaken by the alluring temptations which were held out to them, of participat¬ ing of the property of their plundered masters, and the flattering promises of total emancipation",,"FR,GB",6,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"As the French troops had been too successful in their attack upon Guadaloupe, the disaffected negroes in Grenada who spoke the French language, as well as numbers of white people who were charmed with the extravagant doctrine of liberty and equality, were en¬ couraged to project and execute a revolt from the Bri¬ tish government, every step of which they marked with plunder and with blood. Having effected a landing at Grenville or La Baye, and Charlotte town, on different sides of the island, the insurgents, to the number of too, surrounded the former place, and about one o’clock in the morning (March 6. 1795) plundered the dwelling and storehouses, and dragging the innocent, the astonish¬ ed inhabitants into the streets, set them up as marks to be shot at. When they fell before the discharge of their musketry, the inhuman banditti mangled their bodies with cutlasses in the most shocking manner. At this time there were 14 English inhabitants in the town, only three of whom escaped the insatiable ven¬ geance of those pretended lovers of freedom !

It is divided into three leagues, viz. the Grison or grey league, the league of the house oj God, and that of the ten jurisdictions ; which unite and term one republic. The two first lie towards the south, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above 70 miles, and the breath about 60. The in¬ habitants are said to have had the name of Orisons from the grey coats they wore in former times. This coun¬ try, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous ; but the mountains yield good pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats, with some rye and barley : in the valleys there is plenty of grain, pulse, fruits, and wine. This coun¬ try also abounds with hogs and wild-fowl } but there is a scarcity of fish and salt, and their horses are mostly purchased of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are also several lakes, most of which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Grisons is either a corrupt Italian or the German. Each of the leagues is subdivided into several lesser communities, which are so many demo¬ cracies ; every male above 16 having a share in the go¬ vernment of the community, and a vote in the election of magistrates.

The communities may be compa¬ red to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the seve¬ ral leagues to the provincial states. The particular diets are composed of a deputy from each community ; and both in them and the communities every thing is deter¬ mined by a majority of votes.

The necessary qualifications for admission into the church ought to be the knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin ; but this rule is not strictly adhered to; many being ordained without the least acquaintance with ei¬ ther of those languages. Formerly Latin was solely ii ] G R O used, as well in the debates of the synod as for the Grisons purpose of examining the candidates ; but at present (| that tongue grows more and more into disuse, and Ger-Groni,,S*n- man is employed in its stead. v The number of reformed parishes in the whole three leagues amounts to 135, in the following proportion : —In the Grey League 46, in that of God’s House 53, and in the League of Ten Jurisdictions 36. The mi¬ nisters of these churches enjoy but very small salaries",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"The richest benefices do not perhaps yield more than 20I. or at most 25I. per annum, and the poorest some¬ times scarcely 61. This scanty income is attended with many inconveniences. It obliges the clergy who have families to follow some branch of traffic, to the neglect of their ecclesiastical studies, and to the degradation of the professional character. Another inconvenience is superadded to the narrowness of their income. In most communities the ministers, though confirmed by the synod, are chosen by the people of the parish, and are solely dependent on their bounty. In 1798, the Grisons, who had formerly been only the al¬ lies of the Swiss, were incorporated with the confe¬ deracy as a canton, which still remained however di¬ vided into the three leagues as before. The whole po¬ pulation of the Grisons has been recently estimated at 73,000, of whom 26,000 speak German, 10,000 Ita¬ lian, and 37,000 the Romansh, or ancient Rhcetian lan¬ guage.

He was not 24 when he was appointed attorney-general. In 1613 he settled in Rotterdam, and was nominated syndic of that city ; but did not accept of the office till a pro¬ mise ivas made him that he should not be removed from it. This prudent precaution he took from his foreseeing, that the quarrels of the divines on the doc¬ trine of grace, which had alieady given rise to many factions in the state, would occasion revolutions in the chief cities. The same year he was sent into England on account of the divisions that reigned between the traders of the two nations, on the right of fishing in the northern seas; but he could obtain no satisfaction",Rotterdam,"FR,US,NL",6,"France,United States,Netherlands","Europe,North America,Europe"

On his return to Holland, his attachment to Barnevelt in¬ volved him in great trouble ; for he was seized, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in 1619, and to forfeit all his goods and chattels. But after having been treated with great rigour for above a year and a half in his confinement, he was delivered by the advice and artifice of his wife, who having observed that his keepers had often fatigued themselves with searching and exa¬ mining a great trunk full of foul linen which used to be washed at Gorkum, but now let to pass without open¬ ing it, she advised him to bore holes in it to prevent his being stilled, and then to get into it. He complied with this advice, and was carried to a friend’s house in Gorkum ; where dressing himself like a mason, and taking a rule and trowel, he passed through the market¬ place, and stepping into a boat went to Valvet in Brabant. Here he made himself known to some Ar¬ minians, and hired a carriage to Antwerp. At first there was a design of prosecuting his wife, who staid in the prison; and some judges were of opinion that she ought to be kept there in her husband’s stead : how¬ ever, she was released by a plurality of voices, and uni¬ versally applauded for her behaviour.

"The Ladrone islands, and Guam in particular, were covered with inhabitants when they were discover¬ ed. It is said that Guam alone contained upon its coast more than 30,000 people. These men were fe¬ rocious savages and bold thieves, as all the islanders in the South seas are, undoubtedly because they were un¬ acquainted with the rights of property ; but they were so savage, so incapable of supporting the yoke or ci¬ vilization, that the Spaniards, who undertook to bring them under the regulations of law and order, have seen their numbers almost annihilated within the space of two centuries. Under the government of their missionaries, these fierce islanders, after having long defended, by cruel wars, the right of living like wild beasts under the guidance of instinct, being at last ob¬ liged to yield to the superiority of the Spanish arms, gave themselves up to despair : they took the resolu¬ tion of administering potions to their women, in order to procure abortions, and to render them sterile, that they might not bring into the world, and leave behind them, beings that were not free, according to the ideas that they had of liberty. A resolution so vio¬ lent, G U A [ 123 ] G U A 1. lent, and so contrary to the views and intentions of —' nature, was persisted in with so much obstinacy in the nine Ladrone islands, that their population, which at the time of the discovery consisted of more than 60,000 souls, does not now exceed 800 or 900 in the whole extent of the archipelago. About 20 or 30 years ago, the scattered fragments of the original natives were collected and established in the island of Guam, where they now begin to recover by the wise precautions, and prudent, though tardy, exertions of a government more adapted to the climate of these islands and to the genius of their inhabitants",,"GU,ES",6,"Guam,Spain","Oceania,Europe"

After setting forth the services which the Scots had performed for Charles VII. in expelling the English out of France, and reducing the kingdom to his obedience, he adds—“Since which Mit. of reduction, and for the service of the Scots upon that occasion, and for the great loyalty and virtue which he Seysil^ma- found in them, he selected 200 of them for the guard ster of re- of his person, of whom he made an hundred men at quests to arms, and an hundred life-guards : And the hundred tllat Jjrince“ men at arms are the hundred lances of our ancient or¬ dinances ; and the life-guard men are those of our guard who still are near and about our person.”—As to their fidelity in this honourable station, the histo¬ rian, speaking of Scotland, says, “ The French have so ancient a friendship and alliance with the Scots, that of 400 men appointed for the king’s life-guard, there are an hundred of the said nation who are the nearest to his person, and in the night keep the keys of the apartment where he sleeps. There are, moreover, an hundred complete lances and two hundred yeomen of the said nation, besides several that are dispersed through the companies : And for so long a time as they have served in France, never hath there been one of them found that hath committed or done any fault against the kings or their estate ; and they make use of them as of their own subjects.” The ancient rights and privileges of the Scottish life-guards were very honourable; especially of the twenty-four first. The author of the Ancient Alliance says, “ On high holidays, at the ceremony of the royal touch, the erection of knights of the king’s order, the reception of extraordinary ambassadors, and the public entries of cities, there must be six of their number- next to the king’s person, three on each side; and the body of the king must be carried by these only, where¬ soever ceremony requires. They have the keeping of the keys of the king’s lodging at night, the keeping of the choir of the chapel, the keeping the boats where the king passes the rivers; and they have the honour of bearing the white silk fringe in their arms, which in Fiance is the coronne coleur. The keys of all the cities where the king makes his entry are given to their captain in waiting or out of waiting.—He has the privilege, in waiting or out of waiting, at ceremonies, such as coronations, marriages, and funerals of the kings, and at the baptism and marriage of their chil¬ dren, to take duty upon him.

The great number and variety of tall, beautiful, and shady trees, which seem planted in groves; the verdant fields everywhere cultivated, and no otherwise divided than by those groves, and in some places a small foot-path, together with a great number of villages, contribute to afford the most delightful prospect; the whole coun¬ try being a fine, easy, and almost imperceptible ascent for the space of 40 or 50 miles from the sea. That the farther you go from the sea, the more beautiful and po¬ pulous the country appears; That the natives were kind and obliging, and so industrious, that no place which was thought fertile could escape being planted, even within the hedges which inclose their villages","Most, Gold Coast","CZ,AU",6,"Czechia,Australia","Europe,Oceania"
"P- Avtua says f, “ they are a sincere, inoffensive people, $ and do no injustice either to one another or to stran- Quines, gers.” Smith confirms this account, and says, “ that«—, the inhabitants are generally very good-natured, and exceeding courteous and civil. W hen the Europeans make them presents, which in their coming thither to trade they always do, they endeavour to return them doubly.” Bosman tells us, “ that his countrymen the Dutch, who were often obliged to trust them till they returned the next year, were sure to be honestly paid their whole debts.” There is in Benin a considerable order in govern¬ ment ; theft, murder, and adultery, being severely punished. Smith says, “ their towns are governed by officers appointed by the king, who have power to decide in civil cases, and to raise the public taxes : but in criminal cases, they must send to the king’s court, which is held at the town of Oedo or Great Benin. This town, which covers a large extent of ground, is about 60 miles from the sea.” Barbot tells us, “ that it contains 30 streets, 20 fathoms wide, and almost two miles long, commonly extending in a straight line from one gate to another j that the gates are guarded by soldiers j that in these streets markets are held every day, for cattle, ivory, cotton, and many sorts of European goods. This large town is divided into several wards or districts, each governed by its respective king of a street, as they call them, to admi¬ nister justice, and to keep good order. The inhabi¬ tants are very civil and good-natured, condescending to what the Europeans require of them in ,a civil way.” The same author confirms what has been said by others of their justice in the payment of their debts j and adds, “ that they, above all other Guineans, are very ho¬ nest and just in their dealings *, and they have such an aversion for theft, that by the law of the country it is punished with death.” We are told by the same au¬ thor, “ that the king of Benin is able upon occasion to maintain an army of 100,000 men j but that, for the most part, he does not keep 30,000.” See the ar¬ ticle Benin",,"BJ,NL",6,"Benin,Netherlands","Africa,Europe"
"5. The last division of Guinea from which slaves are imported, are the kingdoms of Congo and Angola: these lie to the south of Benin, extending with the interme¬ diate land about 1200 miles on the coast. Great num¬ bers of the natives of both these kingdoms profess the Christian religion, which was long since introduced by the Portuguese, who made early settlements in that country. See Congo and Angola",,"AO,GN,BJ,PT",6,"Angola,Guinea,Benin,Portugal","Africa,Africa,Africa,Europe"
"In the Collection it is said, that both in Congo and Angola, the soil is in general fruitful, producing great plenty of grain, Indian corn, and such quantities of rice, that it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots, and palm oil in plenty. The natives are generally a quiet people, who discover a good understanding, and behave in a friendly manner to strangers, being of a mild conversation, affable, and easily overcome with reason. In the government of Congo, the king ap¬ points a judge in every particular division, to hear ami determine disputes and civil causes ; the judges im¬ prison and release, or impose fines, according to the rule of custom ; but in weighty matters, every one may appeal to the king, before whom all criminal causes are brought, in which he giveth sentence •, bat seldom condemneth to death. The town of Leanga stands in the midst of four lordships, which abound ia corn, G U I [ corn, fruit, &c. Here they make great quantities of cloth of divers kinds, very fine and curious ; the in¬ habitants are seldom idle; they even make needle-work caps as they walk in the streets. The slave-trade is here principally managed by the Portuguese, who carry it far up into the inland countries. They are said to send off from these parts 15,000 slaves each year. At Angola, about the tenth degree of south latitude, ends the trade for slaves",,"AO,IN,PT",6,"Angola,India,Portugal","Africa,Asia,Europe"
"As all these countries lie between the tropics, the air is excessively hot, especially from the beginning of Sep¬ tember to the end of March ; which, with the coolness of the nights, the frequent thick, stinking, sulphu¬ reous mists, and the periodical rains, when the flat country is overflowed, makes it very unhealthy, espe¬ cially to Europeans. The natives, however, are little affected with the unwholesome air. According to Bar- bot, they keep much within doors in tempestuous times ; and when exposed to the weather, their skins being suppled and pores closed by daily anointing with palm oil, the weather can make but little im¬ pression on them. They generally, therefore, enjoy a good state of health, and are able to procure to them¬ selves a comfortable subsistence, with much less care and toil than is necessary in our more northern climate : which last advantage arises not only from the warmth of the climate, but also from the overflowing of the rivers, whereby the land is regularly moistened and rendered extremely fertile ; and being in many places improved by culture, abounds with grain and fruits, cattle, poultry, &c. The earth yields all the year a fresh supply of food: Few clothes are requisite, and little art necessary in making them, or in the construc¬ tion of their houses, which are very simple, principally calculated to defend them from the tempestuous sea¬ sons and wild beasts; a few dry reeds covered with mats serve for their beds. The other furniture, ex¬ cept what belongs to cookery, gives the women but little trouble ; the moveables of the greatest among them amounting only to a few earthen pots, some wooden utensils, and gourds or calabashes; from these last, which grow almost naturally over their huts, to which they afford an agreeable shade, they are abun¬ dantly stocked with good clean vessels for most house¬ hold uses, being of different sizes, from half a pint to several gallons",March,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"J he most ancient account we have of the country History of of the negroes, particularly that part situated on and t^ie ^u^Ilea between the two great rivers of Senegal and Gambia,tra(,e' is from the writings of two ancient authors, one an Arabian, and the other a Moor. The first wrote in Arabic about the 12th century. His works, printed in that language at Rome, were afterwards translated into Latin, and printed at Paris under the patronage of the famous Thuanus chancellor of France, with the title of Geographia Nuhtensis, containing an account of all the nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia. The other was written by John Leo, a Moor, born at Grana¬ da in Spain, before the Moors were totally expelled from that kingdom. He resided in Afi ica ; but being on a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken by some Ita¬ lian corsairs, who finding him possessed of several Arabian books, besides his own manuscripts, appre¬ hended him to be a man of learning, and as such pre¬ sented him to Pope Leo X. This pope encouraging him, he embraced the Romish religion, and his de¬ scription of Africa was published in Italian. From these writings we gather, that after the Mahometan religion had extended to the kingdom of Morocco, some of the promoters of it crossing the sandy deserts of Numidia, which separate that country from Gui¬ nea, found it inhabited by men, who, though under no regular government, and destitute of that know¬ ledge the Arabians were favoured with, lived in con¬ tent and peace. The first author particularly remarks, “ that they never made war, or travelled abroad, but employed themselves in tending their herds, or labour¬ ing in the ground.” J. Leo says, p. 65. “ That they lived in common, having no property in land, no tyrant nor superior lord, but supported themselves in an equal state, upon the natural produce of the coun¬ try, which afforded plenty of roots, game, and honey","Rome, Paris, Tripoli, Tunis","SN,GM,US,FR,ES,MA,LY,TN,IT",6,"Senegal,Gambia,United States,France,Spain,Morocco,Libya,Tunisia,Italy","Africa,Africa,North America,Europe,Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Europe"
"That ambition or avarice never drove them into foreign countries to subdue or cheat their neighbours. Thus they lived without toil or superfluities.”—“ The an¬ cient inhabitants of Morocco, who wore coats of mail, and used swords and spears beaded with iron, coming amongst these harmless and naked people, soon brought them under subjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gambia into 15 parts ; those were the 15 kingdoms of the negroes, over which the Moors presided, and the common peo¬ ple were negroes. These Moors taught the negroes the Mahometan religion, and arts of life; particularly the use of iron, before unknown to them. About the 14th century, a native negro, called Heli Isc/iia, expelled the Moorish conquerors ; but though the ne¬ groes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a negro master. Heli Ischia himself becoming king, led the negroes on to foreign wars, a.id established himself in power over a very large S extent G U I [ 138 ] GUI Since Leo’s time, the Europe- night, would surprise some fishermen’s villages: that entered into the country, and carried off Guinea, extent of country.” —-vr——’ ans have had very little knowledge ot those parts ot Africa, nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly probable that it broke into pieces, and that the natives again resumed many of their an¬ cient customs j for in the account published by Moore, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Moorish and Mahometan customs, joined with the original simplicity of the negroes. It appears by accounts of ancient voyages, collected by Hackluit, Purchas, and others, that it was about 50 years before the discovery of America, that the Portuguese at¬ tempted to sail round Cape Bojador, which lies be¬ tween their country and Guinea : this, after divers repulses occasioned by the violent currents, they effected ; when landing on the western coasts of Africa, they soon began to make incursions into the country, and to seize and carry off the native inha¬ bitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gon¬ zales, the first who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coast, pursued and attacked a number of them, when some were wounded, as was also one of the Portuguese *, which the author re¬ cords as the first blood spilt by Christians in those parts. Six years after, the same Gonzales again at¬ tacked the natives and took 12 prisoners, with whom he returned to his vessels : he afterwards put a woman on shore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the prisoners j but the next day 150 of the inhabitants ap¬ peared on horses and camels, provoking the Portu¬ guese to land *, which they not daring to venture, the natives discharged a volley of stones at them, and went off. After this, the Portuguese still continued to send vessels on the coast of Africa : particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled, and, being pursued, 25 were taken ; “ he that ran best (says the author), taking the most.” In their way home they killed some of the natives, and took 55 more prisoners. Afterwards Dinisanes Dagrama, with two other vessels, landed on the island Arguin, where they took 54 Moors*, then running along the coast 80 leagues farther, they at several times took 50 slaves ; but here seven of the Portuguese were killed",Moore,"PT,GN,GM,MA,SN,US,LY",6,"Portugal,Guinea,Gambia,Morocco,Senegal,United States,Libya","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,North America,Africa"
"Then being joined by several other vessels, Dinisanes proposed to destroy the island, to revenge the loss of the seven Portuguese j of which the Moors being apprised, fled, so that no more than 12 were found, whereof only four could be taken, the rest being killed, as also one of the Portuguese.” Many more captures of this kind on the coast of Barbary and Guinea are re¬ corded to have been made in those early times by the Portuguese 5 who, in the year 1481, erected their first fort at D’Elmina on that coast, from whence they soon opened a trade for slaves with the inland parts of Guinea",Elmina,"PT,GN,GH",6,"Portugal,Guinea,Ghana","Europe,Africa,Africa"
"From the foregoing accounts, it is undoubted, that the practice of making slaves of the negroes owes its origin to the early incursions of the Portuguese on the coast of Africa, solely from an inordinate desire of gain",,PT,6,Portugal,Europe
"This is clearly evidenced from their own historians, particularly Cada Mosto, about the year 1455, who * Colke- writes*, “ That before the trade was settled for pur- tion, vol. i. chasing slaves from the Moors at Arguin, sometimes p. four, and sometimes more Portuguese vessels, were used to come to that gulf, well armed ^ and landing by 2 Guinei, they even entered into Arabs of both sexes, whom they sold in Portugal.” And also, “ That the Portuguese and Spaniards, set¬ tled on four of the Canary islands, would go to the other island by night, and seize some ot the natives of both sexes, whom they sent to be sold in Spain.” After the settlement of America, those devastations, and the captivating the miserable Africans, greatly in¬ creased",,"PT,ES",6,"Portugal,Spain","Europe,Europe"
"Anderson, in his History of Trade and Commerce, p. 336. speaking of what passed in the year 1308, writes, “ That the Spaniards had by this time found that the miserable Indian natives, whom they had made to work in their mines and fields, were not so ro¬ bust and proper for those purposes as negroes brought from Africa: wherefore they, about that time, began to import negroes for that end into Hispaniola, from the Portuguese settlements on the Guinea coasts j and also afterwards for their sugar-works.” It was about the year 1551, towards the latter end of the reign of Edward VI. when some London mer¬ chants sent out the first English ship on a trading voy¬ age to the coast of Guinea. This was soon followed by several others to the same parts $ but the English not having then any plantations in the West Indies, and consequently no occasion for negroes, such ships tra¬ ded only for gold, elephants teeth, and Guinea pepper","Anderson, London","GN,UK,US,GB,IN,PT",6,"Guinea,N/A,United States,United Kingdom,India,Portugal","Africa,N/A,North America,Europe,Asia,Europe"
"This trade was carried on at the hazard ot losing their ships and cargoes, if they had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese, who claimed an exclusive right of trade, on account of the several settlements they had made there. In 1553, we find Captain Thomas Wind¬ ham trading along the coast with 140 men, in three ships, and sailing as far as Benin, which lies about 3000 miles down the coast, to take in a load of pep¬ per. Next year John Eoke traded along the coast of Guinea, as far as D’Elmina, when he brought away considerable quantities of gold and ivory. He speaks well of the natives, and says, “ That whoever will deal with them must behave civilly, for they will not traffic if ill used.” In 1555, William Towerson traded in a peaceable manner with the natives, who made com¬ plaint to him of the Portuguese, who were then settled in their castle at D’Elmina $ saying, “ Jhey were bad men who made them slaves if they could take them, putting irons on their legs.” This bad example of the Portuguese was soon fol¬ lowed by some evil-disposed Englishmen : for the same Captain Towerson relates *, “ That in the course of* Cell his voyage, he perceived the natives near D’Elmina un-fcc»>’ willing to come to him, and that he was at last attack-P'5 ed by them j which he understood was done in revenge for the wrong done them the year before by one Cap¬ tain Gains!), who had taken away the negro captain’s son and three others, with their gold, &c. Tins caused them to join the Portuguese, notwithstanding their hatred of them, against the English.” The next year Captain Towerson brought these men back again; whereupon the negroes showed him much kindness","Elmina, Elmina, Elmina","PT,GH,BJ,GN,UK",6,"Portugal,Ghana,Benin,Guinea,N/A","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,N/A"
"The land they observed to be well cultivated, there being plenty of grain and fruit of several sorts, and the tawns prettily laid out. On the 25th, being in- ffirmed by the Portuguese of a town of negroes called Bytnba, where there was not only a quantity of gold, but 140 inhabitants, they resolved to attack it, ha¬ ving the Portuguese for their guide j but by misma¬ nagement they took but ten negroes, having seven of their own men killed and 27 wounded. They then went farther down the coast; when having procured a number ot negroes, they proceeded to the West In- ies, w lere they sold them to the Spaniards.” And in the same Naval Chronicle, at p. 76. it is said, “ That in the year I5^7» Francis Drake, before performing Guinea.",,"PT,GN",6,"Portugal,Guinea","Europe,Africa"
"arose from the misrepresentation made to her of thev*^’225» situation of the negroes, and of the advantages it was' pretended they would reap from being made acquaint¬ ed with the Christian religion. This was the case of Louis XIII. of France : who, Labat, in his account of the isles of America, tells us, “ was extremely uneasy at a law by which the negroes of his colonies were to be made slaves $ but it being strongly urged to him as the readiest means of their conversion to Christianity, he acquiesced therewith.” Nevertheless, some of the Christian powers did not so easily give way in this mat¬ ter : for we find f, “ That Cardinal Cibo, one of the iCollection, pope’s principal ministers of state, wrote a letter on v°h *'i",,FR,6,France,Europe
"behalf of the college of cardinals, or great council at^' Home, to the missionaries in Congo, complaining that the pernicious and abominable abuse of selling slaves was yet continued ; requiring them to remedy the same if possible *, but this the missionaries saw little hopes of accomplishing, by reason that the trade of the country lay wholly in slaves and ivory.” It has been rw ged in justification of this trade, that by purchasing the captives taken in battle, they save the lives of so many human creatures, who otherwise would be sacrificed to the implacable revenge of the victors. But this pretence has been refuted by an ap¬ peal to reason and fact. For if the negroes appre¬ hended they should be cruelly put to death if they yvere not sent away ; why, it is asked, do they mani¬ fest such reluctance and dread as they generally do, at being brought from their native country ? Smith, in his Account, p. 28. says, “ The Gambians abhor slavery, and will attempt any thing, though ever so desperate, to avoid it.” And Thomas Philips, in his account of a voyage he performed to the coast of Guinea, writes, “ They (the negroes) are so loth to leave their own country, that they have often leaped out of the canoe, boat, or ship, into the sea, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up.” But had the fact even been otherwise, the above plea is urged with an extreme bad grace, when it is notorious that the very wars said to be pro¬ ductive of such cruelty were fomented by the infamous arts of the Europeans. From the foregoing accounts, as well as other authentic publications of this kind, it appears, that it was the unwarrantable lust of gain which first stimulated the Portuguese, and afterwards other Europeans, to engage in this horrid traffic. By the most unquestionable relations of those early times, the natives were an inoffensive people, who, when civil¬ ly used, traded amicably with the Europeans. It is recorded of those of Benin, the largest kingdom in Guinea, that they were a gentle, loving people ; and Reynold says, “ They found more sincere proofs of S 2 love GUI [ 140 ] GUI Guinea, love ami good will from tlie natives, tlian they ctuld find from the Spaniards and Portuguese, even though they had relieved them from the greatest misery.” And from the same relations there is no reason to think otherwise, but that they generally lived in peace amongst themselves : there occurring no accounts of any wars at that early period, nor of any sale of cap¬ tives taken in battle",,"GN,PT,BJ",6,"Guinea,Portugal,Benin","Africa,Europe,Africa"
"In fact, it was long after the Portuguese had made a practice of violently forcing the natives of Africa into slavery, that we read of the diQerent negro nations making war upon each other, and selling their cap¬ tives. And probably this was not the case, till those bordering on the coast, who had been used to supply the vessels with necessaries, had become corrupted by their intercourse with the Europeans, and were excited by drunkenness and avarice to join them in carrying on those wicked schemes, by which those unnatural wars were perpetrated, the inhabitants kept in con¬ tinual alarms, the country laid waste, and, as Moore expresses it, “ infinite numbers sold into slavery.” But that the Europeans are the principal cause of these de¬ vastations, is particularly evidenced by one whose con¬ nection with the trade would rather induce him to represent it in the fairest colours, viz. Captain Smith, the person sent in the year 1726, by the African com¬ pany, to survey their settlements j who, from the in¬ formation he received of one of the factors who had re¬ sided ten years in that country, says, “ That the dis¬ cerning natives account it their greatest unhappiness, * Smith, that they were ever visited by tbe Europeans*.—That p. z66, we Christians introduced the traffic of slaves; and that before our coming they lived in peace.” In the accounts relating to the African trade, w'e find this melancholy truth farther asserted by some of the principal directors in the different factories: par- f Cn/iection, ticularly A. Brue says f, “ That the Europeans were far from desiring to act as peace-makers amongst the p. 9S, negroes ; which would be acting contrary to their in¬ terest, since tbe greater the wars, the more slaves were . procured.” And William Bosman also remarksJ, “ That J'- ^ ' one of the former commanders gave large sums of money to the negroes of one nation, to induce them to attack some of the neighbouring nations; which oc¬ casioned a battle which was more bloody than the wars of the negroes usually are.” This is confirmed by J. Barbot, who says, “ That the country of D’El- mina, which was formerly very powerful and populous, was in his time so much drained of its Inhabitants by the intestine wars fomented among tbe negroes by tbe Dutch, that there did not remain inhabitants enough to till the country.” It has also been advanced as an argument in favour of keeping the negroes in bondage, that there are slaves in Guinea, and that those amongst us might be so in their own country. Not to dwell upon the incon¬ sistency of our giving any countenance to slavery, be¬ cause the Africans, whom we esteem a barbarous and savage people, allow of it, and perhaps the more from our example ; the very circumstance stated, when in¬ quired into, must afford cause of blushing, rather than serve as a palliation of such iniquitous conduct: for it will appear, that the slavery endured in Guinea is by no means so grievous as that in the colonies. Captain Moore, speaking of the natives living on the river Gam¬ bia, says, “ That some of the negroes have many house r ","Moore, Moore","GN,US,PT,NL",6,"Guinea,United States,Portugal,Netherlands","Africa,North America,Europe,Europe"
"the negroes of North Guinea and the Gold Coast are said to be fond of their children, whom they love with tenderness. And Bosman says, p. 340. “ Not a few in his country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine, that pa¬ rents here sell their children, men their wives, and one brother the other: but those who think so, deceive themselves 5 for this never happens on any other ac¬ count but that of necessity, or some great crime.” The same is repeated by J. Barbot, p. 326. and also confirmed by Sir Hans Sloane in the introduction to his natural history of Jamaica ; where, speaking of the negroes, he says, “ they are usually thought to be ha¬ ters of their own children ; and therefore it is believed that they sell and dispose of them to strangers for mo¬ ney : but this is not true •, for the negroes of Guinea being divided into several captainships, as well as the Indians of America, have wars ; and besides those slain in battle, many prisoners are taken, who are sold as slaves, and brought thither : but the parents here, al¬ though their children are slaves for ever, yet have so great love for them, that no masters dare sell or give away one of their little ones unless they care not whe¬ ther their parents hang themselves or not.” J. Bar¬ bot, speaking of the occasion of the natives of Guinea being represented as a treacherous people, ascribes it to the Hollanders (and doubtless other Europeans) usurp¬ ing authority, and fomenting divisions between the ne¬ groes. At p. no. he says, “ It is well known that many of the European nations, trading amongst these people, have very unjustly and inhumanly, without any provocation, stolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coast, but almost every¬ where in Guinea, who have come on board their ships in a harmless and confiding manner : these they have in great numbers carried away, and sold in the plantations, with other slaves which they had purchased.” And al¬ though some of the negroes may he justly charged with indolence and supineness, yet many others are frequent¬ ly mentioned by authors as a careful, industrious, and even laborious people","Gold Coast, Holland, Bar","GN,JM,AU,US,UA",6,"Guinea,Jamaica,Australia,United States,Ukraine","Africa,North America,Oceania,North America,Europe"
"The king had recourse to this method, by seizing 300 of h is own people, and sent word to the director that he had the slaves ready to deliver for the goods.” It seems the king wanted double the quantity of goods whick gui [m Guinea, which the factor would give him for these 300 slaves j 'w-v "" ""> but the factor refusing to trust him as be was already in the company’s debt, and perceiving that this refusal had put the king much out ol temper, he proposed that he should give him a licence lor taking so many more of bis people as the goods he still wanted were worth: but this the king refused, saying, “ It might occasion a disturbance among his subjects.” Except in the above instance, and some others, where the power of the negro kings is unlawfully exerted over their subjects, the slave-trade is carried on in Guinea with some regard to the laws of the country, which al¬ low of none to be sold but prisoners taken in their national wars, or people adjudged to slavery in punish¬ ment for crimes •, but the largeness of the country, the number of kingdoms or commonwealths, and the great encouragement given by the Europeans, afford frequent pretences and.opportunities to the bold designing profli¬ gates of one kingdom, to surprise and seize upon not only those of a neighbouring government, but also the weak and helpless of their own j and the unhappy peo¬ ple taken on those occasions, are, with impunity, sold to the Europeans. These practices are doubtless disap¬ proved of by the most considerate amongst the negroes $ for Bosnian acquaints us, that even their rational wars are not agreeable to such. He says, “ If the person who occasioned the beginning of the war be taken, they will not easily admit him to ransom, though his weight of gold should be offered, for fear he should in future form some new design against their repose.” We shall conclude this article with the following ac¬ count of the shocking methods used in the carrying on of the slave-trade, as described by factors of different nations, * AtUey, Mr Moore *, factor for the English African Com- vol.ii p. sS. pany on the river Gambia, writes, “ That there are a number of negro traders, called /o/zcoes, or merchants, who follow the slave-trade as a business j their place of residence is so high up the country as to be six weeks travel from James Fort, which is situated at the mouth of that river. These merchants bring down elephants teeth, and in some years 2000 slaves, most of which, they say, are prisoners taken in war. They buy them from the different princes who take them ; many of them are Bumbrongs and Petcharies ; nations who each of them have different languages, and are brought from a vast way inland. Their way of bringing them is tying them by the neck with leather thongs, at about a yard distant from each other, 30 or 40 in a string, having generally a bundle of corn or elephants teeth upon each of their heads. In their way from the mountains, they travel through very great woods, where they cannot for some days get water $ so they carry in skin bags enough to support them for a time",,"GN,GM,BA",6,"Guinea,Gambia,Bosnia and Herzegovina","Africa,Africa,Europe"
"I cannot (adds Moore) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade, but there may, per¬ haps, be about 100, who go up into the inland country with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them purchase, in various coun¬ tries, gold, slaves, and elephants teeth. Besides the slaves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: These are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes j ot' else people stolen, which is very frequent.—Smcz the 2 ] GUI slave-trade has been used, all punishments are changed Gab* into slavery ; there being an advantage on such con- demnation, they strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the criminal.’1'' John Barbot, the French factor, in bis account of the manner by which the slaves are procured, says, “ The slaves sold by the negroes are for the most part prisoners of war, or taken in the incursions they make into their enemies territories j others are stolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods’, or else in the corn-fields, at the time of the year when their parents keep them there all the day to scare away the devouring small birds.” Speaking of the transactions on that part of Guinea called the Slave Coast, where the Europeans have the most facto¬ ries, and from whence they bring away much the greatest number of slaves, the same author says, “The inhabitants of Goto do much mischief in stealing those slaves they sell to the Europeans from the upland country.———That the inhabitants of Popo excel the former $ being endowed with a much larger share of courage, they rob more successfully, by which means they increase their riches and trade.” The author par¬ ticularly remarks, “ That they are encouraged in this practice by the Europeans: sometimes it happens, ac¬ cording to the success of their inland excursions, that they are able to furnish 200 slaves or more in a few days.” And he says, “ The blacks of Fida, or Whi- dah, are so expeditious in trading for slaves, that they can deliver 1000 every month.”—“ If there happens to be no stock of slaves there, the factor must trust the blacks with his goods, to the value of 150I. or 200I",Moore,"GN,US,FR",6,"Guinea,United States,France","Africa,North America,Europe"
"The slave-trade, indeed, was long considered as disgraceful to an enlightened age •, and in this country a spirit arose which seemed bent on annihilating it al¬ together, or so changing the nature of it as to blend humanity with policy. During the session 1788, the philanthropy of parliament, supported by that of the nation, paid a very particular attention to this odious branch of traffic. It was, however, a subject of too comprehensive a nature, and too materially connected with our African commerce at large and our West In¬ dian colonies, to come to an immediate decision upon it. Parliament, therefore, was obliged to content it¬ self for that time with a temporary bill to regulate the shipping and carrying slaves in British vessels from those coasts. The public attention was afterwards kept awake by a great variety of publications on both sides of the question j and the final arrangement of this important business, in which the honour of the British commerce and the British character, as well as the hap¬ piness of millions of our sable African brethren, is in¬ volved, was expected to take place during the session 1791. This humane measure was then unsuccessful ; but having been repeatedly brought forward and dis¬ cussed, the final abolition was agreed to by the legisla¬ ture in the year 1806",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"Their intention was to follow up the abolition by plans for diffusing civilization among the inhabitants of Western Africa. In the prosecution of this object, warned by the fate of the Sierra Leon Company, they kept clear of all commercial enterprises. They sent agents, however, to Sierra Leon to supply them with information. They have encouraged individuals to study the Arabic and other languages spoken in Guinea, as a means of spreading more accurate ideas here re¬ garding the inhabitants, and the productions of the Guinea, country. They have sent out African youths, previous- ly trained in Britain, to instruct their countrymen in the more simple and useful branches of elementary knowledge, and in some of the common arts.

"The first hint of the invention of guns in Europe is in the works of Roger Bacon, who flourished in the 13th century. In a treatise written by him about the year 1280, he proposes to apply the violent explosive force of gun-powder for the destruction of armies. In 1320, Bartholomew Schwartz, a German monk, is commonly said to have invented gun-powder, though it is certainly known that this composition is described by Bacon in some of his treatises long before the time of Schwartz. T he following is said to have been the manner in which Schwartz invented gun-powder. Ha¬ ving pounded the materials for it in a mortar, which he afterwards covered with a stone, a spark of fire ac¬ cidentally fell into the mortar and set the mixture on fire •, upon which the explosion blew the stone to a con¬ siderable distance. Hence it is probable that Schwartz might be taught the simplest method of applying it in war j for Bacon seems rather to have conceived the manner of using it to be by the violent effort of the flame unconfined, and which is indeed capable ®f pro¬ ducing astonishing effects *. The figure and name of*SesGl mortars given to a species of old artillery, and their^1^' employment (which was throwing great stone bullets at an elevation), very much corroborates this conjecture",,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"Soon after the time of Schwartz, we find guns commonly made use of as instruments of war. Great guns were first used. They were originally made of iron bars soldered together, and fortified with strong iron hoops; some of which are still to be seen, viz. one in the Tower of London, two at Woolwich, and one in the royal arsenal at Lisbon. Others were made of thin sheets of iron rolled up together and hooped j and on emergencies they were made of leather, with plates of iron or copper.

"Mortars are thought to have been fully as ancient as cannon. They were employed in the wars of Ita¬ ly, to throw balls of red-hot iron, stones, &c. long before the invention of shells. These last are thought to be of German invention, and the use of them in war to have been taught by the following accident. A citi¬ zen of Venlo, at a certain festival celebrated in honour of the duke of Cleves, threw a number of shells, one of which fell on a house and set fire to it, by which misfortune the greatest part of the town was reduced to ashes. The first account of shells used for military purposes is in 1435, when Naples was besieged by Charles VIII. History informs us with more certain¬ ty, that shells were thrown out of mortars at the siege of Wachtendonk in Guelderland, in 1588, by the earl of Mansfeld. Mr Malter, an English engineer, first taught the French the art of throwing shells, which they practised at the siege of Motte in 1634. The method of throwing red-hot balls out of mortars was first certainly put in practice at the siege of Stralsund in 1675 by the elector of Brandenburgh ; though some say in 1653 at f*16 siege of Bremen.

"He also assumes to himself the invention of the gun¬ ner’s quadrant, and often gave shrewd guesses at the event of some untried methods. But as he had not opportunities of being conversant in the practice, and founded his opinions only on speculation, he was con¬ demned by most of the succeeding writers, though often without any sufficient reason. The philosophers of those times also intermeddled in the questions hence arising •, and many disputes on motion were set on foot (especially in Italy^) which continued till the time of Galileo, and probably gave rise to his celebrated Dia- ogues on motion, Ihese were published in the year 1638 > but ia this interval, and before Galileo’s doc¬ trine was thoroughly established, many theories of the motion of military projectiles, and many tables of their comparative ranges at different elevations, were pu¬ blished ; all of them egregiously fallacious, and utter¬ ly irreconcileable with the motions of these bodies",,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"But though this hypothesis went on smoothly in speculation ; yet Anderson, who made a great number of trials, found it impossible to support it without some new modification. For though it does not appear that he ever examined the comparative ranges of either cannon or musket shot when fired with their usual velocities, yet his experiments on the ranges of shells thrown with small velocities (in comparison of those above mentioned), convinced him that their whole track was not parabolical. But instead of making the proper inferences from hence, and concluding the resistance of the air to be of considerable efficacy, he framed a new hypothesis ; which was, that the shell or bullet, at its first discharge, flew to a certain distance in a right line, from the end of which line only it be¬ gan to describe a parabola. And this right line, which he calls the line of the impulse of the fire^ he Sect, [, supposes to be the same in all elevations. Thus, by Tj,e assigning a proper length to this line of impulse, it was 4 always in his power to reconcile any two shots made at different angles, let them differ as widely as we please to suppose. But this he could not have done with three shots ; nor indeed doth he ever tell us the * event of his experiments when three ranges were tried j at one time. 6 f, When Sir Isaac Newton’s Principia was published,Lawi g he particularly considered the resistance of the air to the ai j. d projectiles which moved with small velocities ; but he never had an opportunity of making experiments^1^ on those which move with such prodigious swiftness, he did not imagine that a difference in velocity could make such difl’erences in the resistance as are now found to take place. Sir Isaac found, that, in small velocities, the resistance was increased in the duplicate proportion of the swiftness with which the body moved ; that is, a body moving with twice the velocity of another of equal magnitude, would meet with four times as much resistance as the first, with thrice the velocity it would meet with nine times the resistance, &c.—This prin- j^J ciple itself is now found to be erroneous with regard toinraj]i ^ military projectiles; though, if it had been properlyprojet. | attended to, the resistance of the air might even from thence have been reckoned much more considerable than was commonly done. So far, however, were those who treated this subject scientifically, from giving a proper allowance for the resistance of the atmosphere, that their theories differed most egregiously from the truth. Huygens alone seems to have attended to this principle : for, in the year 1690, he published a Treatise on Gravity, in which he gave an account of some experiments tending to prove, that the track of all projectiles moving with very swift motions was widely different from that of a parabola. All the rest of the learned acquiesced in the justness of Galileo’s doctrine, and very erroneous calculations concerning the ranges of cannon were accordingly given. Nor was any notice taken of these errors till the year 1716. ; At that time M. Bessons, a French officer of artillery,Alltl distinguished by the number of sieges at which he hadikori served, by his high military rank, and by his abilities'^1' in his profession, gave in a memoir to the Royal Aca-^| demy, of which he was a member, importing, that, “ although it was agreed, that theory joined with practice did constitute the perfection of every art; yet experience had taught him, that theory was of very little service in the use of mortars : That the works of M. Blondel had justly enough described the several parabolic lines, according to the different degrees of the elevation of the piece ; but that practice had con¬ vinced him, there was no theory in the effect of gun¬ powder ; for having endeavoured, with the greatest pre¬ cision, to point a mortar agreeably to these calqulations, he had never been able to establish any solid foundation upon them.” From the history of the academy, it doth not appear that the sentiments of M. Bessons were at any time controverted, or any reason offered for the failure of the theory of projectiles when applied to use. No¬ thing fai'ther, however, was done till the time of Ben¬ jamin Robins, who in 1742 published a treatise, en*Mr1^ titled, New Principles of Gunnery, in which he hathfi”1 ^ treated particularly not only of the resistance of tfie^* atmosphere, GUNNERY",Anderson,"US,FR",6,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"In some parts of Germany and Switzerland, how¬ ever, an improvement is added to this practice ; espe¬ cially in the larger pieces which are used for shooting at great distances.

"However frightful a broadside with double charges may appear at sea, more confusion is created by them, and more time lost, within board, by the strain and exces¬ sive recoil, than real damage done without board by the additional charge: for upon a trial on shore, where the eflect can be traced, it will be found, that, at 100 yards distance, more shot will take place within a small compass by single than by double charges ; and the charges will be oftener re peated in a given time, with¬ out heating the gun : and these facts being established, remove also the second objection.” I he following account of the proof of one of these guns will perhaps serve to give a more adequate idea of the great usefulness of them, than any description:— “ On Monday, Oct. 4. 1779* there was an experi¬ ment made at Carron, before the earl of Dunmore, &c. &e. with a 68 pounder carronade, nearly of the weight of a British navy 1 2-pounder gun, and charged with the same quantity, (viz. 61b.) of powder.—The cai ronade was mounted, on its proper carriages, into a port of the dimensions of a 74 |£un ship’s lower deck port j was pointed without elevation, at a centre of eight inches diameter, marked on a bulk’s head of the thickness G U N N E it Y",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

"-The manufacture of fire-arms is now carried to such a degree of perfection by different European nations, that it may perhaps be justly doubted whether any far¬ ther improvement in the requisites just mentioned can be made. For the materials, the softest iron that can be procured is to be made use of. The best in this country are formed of stubs, as they are called, or old horse-shoe nails $ which are procured by the gun¬ smiths from farriers, and from poor people who subsist by picking them up on the great roads leading to London. These are sold at about 10s. per cwt. and 28 pounds are requisite to form a single musket barrel",London,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"c barrels being thus bored and formed externally, it is customary with the gunsmiths in France to solder Cun- on the loops and aim before they breech the barrel. Smiihery",,FR,6,France,Europe
"The English, h owever, do not restrict themselves in this  v——' manner: for as soft solder is sufficient for fastening on these, they never use any other ; while the French, who use hard solder, must of consequence employ a great heat. Thus the inside is roughened sometimes so considerably, that it is necessary to repeat the fine boring ; which could not be done without injuring the threads of the screw formed for the breech, if the bar¬ rel were prepared for the latter without soldering on the former",,FR,6,France,Europe
"The operation for the French twisted barrels is very different from that just mentioned, and much more ex¬ ceptionable. It consists in heating the barrel by a few inches at a time to a strong red heat ; one end is then screwed into a vice, and a square piece of iron with an handle like an augre is introduced into the other. By means of these the fibres of the heated portion are twisted into a spiral direction, which is supposed to re¬ sist the effort of the inflamed powder better than the other. To render this operation complete, however, it must he observed, that when once the several por¬ tions of the barrel have been twisted, the subsequent heats ought not to be very great, or the grain of the metal will regain its former state, and the barrel be no better for the twisting than before. To twist a barrel in this manner, also, it will be necessary to forge it at least half a foot longer than it is intended to be, that a sufficient length may be kept cold at each end to give a sufficient purchase to the vice and tvvistinginstrument; and these portions must afterwards be cut off before the barrel is bored, or two pieces of an old barrel may be welded to the muzzle and breech of that which is to be twisted, and cut off when the operation is over",,FR,6,France,Europe
"These pieces may also be made stronger than usual to resist the force of the vice and twisting instrument; and in order to give the latter a firmer hold, the cavity of the muzzle may be made of a square form. The Eng¬ lish workmen are unanimously of opinion that this me¬ thod of twisting is really injurious to the barrel, by straining the,fibres of the metal. At any rate, from the injudicious methods followed by the French artists, the greatest part of their barrels, said to be twisted, are not so in reality ; there being at least six or seven inches at the muzzle, and seven or eight at the breech, which are not affected by the operation",,FR,6,France,Europe
"The Spanish barrels have long been held in great estimation, both on account of their being formed of better iron than those of other countries, and likewise from an opinion of their being more perfectly forged and bored. Those made at Madrid are the best, and even of these such as have been made by former gun¬ smiths are in the greatest estimation. The most cele¬ brated Spanish gunsmiths were Nicholas Biz, who lived in the beginning of the present century, and died in 1724; and the barrels fabricated by him in the former part of his life are held in greatest estimation. Those of his cotemporaries, Juan Belan and Juan Fernandez, are no less valued ; all of their barrels selling in France at looolivres, or 45I. 15s. sterling. The successors of these great artists were Diego Esquibal, Alonzo Mar¬ tinez, Agostin Ortiz, Matthias Vaera, Luis Santos, Juan Santos, Francisco Garcia, Francisco Targarone, Joseph Cano, and N. Zelaya. The most celebrated after these were Francisco Loper, Salvador Cenarro, Miguel Zeguarra, Isidoro Soler, and Juan de Soto",Madrid,"ES,FR",6,"Spain,France","Europe,Europe"
"The three first are gunsmiths to the king; and the bar¬ rels made by all of them sold for 13I. sterling. Almost all the Madrid barrels are composed of the old shoes of horses and mules, which are all collected for the pur¬ pose. They are manufactured first by welding longi¬ tudinally, and then being joined together in four or five pieces like the English barrels made from stubs, as al¬ ready mentioned. In this, and indeed all other opera¬ tions for making gun-barrels, an immense waste of the iron takes place ^ but that of the Spanish iron is by far the greatest, a mass of 40 or 45 pounds being required to make one barrel, which when rough from the forge weighs only six or seven pounds j so that from 30 to 38 pounds are lost in the hammerings. It may perhaps, however, be doubted, whether the iron be really puri¬ fied by this waste *, for it is certain, that by long conti¬ nued working in the fire it may be rendered totally use¬ less and destroyed •, neither can we lie assured that the other advantages pretended to result from the.ir method of manufacture are of any consequence. The Spanish artists likewise value themselves on giving the inside of their barrels a very high polish j but the advantage of this, as has already been observed, is extremely dubi¬ ous. The only thing requisite in a gun-barrel is that it do not lead; that is, that the mark of the bullet be not perceived on the inside after it has been discharged, by some of the lead rubbed off as it passes through. In the opinion of very good judges, therefore, it is better to take a barrel immediately after it has undergone the operation of fine-boring than to give it any higher po¬ lish and in support of this opinion, M. de Marolles, author of great reputation, informs us, that he has seen a barrel rough from the borer throw a charge of shot deeper into a quire of paper than one which was highly polished within, though the length, bore, and charge, were the same in both",Madrid,"ES,UK",6,"Spain,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"As the Spanish iron is universally allowed to be ex¬ cellent, it has not been unreasonably supposed that the superiority of the barrels manufactured in that king¬ dom is owing more to the goodness of the materials than to the skill of the workmen.

"The cause to which too great a recoil in muskets has been usually attributed, is the placing of the touch- hole at some distance from the breech-plug j so that the powder is fired about the middle, or towards its fore part, rather than at its base. To avoid this, some artists form a groove or channel in the breech-plug as deep as the second or third turn of the screw; the touch-hole opening into this channel, and thus firing the powder at its very lowest part. It appears, how¬ ever, from a number of experiments made upon this subject by M. le Clerc gunsmith to the king of France, that it made very little difference with regard to the recoil, whether the touch hole was close to the breech or an inch distant from it. The only circumstance to be attended to with respect to its situation therefore is, that it be not quite close to the breech-plug; as in such a case it is found to he more apt to be choked up than when placed about a quarter of an inch from it",,FR,6,France,Europe
"This opinion continued to prevail till about half a cen¬ tury ago, when it was first proposed as a doubt whe¬ ther long barrels carried farther than short ones. With regard to cannon, indeed, it had long before this time been known that they might be made too long; and Balthazar Killar, a celebrated cannon-founder in the reign of Louis XIV. was able to account for it. V hen asked by Mons. Suriry de St Remy, why the culverin of Nancy, which is 22 feet long, did not carry a ball equally far with a shorter piece ? he replied, that “ the powder, when inflamed, ought to quit the cavity of the piece in a certain time, in order to exert its whole force upon the bullet: by a longer stay, part of the force J ~ « GUN [ 199 ] GUN force is lost; and the same-cause may produce an ine- 7- quality in the shots, by giving a variation to the bullet, so as to destroy its rectilineal course, and throw it to one side or other of the mark.” Mr Robins, who on this as well as every other question in gunnery has al¬ most exhausted the subject, informs us, that “ if a musket-barrel, of the common length and bore, be fired with a leaden bullet and half its weight of powder, and if the same barrel be afterwards shortened one-half and fired with the same charge, the velocity of the bullet in this shortened barrel will be about one-sixth less than what it was when the barrel was entire ; and if, instead of shortening the barrel, it be increased to twice its usual length, when it will be near eight feet long, the velocity of the bullet will not hereby be aug¬ mented more than one-eighth part. And the greater the length of the barrel is in proportion to the diame¬ ter of the bullet, and the smaller the quantity of pow¬ der, the more inconsiderable will these alterations of velocity be.” From these considerations it appears, that the advantages gained by long barrels are by no means equivalent to the disadvantages arising from the weight and incumbrance of using them ; and from a multitude of experiments it is now apparent, that every one may choose what length he pleases, without any sensible detriment to the range of his piece. The most approved lengths are from 32 to 38 inches","Mons, Nancy","BE,FR",6,"Belgium,France","Europe,Europe"

"They are a strange kind of commonwealth among themselves of wandering impostors and jugglers, who made their first appearance in Germany about the be¬ ginning of the 16th century. Munster, it is true, who is followed and relied upon by Spelman, fixes the time of their first appearance to the year 1417 : as lle owns that the first whom he ever saw were in 1529, it is probably an error of the press for 1517 ; especially as other historians inform us, that when Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in the year 1517, several of the na¬ tives refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and re¬ volted under one Zinganeus ; whence the Turks call them Zinganees ; but being at length surrounded and ■ banished, they agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of su¬ perstition and credulity. In the compass of a very few years they gained such a number of idle proselytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and be¬ took themselves to the same arts of chiromancy, beg¬ ging, and pilfering), that they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.— Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1560, and from Spain in 1591. And the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in 1530 they are described by Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. as “ an outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, i> using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have come into this realm, and gone from shire to shire, and place to place, in great companies, and used great, subtle, ‘ and crafty means to deceive the people ; bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men’s and ( women’s fortunes ; and so many times by craft and shb- tility have deceived the people of their money, and also ► have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.” t Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, and forfei¬ ture of their goods and chattels ; and upon their trials > for any felony which they may have committed, they shall not be entitled to a jury de medietate linguce. And afterwards it is enacted, by statutes 1st and 2d Ph. and Mary, c. 4. and 5th Eliz. c. 20. that if any such per¬ sons shall he imported into the kingdom, the importer shall forfeit 40I.

"A very circumstantial account of this singular race of vagrants has been lately given in an express Inqiiii'y concerning them, written in German by H. M. G",,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"In the reigns of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, as we have seen, they were set up as a mark of ge¬ neral persecution in England ; yet their numbers do not appear to have much diminished. Spain is sup¬ posed by Mr Twiss to contain 40,000 of these va¬ grants ; but by others 60,000; and by some even dou¬ ble that number. They are less numerous in France in consequence of the strictness of the police. In Italy they abound, especially in the dominions of the church, on account of the had police and the prevalence, of su¬ perstition, which permit and entice them to deceive the ignorant. They are scattered, though not in great numbers, through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia ; but their chief population is in the south-east parts of Europe, which seem to be the general ren¬ dezvous of the gypsy nation. At a moderate compu¬ tation Europe contains more than seven bundled thousand of these vagabonds.—For near four centuries they have wandered through the world ; and in every region, and among every people, whether barbarous or civilized, thev have continued equally unchanged by the lapse of time,, the variation of climate, and the force of example. Their singular physiognomy and particular manners are the same in every country.-— Their swarthy complexion receives no darker shade from the burning sun of Africa, nor pny fairer tincture from the temperate climates of Europe : they contract no additional laziness in Spain, nor acquire any new industry in England; in Turkey they behold the mosque and the crescent with equal indifference as they do the reformed and the catholic church in Eu¬ rope. In the neighbourhood of civilized life they con¬ tinue barbarous ; and, beholding around them cities and settled inhabitants, they live in tents or boles in the earth, and wander from place to place as fugitives and vagabonds",,"ES,FR,DE,DK,SE,RU,TR",6,"Spain,France,Germany,Denmark,Sweden,Russian Federation,Turkey","Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia"
"They are passionately fond of ornaments; in which however they consult neither propriety nor consistency ; they will wear an old laced coat, while the rest of their garments scarcely hang together.

"These people, however, appear to be distinguished by different singularities in different countries. At least in the following circumstances the German gyp¬ sies differ widely from those we commonly meet with in England. It is a great feast to them, our author says, whenever they can procure a roast of cattle that died of any distemper. It is all one to them, whether it be carrion of a sheep, hog, cow, or other beast, horse-flesh only excepted; they are so far from being disgusted with it, that to eat their fill of such a meal, is to them the height of epicurism. When any one censures their taste, or shows surprise at it, they an¬ swer, “ The flesh of a beast which God kills, must be better than of one killed by the hand of man.” They therefore take every opportunity of getting such dain¬ ties. That they take carrion from a laystall, as is af¬ firmed of the gypsies in Hungary, is by no means cer¬ tain, any more than that they eat horse-flesh. But if a beast out of a herd dies, and they find it before it becomes rotten and putrified, or if a farmer gives them notice of a cow dead, they proceed, without hesitation, to get possession of this booty. Their favourite object is animals that have been destroyed by fire ; therefore, whenever a conflagration has happened, either in town or country, the next day the gypsies, from every neigh¬ bouring quarter, assemble and draw the suffocated half- consumed beasts out of the ashes. Men, women, and children, in troops, are extremely busy, joyfully car¬ rying the flesh home to their dwelling-places ; they return several times, provide themselves plentifully with this roast meat, and gluttonize in their huts as long as their noble fare lasts",,"HU,DE",6,"Hungary,Germany","Europe,Europe"
"“ Nothing (continues our author) can exceed the un¬ restrained depravity of manners existing among these people, I allude particularly to the other sex. Un¬ checked by any idea of shame, they give wav to every desire. Ihe mother endeavours, by the most scanda¬ lous arts, to train up her daughter for an offering to sensuality; and this is scarce grown up before she be¬ comes the seducer of others. Laziness is so prevalent among them, that were they to subsist by their own la¬ bour only, they would hardly have bread for two of the seven days in the week. This indolence increases their propensity to stealing and cheating, the common attend¬ ants on idleness. They seek to avail themselves of every opportunity to satisfy their lawless desires. Their universal bad character therefore for fickleness, infide- lity, ingratitude, revenge, malice, rage, depravity, la¬ ziness, knavery, thievishness, and cunning, though not deficient in capacity and cleverness, render these people ol no use in society, except as soldiers to form maraud- ing parties. Persons in their company, and under their disguise, have formed dangerous designs against cities and countries. They have been banished from almost all civilized states, in their turn, except Hungary and Transylvania, and to little purpose.” Our author opinion, G Y P [ 207 ] GYP liisies. opinion, that as Turkey would allow them toleration, w y—' it would be better for the European states to take some steps for cultivating and civilizing them, and making them useful. But while they are insensible of religion and strongly attached ta their own manners, it is to be feared the attempt will be impracticable. This ap¬ pears from a very- intelligent Hungarian lady’s experi¬ ence on the subject, communicated in a letter as fol¬ lows:. ‘ There are a great number of them on my estates, but I have permitted two families in particular to establish themselves at the place of my own residence, under the express condition that no others shall come here and join them. I took all possible pains to make them reasonable creatures. I set the elder ones to work j the younger ones tend the cattle. I observed that they were more fond of horses than any thing else j for which reason I placed a gypsy under each groom. I had their children clothed, that none of them might be running about naked, according to their usual practice",Un,"HU,TR,IN",6,"Hungary,Turkey,India","Europe,Asia,Asia"
"Their language differs entirely from the Coptic; and their customs are very different from those of the Egyp¬ tians. They are indeed to be found in Egypt j but they wander about there as strangers, and form a di¬ stinct people, as in other countries. The expressions of Bellonius are strong and decisive : “ No part of the world, I believe, is free from those banditti, wander¬ ing about in troops, whom we by mistake call Egyp¬ tians and Bohemians. When we were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of these strolling thieves sitting under palm trees j and they are esteemed foreigners in Egypt as well as among us.” The Egyptian descent of the gypsies being rejected, Gypsies, our author next endeavours to show that they come ''——y—— from Hindostan. The chief basis of his theory, how¬ ever, is no other than that very dubious one, a simila¬ rity of language. He adds a long vocabulary of the gypsy and the Hindostanic languagesin which, it must be confessed, many words are the same y but ma¬ ny are difterent. A principal proof which he adduces on this head is from the relation of Captain Szekely von Doha, to whom a printer in 1763 related, that a preacher of the Reformed church, when a student at Leyden, being intimately acquainted with three young Malabar students, took down laoo of their words, which he fancied corresponded with the gypsy language; and they added, that a tract of land in their island was named Ozigania. He repeated these words to the Ra— her gypsies, who explain them without trouble or hesi¬ tation. This account was published in the Vienna Ga¬ zette. Supposing these three young men to be sons of Bramins, who use the Sanscrit, the common language of Hindostan comes as near to that as modern Italian to pure Latin. The comparison of the two languages takes up above 30 pages ; and Mr Grellman thinks it establishes his system. The same opinion is maintained by Mr Marsden, in a paper upon this subject in the 7th volume of the Archeologia. The numerals, however, both in Hindostanic and gypsy, differ greatly as stated by the two authors. And here, as in other such com¬ parisons, one is astonished at the credulity of the com¬ parers of orthoepy and orthography (as a periodical cri¬ tic observes), which can have no connection in langua¬ ges with which we are not perfectly familiar, even were both languages reduced to writing by their respective people : how much less, then, where one of the two languages is never reduced to writing, as is the case of the gypsy, but it is blended with the language of the country where the clan resides ? This appears from the correspondence of several words in all languages with the gypsy. Mr Grellman acknowledges the two gypsy versions of the Lord’s Prayer, at different periods, differ so widely, that one would almost be inclined to doubt whether they were really the same language. We think we can discern a few words differently indeed written, but probably pronounced alike. Nor can we, in all the languages in which Chamberlayne gives the Lord’s Prayer, perceive the least resemblance to the gypsy name of father, Dade and Dady except in the Welsh, Taad. In prosecuting his argument, Mr Grellm&n does not insist on the similarity of colour between the two people, nor on the cowardice common to both, nor on the attachment of the Indians to tents, or letting their children go naked ; all these being traits to be met with in other nations: but he dwells on the word Polgar, the name of one of the first gypsy leaders, and of the Hindostanic god of marriage; also on the corres¬ pondence between the travelling smiths in the two peo¬ ple, who carry two pair of bellows ; the Indian’s boy blows them in India, the wife or child ot the gypsy in Europe : as if every travelling tinker, in every nation where tinkers travel, had not the same journeymen","Cairo, Doha","EG,IN,QA,IT,GB",6,"Egypt,India,Qatar,Italy,United Kingdom","Africa,Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe"

"The hair of both Jewish and Grecian women enga¬ ged a principal share of their attention, and the Roman ladies H A I air. ladies seem to have been no less curious with respect to '• theirs. They generally wore it long, and dressed it in a variety of ways, ornamenting it with gold, silver, pearls, &c.

"In after-times, the Anglo-Saxons and Danes also considered fine hair as one of the greatest beauties and ornaments of their persons, and were at no little pains in dressing it to advantage. Young ladies before niai’- riage wore their hair uncovered and untied, flowing in ringlets over their shoulders; but as soon as they were married, they cut it shorter, tied it up, and put on a head-dress of some kind or other, according to the pre¬ vailing fashion. To have the hair entirely cut off was so gieat a disgrace, that it was one of the greatest pu¬ nishments inflicted on those women who were guilty of adultery. The Danish soldiers who were quartered up¬ on the English, in the reigns of Edgar the Peaceable and of Ethelred the Unready, were the beaux of those times, and were particularly attentive to the dressing of their hair ; which they combed at least once every day, and thereby captivated the affections of the Eng¬ lish ladies. The clergy, both secular and regular, were obliged to shave the crowns of their heads, and keep their hair short, which distinguished them from the laity } aud several canons were made against their con¬ cealing their tonsure, or allowing their hair to grow long. The shape of this clerical tonsure was the sub¬ ject of long and violent debates between the English clergy on the one hand, and those of the Scots and Piets on the other ; that of the former being circular, and that of the latter only semicircular. It appears very plainly, that long flowing hair was universally esteemed a great ornament; and the tonsure of the clergy was considered as an act of mortification and self-denial, to which many of them submitted with re¬ luctance, and endeavoured to conceal as much as pos¬ sible. Some of them who affected the reputation of su¬ perior sanctity inveighed with great bitterness against the long hair of the laity ; and laboured earnestly to persuade them to cut it short, in imitation of the cler¬ gy. Ihus the famous St Wulstan bishop of Worcester, is said to have declaimed with great vehemence against luxury of all kinds, hut chiefly against long hair as most criminal and most universal. “ The English (says Wil¬ liam of Malmsbury in his life of St Wulstan) were very vicious in their manners, and plunged in luxury, through the long peace which they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The holy prelate Wul¬ stan reproved the wicked of all ranks with great bold¬ ness ; hut he rebuked those with the greatest severity who were proud of their long hair. When any of those vain people bowed their heads before him to receive his blessing, before he gave it, he cut a lock of their hair with a little sharp knife, which he carried about him lor that purpose ; and commanded them, by way of penance for their sins, to cut all the rest of their hair in the same manner. If any of them refused to comply with this command, he denounced the most dreadful judgments upon them, reproached them for their effe¬ minacy, and foretold, that as they imitated women in the length of their hair, they would imitate them in their cowardice when their country was invaded • which was accomplished at the landing of the Nor¬ mans.” Ihis continued to be long a topic of declamation among ,the clergy, who even represented it as, one of the greatest crimes, and most certain marks of repro- , bation. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went so „ far as to pronounce the terrible sentence of excom¬ munication against all who wore long hair, for which pious zeal he is very much commended. Serlo, a Norman bishop, acquired great honour by a sermon which he preached before Henry I. A. D. 1104, against long and curled hair, with which the king and all his courtiers were so much affected, that they consented to resign their flowing ringlets, of which they had been so vain. The prudent prelate gave them no time to change their minds, but immediately pulled a pair of shears out of his sleeve, and performed the operation :( with his own hand. Another incident happened about j 25 years after, which gave a temporary check to the i prevailing fondness for long hair. It is thus related by a contemporary historian : “An event happened, 1 A. D. 1129, which seemed very wonderful to our | young gallants ; who, forgetting that they were men, 1 had transformed themselves into women by the length l of their hair. A certain knight, who was very proud j of his long luxuriant hair, dreamed that a person suffo- S cated him with its curls. As soon as he awoke from i his sleep, he cut his hair to a decent length. The re- 1 port of this spread over all England, and almost all i the knights reduced their hair to the proper standard. ! But this reformation was not of long continuance ; ) for in less than a year all who wished to appear fashion- i able returned to their former wickedness, and contend¬ ed with the ladies in length of hair. Those to whom nature had denied that ornament supplied the defect by art.” The Greeks, and, after their example, the Romans, wore false hair","Young, Worcester, Wil, Canterbury, Norman","UK,UY,ZA,CH,GB,US",6,"N/A,Uruguay,South Africa,Switzerland,United Kingdom,United States","N/A,South America,Africa,Europe,Europe,North America"

The merit of good hair consists in its being well fed, and neither too coarse nor j too slender; the bigness rendering it less susceptible of ■ the artificial curl, and disposing it rather to frizzle, and ' the smallness making its curl of too short duration.

"Hale, Sir Mattheiu, lord chief justice of the king’s bench in the reign of Charles II. was the son of Ro¬ bert Hale, Esq. a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn, and was born in 1609. He was educated at Oxford, where he made a considerable progress in learning j but was afterwards diverted from his studies by the levities of youth. From these he was reformed by Mr John Glanvill serjeant at law ; and applying to the study of the law, entered into Lincoln’s Inn. Noy the attor¬ ney-general took early notice of him, and directed him in his studies. Mr Selden also took much notice of him *, and it was this acquaintance that first set Mr Hale on a more enlarged pursuit of learning, which he had before confined to his own profession. During the civil wars, ire behaved so well as to gain the esteem of both parties. He was employed in his practice by all the king’s party; and was appointed by the par¬ liament one of the commissioners to treat with the king. The murder of King Charles gave him very sen¬ sible regret. However, he took the engagement; and was appointed, with several others, to consider of the reformation of the law. In 1653 he was by writ made serjeant at law, and soon after appointed one of the justices of the Common Pleas. Upon the death of Oliver Cromwell he refused to accept of the new com¬ mission offered him by Richard his successor. He was returned one of the knights of Gloucestershire in the parliament which called home Charles II. Soon af¬ ter he was made lord chief baron of the exchequer ; but declined the honour of knighthood, till lord chan¬ cellor Hyde, sending for him upon business when the king was at his house, told his majesty, that “ there Was his modest chief baron j” upon which he was un¬ expectedly knighted. He was one of the principal judges that sat in Clifford’s Inn about settling the dif¬ ference between landlord and tenant, after the fire of London, in which he behaved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, and also in his post of chief baron acted with inflexible integrity. One of the first peers went once to his chamber, and told him, “ That ha¬ ving a suit in law to he tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better un¬ derstand it when it should come to be tried in court.” Upon which the lord chief baron interrupted him, and 23 ] HA L said, “ He did not deal fairly to come to his cham- Hale, hers about such affairs j for he never received informa- Hales, tion of such causes but in open court, where both par- 1 ■ 11 v—“ ties were to be heard alike.” Upon which his grace (for he was a duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the king as a rudeness that was not to be endured ; but his majesty bid him content himself that he was used no worse 5 and said, “ That he verily believed he would have used him po better if he had gone to solicit him in any of his own causes.” Another remarkable incident happened in one of his circuits. A gentleman who had a trial at the assizes had sent him a buck for his table. When Judge Hale therefore heard his name, he asked “ if he was not the same person who had sent him the venison ?” and find¬ ing that he was the same, told him, that “ he could not suffer the trial to go on till he had paid him for his buck.” The gentle man answered, that “ he never sold his venison ; and that he had done nothing to him which he did not do to every judge who had gone that circuit which was confirmed by several gentlemen present.

Soon after, he married Mary, the daughter and heiress of Dr Newce, who was rector of Halisham in Sussex, but resided at Much-Haddam in Hertfordshire. On the 13th of March 1718, he was elected a member of the Royal Society j and on the 5th of March, in the year follow¬ ing, he exhibited an account of some experiments he had lately made on the effect of the sun’s warmth in raising the sap in trees. This procured him the thanks of the society, who also requested him to prosecute the subject. With this request he complied with great pleasure j and on the 14th of June 1725 exhibited a treatise in which he gave an account of his progress","Mary, March, March","GB,TM",6,"United Kingdom,Turkmenistan","Europe,Asia"
"In 1741 he read before the Royal Society an ac¬ count of an instrument which he invented, and called 3 a ventilator, for conveying fresh air into mines, hos¬ pitals, prisons, and the close parts of ships : he had communicated it to his particular friends some months before ; and it is very remarkable, that a machine of the same kind, for the same purpose, was in the spring of the same year invented by one Martin Triewald, an officer in the service of the king of Sweden, called captain of mechanics, for which the king and senate granted him a privilege in October following, and or¬ dered every ship of war in the service of that state to be furnished with one of them : a model also of this machine was sent into France, and all the ships in the French navy were also ordered to have a ventilator of the same sort. It happened also, that about the same time one Sutton, who kept a coffeehouse in Aldersgate- street, invented a ventilator of another construction to draw off the foul air out of ships by means of the cook- room fire : but poor Sutton had not interest enough to make mankind accept the benefit he offered them j though its superiority to Dr Hales’s contrivance was evident, and among others Dr Mead and the inge¬ nious Mr Benjamin Robins gave their testimony in its favour (see Am-Pipes). The public, however, is not less indebted to the ingenuity and benevolence of Dr Hales, whose ventilators came more easily into use for many purposes of the greatest importance to life, particularly for keeping corn sweet, by blowing through it fresh showers of air $ a practice very soon adopted by France, a large granary having been made, under the direction of Duhamel, for the preservation of corn in this manner, with a view to make it a general practice","Sutton, Sutton","FR,GB,SE",6,"France,United Kingdom,Sweden","Europe,Europe,Europe"
"In 1743, Dr Hales read before the Royal Society a description of a method of conveying liquors into the abdomen during the operation of tapping, and it was afterwards printed in their Transactions. In 174^, he published some experiments and observations on tar- water, which he had been induced to make by the pub¬ lication of a work called Siris, in which the learn¬ ed and most excellent Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, had recommended tar-water as an universal medicine : on this occasion several letters passed between them on the subject, particularly with respect to the use of tar- water in the disease of the horned cattle. In the same year he communicated to the public, by a letter to the editor of the Gentleman’s Magazine, a description of a back-heaver, which will winnow and clean corn much sooner and better than can be done by the common me¬ thod. He also, at the same time, and by the same channel, communicated to the public a cheap and easy way to preserve corn sweet in sacks ; an invention of great benefit to farmers, especially to poor leasers, who want to keep small quantities of corn for some time, but have no proper granary or repository for that pur¬ pose. He also the same year took the same method to publish directions how to keep corn sweet in heaps without turning it, and to sweeten it when musty. He published a long paper, containing an account of seve¬ ral methods to preserve corn by ventilators ; with a particular description of several sorts of ventilators, il¬ lustrated by a cut, so that the whole mechanism of them may be easily known, and the machine constructed by a common carpenter. He published also in the same volume, but without his name, a detection of the fal¬ lacious boasts concerning the efficacy of the liquid shell in HAL in dissolving the stone in the bladder, communicated to the Eoyal Society a proposal for bringing small passable stones soon, and with ease, out of the bladder; and this was also printed in their Trans¬ actions. In the Gentleman’s Magazine for July 1747, be published an account of a very considerable improve¬ ment of his back-heaver, by which it became capable of clearing corn of the very small grain, seeds, blacks, smutt-balls, See. to such perfection as to make it fit for seed-corn. In 1748 he communicated to the Royal Society a proposal for checking, in some degree, the progress of fires, occasioned by the great fire which happened that year in Cornhill : And the substance of this proposal was printed in their Transactions. In the same year he also communicated to the Society two me¬ moirs, which are printed in their Transactions ; one on the great benefit of ventilators, and the other on some experiments in electricity. In 1749* his ventilators were fixed in the Savoy prison, by order of the right bon. Henry Fox, Esq. then secretary at war, after¬ wards Lord Holland ; and the benefit was so great, that though 50 or 100 in a year often died of the gaol distemper before, yet from the year 1749 to the year *752 inclusive, no more than four persons died, though in the year 175° the number of prisoners was 240; and of those four, one died of the small-pox, and another of intemperance. In the year 1750 he published some considerations on the causes of earthquakes ; occasioned by the slight shocks felt that year in London. The substance of this work was also printed in the Philoso* phical Transactions.

"-The cloths, at the first erecting of the woollen manu¬ factures in these parts, having been frequently stolen off the tenters in the night, a law was made, by which the magistrates of Halifax were empowered to pass sentence on and execute all offenders, if they were taken in the fact, or owned it, or if the stolen cloth was ound upon them, provided also the crime was com¬ mitted, and the criminal apprehended, within the liber¬ ties ot the forest of Hardwick.

But neither the cha¬ racter which he had before he left his native country, nor the fame which he had acquired and supported while abroad, were sufficient to combat the interest op¬ posed to him. He was disappointed in both} and it was even with difficulty that he obtained, in the fol¬ lowing year, the appointment of keeper of a public library at Bern. The exercise of this office was indeed by no means suited to his great abilities : but it was agreeable to him, as it afforded him an opportunity for that extensive reading by which he has been so justly distinguished. The neglect of his merit which marked his first outset, neither diminished his ardour for medi¬ cal pursuits, nor detracted from his reputation either at home or abroad. Soon after be was nominated a professor in the university of Gottingen, by King George 11.

"HALLEY, Dr Edmund, an eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in 1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676, he went to the island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of those which lie near the south pole ; and having delineated a planisphere in which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in 1678. In the year 1680, he took what is called the grand tour, accompanied by his friend the celebrated Mr Nelson. In the midway be¬ tween Calais and Paris, Mr Halley had a sight of a re¬ markable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in its return from the sun. He had the Novem¬ ber before seen it in its descent; and now hastened to complete his observations upon it, in viewing it from the royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was, to settle a friendly correspond¬ ence between the two royal astronomers of Greenwich and Paris j and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a master as Cassini. From thence he went to Italy, where he spent great part of the year 1681 j but his affairs calling him home, he returned to England. In 1683, he published his Theory of the va¬ riation of the magnetical compass; in which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, vyith four magnetical poles, or points of attraction : but af¬ terwards thinking that this theory was liable to great exceptions, he procured an application to be made to King YV illiam, who appointed him commander of the Paramour pink, with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty’s settlements in America.—He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698 : but having crossed the line, his men grew sickly ; and his lieutenant mutinying, he re¬ turned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he set sail a second time in Sep¬ tember following, with the same ship, and another of less bulk, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the vast Atlantic ocean from one hemisphere to the other, as far as the ice would permit him to go ; and having made his observations at St Helena Brazil, Cape Yerd, Barbadoes, the Madeiras, the Ca¬ naries, the coast of Barbary, and many other latitudes arrived in September 1700 $ and the next year publish- 2 ed a general chart, showing at one view the variation Han of the compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as U he was now called, had been at home little more than Halm half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe'""""""""7"" the course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal head-lands in the British channel : which having executed with his usual expedition and accuracy, he published a large map of the British chan¬ nel. Soon after, the emperor of Germany resolving to make a convenient harbour for shipping in the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to view the two ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702 j passed over to Holland} and going through Germany to Vienna, he proceeded to Istria : but the Dutch opposing the design, it was laid aside } yet the emperor made him a present of a rich diamond-ring from his finger, and honoured him with a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Presently after his return, he was sent again on the same business ; when passing through Hanover, he supped with King George I. then electoral prince, and his sister the queen of Prussia. On his arrival at Vienna, he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new for¬ tifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703 } and the same year was made pro¬ fessor of geometry in the university of Oxford, in the room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by that university.

"-v 'The courtier repairs to the queen’s apartment, and hides himself under a heap of straw (b). Hamlet, up¬ on entering the cabinet, suspecting the presence of some spy, imitates, after his usual affectation of folly, the crow of cock, and, shaking his arms like wings, jumps (c) upon the heap of straw ; till, feeling the courtier, he draws his sword, and instantly dispatches him. He then cuts the body to pieces, boils it, and gives it to the hogs. He then avows to his mother that he only personated a fool, reproaches her for her incestuous marriage with the murderer of her husband ; and concludes his remonstrances by saying, “ Instead, therefore, of condoling my insanity, deplore your own infamy, and learn to lament the deformity of your own mind (d).” The queen is silent ; but is recalled to virtue by these admonitions. Fengo returns to Elsi- neur, sends Hamlet to England under the care of two courtiers, and requests the king by a letter to put him to death. Hamlet discovers and alters the letter j so that, upon their arrival in England, the king orders the two courtiers to immediate execution, and betroths his daughter to Hamlet, who gives many astonishing proofs of a most transcendant understanding. At the end of the year he returns to Denmark, and alarms the court by his unexpected appearance ; as a report of his death had been spread, and preparations w'ere making for his funeral. Having re-assumed his affected insanity, he purposely wounds his finger in drawing his sword, which the bystanders immediately fasten to the scabbard. He afterwards invites the principal nobles to an entertainment, makes them intoxicated, and in that state covers them with a large curtain, which he fastens to the ground with wooden pegs ; he HAM then sets fire to the palace ; and the nobles, being en¬ veloped in the curtain, perish in the flames. During this transaction he repairs to Fengo’s apartment ; and, taking the sword which lay by the side of his bed, puts his own in its place ; he instantly awakens and informs him, that Hamlet is come to revenge the murder of his father. Fengo starts from his bed, seizes the sword ; but being unable to draw it, falls by the hand of Hamlet. The next morning, when the populace were assembled to view the ruins of the palace, Hamlet snm- mons the remaining nobles 5 and in a masterly speech, which is too long to insert in this place, lays open the motives of his own conduct, proves his uncle to have been the assassin of lus father; and concludes in the fol¬ lowing words: “ Tread upon the ashes of the monster, who, polluting the wife of his murdered brother, join¬ ed incest to parricide } and ruled over you with the most oppressive tyranny. Receive me as the minister of a just revenge, as one who felt for the suflerings of his father and his people. Consider me as the person who has purged the disgrace of his country ; extin¬ guished the infamy of his mother; freed you from the despotism of a monster, whose crimes, if he had lived, would have daily increased, and terminated in your destruction. Acknowledge my services; and if I have deserved it, present me with the crown. Behold in me the author of these advantages : no degenerate person, no parricide; but the rightful successor to the throne, and the pious avenger of a father’s murder. I have rescued you from slavery, restored you to liberty, and re-established your glory : I have destroyed a tyrant, and triumphed over an assassin. The recompense is in your hands : you can estimate the value of my services, and in your virtue I rest my hopes of reward.” This speech [ 239 1 (®) ^ reader will recollect, that straw used formerly to be spread over the floors as an article of great luxury. ° (c) Ihis part stands thus in the English account: “ The counsellor entered secretly into the queene’s cham¬ ber, and there hid himselfe behind the arras, and long before the queene and Hamlet came thither: who being craftie and politique, as soone as he w'as within the chamber, doubting some treason, and fearing if he should speak severely and wisely to his mother touching his secret practises hee should be understood, and by that means intercepted, used his ordinary manner of dissimulation, and began to come (r. crow) like a cocke, beating with his arms (in such manner as cockes used to strike with their wings) upon the hangings of the chambers ; whereby feeling something stirring under them, he cried, Aral! a rat! and presently drawing his sworde, thrust it into the hangings ; which done, he pulled the counsellor (half deade) out by the heels, made an end ef killing him ; and, being slain, cut his body in pieces, which he caused to be boiled, and then cast it into an open vault or privie.” Malone's Supplement, vol. i. p. 357",Aral,"DK,KZ,UK",6,"Denmark,Kazakhstan,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"
"Hamlet soon after his elevation sails to England, and orders a shield to be made on which the principal actions of his life are represented. The king receives him with feigned demonstrations of joy, falsely assures him that his daughter is dead, and recommends him to repair to Scotland as his ambassador, and to pay his addresses to the queen Hermetruda. He gives this in¬ sidious advice with the hopes that Hamlet may perish in the attempt ; as the queen, who was remarkable for her chastity and cruelty, had such an aversion to all proposals of marriage, that not one ol her suitors had escaped falling a sacrifice to her vengeance. Hamlet, in opposition to all difficulties, performs the embassy; and, by the assistance of his shield, which inspires the lady with a favourable opinion of his wisdom and cou¬ rage, obtains her in marriage, and returns with her to England. Informed by the princess to whom he had been betrothed, that her father meditates his assassina¬ tion, Hamlet avoids his fate by wearing armour under his robe ; puts to death the king of England; and sails to Denmark with his two wives, where he is soon afterwards killed in a combat with Vigletus son of IIuric.

In 1647 he attended the king in his confinement at Woodburn, Cavesham, Hampton- Court, and the isle of Wight, where he continued till his majesty’s attendants were again put from him.

"HANDEL, George Frederic, a most eminent master and composer of music, was born at Hall, a city of Upper Saxony in Germany. His father was a phy¬ sician and surgeon of that place, and was upwards of 60 years of age when Handel was born. During his infancy young Handel is said to have amused himself with musical instruments, and to have made consider¬ ably progress before he was seven years of age, without anv instructions. Plis propensity for music at last be¬ came so strong, that his father, who designed him for the study of the civil law, thought proper to forbid him, even at this early period of life, to touch a musi¬ cal instrument, and would suffer none to remain in his house. Notwithstanding this prohibition, however, Handel found means to get a little clavichord privately conveyed to a room in the uppermost story of the house, to which room he constantly stole when the fa¬ mily were asleep *, and thus made such advances in his art, as enabled him to play on the harpsichord. He was first taken notice of by the duke of Saxe Weisen- sels on the following occasion. His father went to pay a visit to another son by a former wife, who was valet de chambre to the duke, and resided at his court",,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"On his return to Hall, Handel was placed under one Zackaw, the organist of the cathedral church *, and our young musician was even then able to supply his master’s place in his absence. At nine years of age he began to compose church-services for voices and instru¬ ments, and continued to compose one such service every week for three years successively. At the age of 14, he far excelled his master, as he himself owned j and he was sent to Berlin, where he had a relation in some place about the court, on whose care and fidelity his parents could rely. The opera was then in a flourish¬ ing condition, being encouraged by the grandfather Handd, of the late king of Prussia, and under the direction ■ ^ ",Berlin,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"of many eminent persons from Italy, among whom were Buononcini and Attilio. Buononcini, being of a haughty disposition, treated Handel with contempt : but Attilio behaved to him with great kindness, and he profited much by his instructions. His abilities soon recommended him to the king, who frequently made him presents, and at last proposed to send him to Italy under his own patronage, and to take him under his immediate protection as soon as his studies should he completed. But Handel’s parents not thinking proper to submit their child to the caprice of the king, declined the offer j upon which it became necessary for him to return to Hall",,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"Handel having now obtained ideas in music far ex¬ celling every thing that could be found in Hall, conti¬ nued there very unwillingly, and it was resolved to senA him to Italy : but as the expence of this journey could not then be spared, he went to Hamburg, where the opera was little inferior to that of Berlin. Soon after his arrival in this city, his father died y and his mother being left in narrow circumstances, her son thought it necessary to procure some scholars, and to accept a place in the orchestra} by which means,, instead of being a burden, he became a great relief to her","Hamburg, Berlin","DE,IT",6,"Germany,Italy","Europe,Europe"
"At this time, the first harpischord in Hamburg was played by one Keser, a man who also excelled in com¬ position } but he, having involved himself in some debts, was obliged to abscond. Upon this vacancy, the per¬ son who had been used to play the second harpsichord claimed the first by right of succession } but was oppo¬ sed by Handel, who founded a claim to the first harpsi¬ chord upon his superior abilities. After much, dispute, in which all who supported or directed the opera en¬ gaged with much vehemence, it was decided in favour of Handel } but this good success had almost cost him his life. His antagonist resented the supposed affront so much, that, as they were coming out of t he orchestra together, he made a push at Handel’s breast with a sword, which must undoubtedly have killed him,, had there not fortunately been a music-book in the bosom of his coat",Hamburg,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"Handeh, though yet but in his 15th year, became composer to the house } and the success of Almeria, his first opera, was so great, that it ran 30 nights without interruption.

During his stay here, which was about four or five years, he al¬ so composed a considerable number of sonatas, which are now lost. Here his abilities procured him the ac¬ quaintance of many persons of note, particularly the prince of Tuscany, brother to John Gaston de Medi- cis the grand duke. This prince pressed him to go with him to Italy, where he assured him that no con¬ venience would be wanting} but this ofler Handel thought proper to decline, being resolved not to give up his independency for any advantage that could be offered him",,IT,6,Italy,Europe

"H A , N [ 245 ] HAN ndel. Juke. His Serene Highness was impatient to have something composed by so great a master; and not¬ withstanding the difference between the style of the Italian music and the German, to which Handel had hitherto been accustomed, he set an opera called Rode- n'go, which pleased so well that he was rewarded with IOO sequins and a service of plate. After staying about a year in Florence, he went to Venice, where he is said to have been first discovered at a masquerade. He was playing on a harpsichord in his visor, when Scarlatti, a famous performer, cried out, that the person who play¬ ed could be none but the famous Saxon or the devil","Florence, Venice","US,IT,DE",6,"United States,Italy,Germany","North America,Europe,Europe"
"From Venice our musician proceeded to Rome, where he became acquainted with Cardinal Ottoboni and many other dignitaries of the church, by which means he was frequently attacked on account of his re¬ ligion ; but Handel declared he would live and die in the religion in which he had been educated, whether it was true or false. Here he composed an oratorio call¬ ed Resurrectione, and 150 cantatas, besides some sona¬ tas, and other music. Ottoboni also contrived to have a trial of skill between him and Dominici Scarlatti, who was considered as the greatest master on that instrument in Italy. The event is differently report¬ ed. Some say that Scarlatti was victorious, and others give the victory to Handel ; but when they came to the organ, Scarlatti himself ascribed the superiority to Handel",Rome,"IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

"At that time operas were a new entertainment in England, and were conducted in a very absurd man¬ ner: but Handel soon pat them on a better footing; and set a drama called Rinaldo, which was performed with uncommon success. Having staid a year in Eng¬ land, he returned to Hanover; but in 171 2 he again came over to England ; and the peace of Utrecht be¬ ing concluded a few months afterwards, he composed a grand Te Deum and Jubilate on the occasion. He now found the nobility very desirous that he should resume Handel, the direction of the opera-house in the Hay-market; 1 ■■ ■-— and the queen having added her authority to their so¬ licitations, and conferred on him a pension of 200I","Hanover, Utrecht","US,NL",6,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"In the year 1715, Handel composed his opera of A- tnadige; but from that time to the year 1720 he com¬ posed only Teseo and Pastor Pi do, Buononcini and At- tilio being then composers for the operas. About this time a project was formed by the nobility for erecting a kind of academy at the Hay Market, with a view to secure to themselves a constant supply of operas to be composed by Handel, and performed under his direc¬ tion. No less than 50,000!. was subscribed for this scheme, of which the king himself subscribed 1000L and it was proposed to continue the undertaking for 14 years. Handel went over to D resden, in order to en¬ gage singers, and returned with Senesino and Duri- stanti. Buononcini and Attilio had still a strong party in their favour, but not equal to that of Handel ; and therefore in 1720 he obtained leave to perform his ope¬ ra of, Radamisto. The house was so crowded, that many fainted through excessive heat ; and 40s. were ofiered by some for a seat in the gallery, after having in vain attempted to get one elsewhere. The contention, how¬ ever, still ran very high between Handel’s party and that of the two Italian masters ; and at last it was de¬ termined that the rivals should be jointly employed in making an opera, in which each should take a distinct act, and he who by the general suffrage was allowed to have given the best proof of his abilities should be put in possession of the house. This opera was called Mu- sio Sccevola, and Handel set the last act. It is said that Handel’s superiority was owned even in the overture before it; but when the act came to be performed, there remained no pretence of doubt or dispute. The academy was now therefore firmly established, and Han¬ del conducted it for nine years with great success ; but about that time an irreconcileable enmity took place between Handel himself and Senesino. Senesino ac¬ cused Handel of tyranny, and Handel accused Senesi¬ no of rebellion. The merits of the quarrel are not known s HAN [ 246 ] HAN Handel, known : the nobility, however, became mediators for  v ' some time j and having failed in that good design, they became parties in the quarrel. Handel was resolved to dismiss Senesino, and the nobility seemed also resol¬ ved not to permit him to do so. The haughtiness of Handel’s temper would not allow him to yield, and the. affair ended in the total dissolution of the aca¬ demy",,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"Handel now found that his abilities, great as they were, could not support him against the powerful op¬ position he met with. After the dismission of Senesino, his audience sensibly dwindled away, and Handel en¬ tered into an agreement with Mr Heidegger to carry on operas in conjunction with him. New singers were engaged from Italy j but the offended nobility raised a subscription against him, to carry on operas in the play¬ house in Liucoln’s-Inn fields. Handel bore up four years against this opposition j three in partnership with Heidegger, and one by himself: but though his mu¬ sical abilities were superior to those of his antagonists, the astonishing powers of the voice of Farinelli, whom the opposite party had engaged, determined the vic¬ tory against him. At last Handel, having spent all he was worth in a fruitless opposition, thought proper to desist. His disappointment had such an effect upon him, that for some time he was disordered in his un¬ derstanding, and at the same time his right arm was rendered useless by a stroke of the palsy. In this deplorable situation, it was thought necessary that he should go to the baths of Aix-la-Chapel!e ; and from them he received such extraordinary and sudden relief, that his cure was looked upon by the nuns as miracu¬ lous",,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"He was received in Ireland in a manner suitable to his great merit j and his performing his oratorio called the Messiah, for the benefit of the city prison, brought him into universal favour. In nine months time he had 3 brought his affairs into a better situation ; and on Ins return to England in 1742, he found the public much more favourably disposed. His oratorios w'ere now per¬ formed with great applause : his Messiah, which before had been but coldly received, became a favourite per¬ formance j and Handel, with a generous humanity, de¬ termined to perform it annually for the benefit of the foundling hospital, which at that time was only sup¬ ported by private benefactions. In 1743> he had a re¬ turn of his paralytic disorder; and in 1751 became quite blind by aguttaserena in his eyes. This last mis¬ fortune for some time sunk him into the deepest de¬ spondency j but at last he was obliged to acquiesce in his situation, after having without any relief undergone some very painful operations. Finding it now impos¬ sible to manage his oratorios alone, he was assisted by Mr Smith, who at his request frequently played for him, and conducted them in his stead ; and with this assistance they were continued till within eight days of his death. During the latter part of his life, his mind was often disordered ; yet at times it appears to have resumed its full vigour, and he composed several songs, choruses, &c. which from their dates may be considered almost as the last sounds of his dying voice",,IE,6,Ireland,Europe

"But guards being posted at these, he could not fly^ though, according to Livy, he attempted it. Pei-r eeiving, therefore, no possibility of escaping, he had recourse to poison, which he had long reserved for such a melancholy occasion. Then taking it in his hand, u Let us (said he) deliver the Romans from the dis¬ quietude with which they have long been tortured, since they have not patience to wait for an old man’s death. Flaminius will not acquire any reputation or glory by a victory gained over a betrayed and defence¬ less person. This single day will be a lasting testimo¬ ny of the degeneracy of the Romans.

"With respect to the character of this general, it appears to have been in military affairs what Demos¬ thenes was in oratory, or Newton in mathematics j namely, absolutely perfect, in which no human wisdom could discover a fault, and to which no man could add a perfection. Rollin hath contrasted his character with that of Scipio Africanus. He enumerates the qualities which make a complete general j and having then given a summary of what historians have related concerning both commanders, is inclined to give the preference to Hannibal. “ There are, however, (be says), two difficulties which hinder him from deciding 5, one drawn from the characters of the generals whom Hannibal vanquished $ the other from the errors he committed. May it not be said (continues our author), that those victories which made Hannibal so famous, were as much owing to the imprudence and temerity of the Roman generals, as to his bravery and skill? When a Fabius and a Scipio were sent against him, the former stopped his progress, the latter conquered him.” These reasons have been answered by Mr Hooke, who bath taken some pains to vindicate Hannibal’s character, by fully and fairly comparing it with that of Scipio Africanus, and other Roman commanders","Newton, Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal, Roman, Hannibal, Roman","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"“ I do not see (says he) why these difficulties should cheek our author’s inclination to declare in favour of the Carthaginian. That Fabius was not beaten by Hannibal, we cannot much wonder, when we remem¬ ber how steadily the old man kept to his resolution never to fight with him. Bu-t from Fabius’s taking this method to put a stop to the victories of the ene- my, may we not conclude that lie knew no other, and thought Hannibal an overmatch for him ? And why does our author forget Publius Scipio (Africanus’s father), a prudent and able general, whom Hannibal vanquished at the Ticin ? Livy relates some victories of Hannibal over the celebrated Marcellas ; but nei¬ ther Marcellas nor any other general ever vanquished Hannibal before the battle of Zama, if we may be¬ lieve Polybius (lib. xv. c. 16.). Terentius Varro, in¬ deed, is represented as a headstrong rash man ; but the battle of Cann?e was not lost by his imprudence. The order Hanniba C E,'. j 111 a HAN [ 251 ] HAN mibal order in wlncli lie drew up his army is nowhere con- (1 demned ; and Chevalier Folard thinks it excellent, over. And as to the conduct of the battle, ^Flmilius Paulas, a renowned captain, and a disciple of Fabius, had a greater share in it than his colleague. The imprudence with which Varro is taxed, was his venturing, contrary to his colleague’s advice, with above 90,000 men, to en¬ counter in a plain field an enemy who had only 50,000, but was superior in horse. And does not the very advice ofiEmilius, and the charge of temerity on Varro for not following it, imply a confession of Hannibal’s superio¬ rity in military skill over ^Emilius as well as Varro ? It ought likewise to be observed, that Hannibal’s inr fantry had gained the victory over the Roman infan¬ try, before this latter suffered any thing from the Car¬ thaginian cavalry. It was otherwise when Scipio gained the victory at Zama. His infantry would pro¬ bably have been vanquished but for his cavalry. Han¬ nibal, with only his third line of foot (bis Italian army), maintained a long fight against Scipio’s three lines of foot ; and seems to have had the advantage over them, when Masinissa and Laelius, with the horse, came to their assistance. Polybius indeed says, that Hannibal’s Italian forces were equal in number to all Scipio’s in¬ fantry $ but this is contradicted by Ljvy, and is not very probable. The authority of Polybius, who was an intimate friend of Scipio ZEmilianus, is, I imagine, of little weight in matters where the glory of the Scipios is particularly concerned. His partiality and flattery to them are, in many instances, but too vi¬ sible.” Our author then proceeds to show, that Hannibal was not guilty of any of the faults laid to his charge as a general j and having contrasted the moral cha¬ racters of the two generals with each other, makes it evident, that as a man, as well as a general, Hannibal had greatly the advantage of his rival.

This new creation met with great opposition both in the electoral college and the col¬ lege of princes: at last, by a conclusion of the three colleges on the 30th of January 1708, it was unani¬ mously determined, that the electoral dignity should be confirmed to the duke of Hanover and his heirs male j but it was added, that if, while that electoral dignity subsisted, the Palatine electorate should happen to fall into the hands of a Protestant prince, the first Catholic elector should have a supernumerary vote","Roman, Hanover, Palatine","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"

"Another accident that happened to their mortifica¬ tion was while Queen Elizabeth was at war with the Spaniards. Sir Francis Drake happening to meet 60 ships in the Tagus, loaded with corn belonging to the hanse-towns, took out all the corn as contraband goods, which they were forbidden to carry by their original patent. The hanse-towns having complained of this to the diet of the empire, the queen sent an ambassador thither to declare her reasons. The king of Poland likewise interested himself in the affair, because the city of Dantzic wTas under his protection. At last, though the queen strove hard to preserve the commerce of the English in Germany, the emperor excluded the Eng¬ lish company of merchant-adventurers, who had con¬ siderable factories at Stade, Embden, Bremen, Ham¬ burgh, and Elbing, from all trade in the empire. In short, the hanse-towns, in Germany in particular, were not only in so flourishing, but in so formidable a state, from the 14th to the 16th century, that they gave umbrage to all the neighbouring princes, who threaten¬ ed a strong confederacy against them ; and, as the first step towards it, commanded all the cities within their dominion or jurisdiction to withdraw from the union or hanse, and be no farther concerned therein. This im¬ mediately separated all the cities of England, I ranee, and Italy, from them. The hanse, on the other hand, prudently put themselves under the protection of the empire •, and as the cities just now mentioned had with¬ drawn from them j so they withdrew from several more, and made a decree among themselves, that none should be admitted into their society but such as stood within the limits of the German empire, or were dependent thereon : except Dantzic, which continued a member, though in nowise dependent on the empire, only it had been summoned formerly to the imperial diet. By this means they maintained their confederacy for the protec¬ tion of their trade, as it was begun, without being any more envied by their neighbours. Hereby likewise they were reduced to Lubec, Bremen, Hamburgh, and Dantzic ; in the first of which they kept their register, and held assemblies once in three years at least.

He was deprived of his life by an acci¬ dent ; and left his widow with four children, Jonas, William, Thomas, and Elizabeth, all ol a very tender age. Mrs Hanway coming to London after the death of her husband, put Jonas to school, where he learned writing and accounts, and made some proficiency in Latin.

"This had alarmed the merchants in the Russian trade, and a resolution was formed that one of their body should make a journey into Persia. On this occasion Mr Hanway offered his service, and was accepted",,RU,6,Russian Federation,Europe
"He set out on the 10th of September; and after ex¬ periencing a variety of hazards in that kingdom du¬ ring a course of 12 months, returned to St Petersburgh January 1. 1745, without being able to establish the intended trade by the Caspian, partly through the jealousy of the Russian court on account of EltoiPs connections with the Persians, and partly by the troubles and revolutions of the latter kingdom",,RU,6,Russian Federation,Europe
"During this time he interested himself greatly in the concerns of the merchants who had engaged in the Caspian trade : but the independence he had acquired having excited a desire to see his native country, he, after several disappointments which prevented him from accomplishing his wish, left St Petersburgh on the 9th of July 1750. On his arrival in his native country, he did not immediately relinquish his mercantile con¬ nections, though he seems to have left Russia with that view. He employed himself some time as a merchant; but afterwards, more beneficially to the world, as a private gentleman. In 1753 i,e published “ An Historical Account of the British trade over the Caspian sea; with a Journal of Travels Irom Lon¬ don through Russia into Persia; and back again through Russia, Germany, and Holland.

"At this juncture, Great Britain being on the eve of a war with France, the event of which was very important to the nation at large, and required every effort of patriotism and prudence to ward off the im¬ pending danger, Mr Hanway published “ Thoughts on the Duty of a good Citizen with regard to War and Invasion, in a Letter from a Citizen to his Friend,” 8vo. About the same time, several gentlemen form¬ ed a plan which was matured and made perfect by the assiduity of Mr Hanway, for providing the navy with sailors, by furnishing poor children with necessa¬ ries to equip them for the service of their country",,FR,6,France,Europe
"In 1759, Mr Hamvay wrote “ Reasons for an Aug¬ mentation of at least Twelve Thousand Mariners, to be employed in the Merchants Service and Coasting Trade, in 33 Letters to Charles Gray, Esq. of Colchester, 4to.” The next year he published several performances, viz. I. “ A candid historical Account of the Hospital for the reception of exposed and deserted young Chil¬ dren *, representing the present Plan of it as productive of many Evils, and not adapted to the Genius and Happiness of this Nation,” 8vo j which being answer- ed by an anonymous Letter from Halifax in “ Candid Remarks, 8vo 1760,” Mr Hanway replied to it, and the Remarker rejoined. 2. “ An Account of the So- city for the Encouragement of the British Troops in Germany and North America, fee.” 8vo. 3. “ Eight Letters to Duke of , on the Custom of Vails giving in England,” 8vo. This practice of giving vails had arrived at a very extravagant pitch, especial¬ ly among the servants of the great. It was Mr Han¬ way who answered the kind reproach of a friend in a high station for not coming oftener to dine with him, by saying, “Indeed I cannot afford it.” The Hanv nobleman to whom the above letters were addressed -y was the duke of Newcastle. The letters are written in that humorous style which is most attractive of ge¬ neral notice, and vva^ best adapted to the subject. It was Sir Timothy Waldo that first put Mr Hanway on this plan. Sir Timothy had dined with the duke of N , and, on his leaving the house, was contributing to the support and insolence of a train of servants who lined the hall ; and at last put a crown into the hand of the cook, who returned it, saying, “ Sir, I do not take silver.”—“ Don’t you indeed !” said the worthy ba¬ ronet, putting it in his pocket: “ then I do not give gold.” Among the ludicrous circumstances in Mr Hanway’s letters is one which happened to himself H e was paying the servants of a respectable friend for a dinner which their master had invited him to, one by one as they appeared j “ Sir, yopr great coat j” a shilling —“ Your hat $” a shilling—“ Stick j” a shilling  “ Umbrella 5” a shilling—” Sir, your gloves “ Why, friend, you may keep the gloves ; they are not worth a shilling.” In 1761, Mr Hanway produ¬ ced “ Reflections, Essays, and Meditations on Life and Religion j with a collection of Proverbs, and 18 Let¬ ters written occasionally on several subjects,” in 2 vols 8vo","Colchester, Halifax, Newcastle","DE,US,GB,ZA",6,"Germany,United States,United Kingdom,South Africa","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa"
"The many useful and public-spirited plans which Mr Hanway had promoted for the welfare of the communi¬ ty, had now rendered his character most respectably popular, while his disinterestedness, and the sincerity of his intentions, were conspicuous to all. Five citizens of London, of whom Mr Hoare the banker was one, waited on Lord Bute, at that time the minister : and, in their own names, and in the names of their fellow- citizens, requested that some notice might be taken of a man, who, at the expence of his own private fortune, and unremitting application, had rendered so many and such meritorious services to his country. In consequence of this request, he was in July 1762 appointed by a patent one of the commissioners for victualling the navy; a post which he held above 21 years. The next act of public beneficence in which we find him engaged is the collection of money for the sufferers by the fire which happened at Montreal, in the province of Quebec, in May 1765, when a fourth part of the city was consumed",London,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

As it was frequently neces¬ sary for him to appear in polite circles on unexpected occasions, lie usually wore dress clothes, with a large French bag. His bat, ornamented with a gold button, was ot a size and fashion to be worn as well under the aim as on the head. When it rained, a small parapluie defended his face and wig.

But by leaving bis work to transact Ins ordinary business, and afterwards recurring to it with new ideas, all his literary labours are defective in the arrangement of the matter, and appear to have too much of the miscellaneous in tiieir composition. The original idea is sometimes left in the pursuit of one newly started, and either taken up again when the mind of the reader has almost lost it, or it is totally deserted. Yet those who are judges of literary composition say, that his language is well calculated to have the effect he desired on the reader, and impress him with the idea that the author was a man of inflexible integrity, and wrote from the pure dictates of the heart.

The natives take this op¬ portunity of the extreme dryness of the grass and young trees to set fire to them, especially near their roads, not only to keep those roads open to travellers, but to destroy the shelter which long grass, and thickets of young trees, would afford to skulking parties of their enemies. A fire thus lighted flies with such rapidity, as to endanger those who travel: in that situation, a common method ol escape is, on discovering a fire to windward, to set the grass on fire to leeward, and * then follow your own fire.

This cir¬ cumstance, however, might encourage the belief, that as Cadmus brought letters into Greece, his wife brought harmony thither; as the word harnio* nitty has been said to have no other derivation than from her name : which makes it very difficult to ascertain the sense in which the Greeks made use of it in their music * ; for it has no roots by which it can he decom-^ - .",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

In the ancient treatises which remain to us, harmony appears to be that department whose object is the agreeable suc¬ cession of sounds, merely considered as high or low j in opposition to the two others called rhylhmica and metric"", which have their principle in time and mea¬ sure. This leaves our ideas concerning that aptitude of sound vague and undetermined ; nor can we fix them without studying for that purpose all the rules of the art; and even after we have done so, it will be very difficult to distinguish harmony from melody, unless we add to the last the ideas of rhythmus and mea¬ sure ; without which, in reality, no melody can have a distinguishing character: whereas harmony is cha¬ racterised by its own nature, independent of all other quantities except the chords or intervals which com¬ pose it",,IE,6,Ireland,Europe

Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of the privy- chamber extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great fidelity, and made use of his inte¬ rest with his friends in parliament to procure matters to be accommodated with all parties. The king loved his company except when the conversation happened to turn upon commonwealths. He found means to see the king at St James’s ; and attended him on the gcaflold, H A R [ 279 ] H A R Hi ngton, scaffold, where, or a little before, lie received a token l I of his majesty’s affection. After the death of King * J Charles, he wrote his Oceana; a kind ot political ro¬ mance, in imitation of Plato’s Commonwealth, which he dedicated to Oliver Cromwell.

This work was attacked by several writers, against whom he defended it. Beside his writings to promote republican principles, he in¬ stituted likewise a nightly meeting of several ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard, Westminster j which dub was called the Rota, and continued till the se¬ cluded members of parliament were restored by Ge¬ neral Monk.

"Harrison, John, an ingenious mechanic, the cele¬ brated inventor of the famous time-keeper for ascertain¬ ing the longitude at sea, and also of the compound, or, as it is commonly called, the gridiron-pendulum ; was born at Foulby, in the parish of Wragby, near Pontefract in Yorkshire, in 1693. The vigour of his Harrisoi natural abilities, if not even strengthened by the want of education, which confined his attention to few ob¬ jects, at least amply compensated the deficiencies of it 5 as fully appeared from the astonishing progress he made in that branch of mechanics to which he de¬ voted himself. His father was a carpenter, in which profession the son assisted •, occasionally also, according to the miscellaneous practice of country artists, sur¬ veying land, and repairing clocks and watches. Hs was, from his early childhood, attached to any ma¬ chinery moving by wheels, as appeared while he lay sick of the small pox about the sixth year of his age, when he had a watch placed open upon his pillow to amuse himself by contemplating the movement. In 1700, he removed with his lather to Barrow in Lin¬ colnshire $ where though his opportunities of acquiring knowledge were very few, he eagerly improved every incident from which he might collect information ; fre¬ quently employing all or great part of his nights in wri¬ ting or drawing : and he always acknowledged his obli¬ gations to a clergyman who came every Sunday to offi¬ ciate in the neighbourhood, who lent him a MS. copy of Professor Saunderson’s Lectures; which he carefully and neatly transcribed, with all the diagrams. His na¬ tive genius exerted itself superior to these solitary dis¬ advantages ; for in the year 1726, he had constructed two clocks, mostly of wood, in which he applied the escapement and compound pendulum of his own inven¬ tion : these surpassed every thing then made, scarcely erring a second in a month. In 1728, he came up to London with the drawings of a machine for deter¬ mining the longitude at sea, in expectation of being enabled to execute one by the board of longitude","Harrison, Pontefract, London","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Upon application to Dr Halley, he referred him to Mr George Graham; who, discovering he had un¬ common merit, advised him to make his machine be¬ fore he applied to the board of longitude. He re¬ turned home to perform this task ; and in 1735 came to London again with his first machine ; with which he was sent to Lisbon the next year for a trial of its properties. In this short voyage, he corrected the dead reckoning about a degree and a half; a success that proved the means of his receiving both public and private encouragement. About the year I739> he completed his second machine, of a construction much more simple than the former, and which an¬ swered much better; this, though not sent to sea, recommended Mr Harrison yet stronger to the pa¬ tronage of his private friends and of the public","Graham, London, Lisbon","US,GB,PT",6,"United States,United Kingdom,Portugal","North America,Europe,Europe"

"HATTEMISTS, in ecclesiastical history, the name of a modern Dutch sect, so called from Pontian Van Hattem, a minister in the province of Zealand, to¬ wards the close of the 17th century, who being addicted to the sentiments of Spinoza, was on that account de¬ graded from his pastoral office. The Verschorists and Hattemists resemble each other in their religious sy¬ stems, though they never so entirely agreed as to form one communion. The founders of these sects deduced from the doctrine of absolute decrees a system of fatal and uncontrollable necessity j they denied the difi’er- euce between moral good and evil, and the corruption of human nature: from hence they farther concluded, that mankind were under no sort of obligation to cor¬ rect their manners, to improve their minds, or to obey the divine laws j that the whole of religion consisted not in acting, but in suffering j and that all the pre¬ cepts of Jesus Christ are reducible to this one, that we bear with cheerfulness and patience the events that happen to us through the divine will, and make it our constant and only study to maintain a permanent tran¬ quillity of mind. Thus far they agreed ; but the Hat¬ temists farther affirmed, that Christ made no expiation for the sins of men by his death, but had only suggest¬ ed to us by his mediation, that there was nothing in us that could offend the Deity; this, they say, was Christ’s manner of justifying his servants, and presenting them blameless before the tribunal of God. It was one of their distinguished tenets, that God does not punish men for their sins, but by their sins.

"HA V ANNA, a sea-port town in the island of Cuba, in the West Indies, and on the north-west part of it, op¬ posite to Florida. It is famous for its harbour, which is in eveiy respect one of the best in the West In¬ dies, and perhaps in the world. It is entered by a narrow passage, upwards of half a mile in length, which afterwards expands into a large bason, forming three cul de sacs, and is sufficient, in extent and depth, to contain 1000 sail of the largest ships, having almost throughout six fathoms water, and being perfectly co¬ vered from every wind. The town was built by Diego de Velasquez, who conquered the island of Cuba. It was but a small place, and named originally the port of Carenas; A ir H A V C 293 ] H A V jja ,imi( Carenas; but afterwards, wlien the city by its increase of wealth grew considerable, it was called St Christo¬ pher of the Havanna. In 1536, it was of so inconsi¬ derable a value, that being taken by a French pirate, he ransomed the place for the piltry sum of 700 pieces of eight. Some time after it was taken by the English, and a second time by the French : nor was its value understood, nor any care taken to put it in a posture of defence, till the reign of Philip II.; though what was then done proved insufficient. But since the acces¬ sion of a branch of the house of Bourbon to the Spa¬ nish crown, more pains have been taken to render it a place of strength",Florida,"CU,FR,UY,UK",6,"Cuba,France,Uruguay,N/A","North America,Europe,South America,N/A"
"The churches are rich and magnificent"", the lamps, candlesticks, and ornaments for the altars, being of gold and silver"", some of the lamps are of the most cu¬ rious workmanship, and weigh near 100 weight. The Recollects church, which stands on the best ground in the city, has 12 beautiful chapels in it, and in the mo¬ nastery are cells for 50 fathers. The church of St Clara has seven altars adorned with plate, and the nunnery con¬ tains 100 women and servants, all clothed in blue. The church belonging to the Augustines has 13 altars •, that of St Juan de Dios 9, with an hospital for soldiers of 12,000 pieces of eight revenue. It is not a bishop’s see, though the bishop of St Jago resides here, the re¬ venue of which prelate is not less than 50,000 pieces of eight a-year. In 1700 the inhabitants were computed at 26,000, and we may very well imagine them to be increased since. They are a more polite and social people than the inhabitants of any of the Spanish ports on the continent j and of late imitate the French both in their dress and manners. The city is supplied with water by a small river called Lagicla, which rises from the hills on the south-west side of the town, and divides itself into three streams, one of which falls into the sea on the east side of the town, but the other two flow through the place, entering the walls near the middle of the city",,"ES,FR",6,"Spain,France","Europe,Europe"
"the bastions of the town, next the harbour, are a num- ber ot cannon ; and about the middle of the city is another lorf, called El Puerto, a square fort with four bastions, mounted with 22 pieces of cannon, of no great strength ; but in this last the governor resides, and in it the king of Spain’s treasures are deposited till the arrival of the galleons. On the land-side, from the I imta gate to the dock-yard, there is a rampart with bastions, faced with stone, and earthen parapets with a ditch, which in several places has fallen in, and is almost filled up, particularly behind the Punta and land-gates, near the stone quarries, which, if joined to one another, might be of great detriment to the place in case of a siege, as a lodgement might be made in them. The ground here rises with an easy ascent to the land-gate ; and is either open pasture or garden ground, well sto¬ red with the cabbage-tree. Before the land-gate is a ravelin.

"The Havanna has greatly contributed to the mari¬ time strength of the crown of Spain, many ships ha¬ ving been built here within these few years, from 60 to 80 guns, the island furnishing the finest materials, such as oak, pine, cedar, and mahogany. The only defect of the harbour is the narrowness of its entry j for though free from bars and shoals, yet only one ship at a time can enter it; from which circumstance the galleons have more than once been insulted, and some of them taken, at the mouth of the harbour, the forts there not being able to alford them any assistance",,ES,6,Spain,Europe
"Upon the rupture with Spain in 1762, the British ministry sent a squadron and army against this place, under HAY [ 294 ] H A U Haraona, under the command of Admiral Pocock and Lord Albe- ~~v'   marie. The Spaniards had in the harbour at the time a fleet of twelve sail of the line, two of them but just launched, two more on the stocks nearly finished, and several merchant ships. The men of war were almost ready for sea j but no account had reached the gover¬ nor of the intended attack. The place, however, was gallantly defended, and sustained a siege of two months and eight days before it could be reduced ; Avhen a capitulation was signed, and alongst with the city was yielded a district of 180 miles to the westward. This conquest was without doubt in itself the most consider¬ able, and in its consequences the most decisive, of any we had made since the beginning of the war ; and in no operation were the courage, steadiness, and perse¬ verance of the British troops, and the conduct of their leaders, more conspicuous. The acquisition of this place united in itself all the advantages which can be acquired in war. It was a military achievement of the highest class. By its effect on the enemy’s marine it was equal to the greatest naval victory, and in the plunder it equalled the produce of a national subsidy",,"GB,ES",6,"United Kingdom,Spain","Europe,Europe"
"Nine sail of the enemy’s line-of-battle ships were ta¬ ken ; three of their capital ships had been sunk by themselves at the beginning of the siege $ two more were in forwardness upon the stocks, and were after¬ wards destroyed by the captors. The enemy on this occasion lost a whole fleet of ships of war, besides a number of considerable merchant ships ; and in ready money, in tobacco collected at the Havanna on account of the king of Spain, and in other valuable merchan¬ dises, the sum lost by the enemy perhaps did not fall short of three millions sterling",,ES,6,Spain,Europe

"Here the navy of Spain stationed in the West Indies ride ; and here the galleons, the flota, and other mer¬ chant ships from other ports both of the continent and islands, meet in September, to take in provisions and water, with great part of their lading, and for the convenience of returning to Spain in a body. A con¬ tinual fair is held till their departure, which generally happens before the end of the month, when proclama¬ tion is made, forbidding any person belonging to the fleet to stay in town on pain of death ; and accordingly, on firing the warning gun, they all retire on board.— The commerce carried on in this port, which is very considerable ; may be distinguished into the particular commerce of the island of Cuba, and that more general by the galleons and flota. The former consists in hides, usually styled of the Havanna, which are excel¬ lent, and of great value •, sugar, tobacco, admirable in its kind, &c. Though strangers are prohibited to trade, yet a contraband commerce is carried on brisker here than at Vera Cruz. Some little trade is car¬ ried on by other ports of Cuba, but it is very incon¬ siderable. As to the general commerce, this port is the place of rendezvous (as already mentioned) for all ships, particularly from Carthagena, Puerto Velo, and La Vera Cruz, which return to Spain from the Indies",Vera Cruz,"ES,CU,BR",6,"Spain,Cuba,Brazil","Europe,North America,South America"
"The Havanna is regularly supplied with European goods only by the register ships from Cadiz and the Canaries. The flota and galleons bring there no more Harai than the refuse of their cargoes, which they had not [| been able to dispose of at Carthagena, Puerto Velo, or ^au La Vera Cruz. When the fleet is in the harbour, 'r; provisions are excessively dear on shore, and money so plenty, that a Spaniard expects half a piece of eight a-day from a male slave, and a quarter from a female, out of what they earn for their labour. The fleet ge¬ nerally sails from thence, through the channel of Ba¬ hama, in the month of September ; and is the richest in the world j since, in silver and merchandise, there is seldom less than thirty millions of pieces of eight on board, or six millions seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of our money.—-It is natural to imagine, that a port of so much consequence as the Havanna ought to be well fortified.

These am t mis add, that what we call the Samaritan character, is t le genuine ancient Hebrew. Of this opinion are ocanger, Bochart, Casaubon, Vossius, Grotius, Wal¬ ton, Capellus, &c. and among the ancients Jerome and Eusebius. On this side it is urged, that the present characters are called Assyrian by the ancient Jewish waters of the Talmud, and therefore must have been roug it fiom Assyria: but to this argument it is re- pued, that there were two sorts of characters anciently in use, viz. the sacred or present square character, and the profane or civil, which we call Samaritan ; and t lat the sacred is called Assyrian, because it first began m Assyria to come into common use. It is farther al¬ leged, H E B [ : liiiew. Ifgetl, tliat the Chaldee letters, which the Jews now l—’ use, were unknown to the ancient Jews before the cap¬ tivity, from Dan. i. 4. Moreover, it is inferred from 2 Kings xvii. 28. whence we learn that a Jewish priest was sent to teach the Samaritans the worship of Jeho¬ vah ; on which occasion he must have taught them the law ; and yet no mention occurs of his teaching them the language or character that the law was then written in, the character which the Samaritans used. But the chief argument is taken from some ancient Jewish she¬ kels, with a legend on one side “ The shekel of Israel,” and on the other “ Jerusalem the holy,” both in Sama¬ ritan characters. These shekels, it is said, must have been coined before the division of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel, or at least before the Assyrian capti¬ vity, because the Samaritans never afterwards reckoned Jerusalem holy. On the other side, or for the primi¬ tive antiquity of the square character, are the two Bux- torls, Leusden, Calovius, Hottinger, Spanheim, Light- foot, &c. They urge, from Matthew v, 18. that jod is really the least of the consonants in the present He¬ brew, whereas it is one of the largest characters in the Samaritan alphabet: but Walton replies, that if our Saviour here speaks of the least letter of the alphabet, we can only infer, that the Chaldee character was used in our Saviour’s time, which is not denied by those who maintain the Samaritan to be the original. They also allege, that the Jews were loo obstinate and super¬ stitious to allow their sacred character to be altered ; Lot if this was done under the direction and authority of Ezra, the argument will be much invalidated. Far¬ ther, they say, that Ezra could not alter the ancient character, because it was impossible to make the alte¬ rations in all their copies. This argument, however, is contradicted by fact; since the old English black let¬ ter is actually changed for the Roman. They say, like¬ wise, that Ezra was not disposed to profane the sacred writings with a heathen character : but this supposes that Ezra was so superstitious as to imagine, that there was some peculiar sanctity in the shape of the letters","Of, Jerusalem, Sama, Jerusalem, Leusden, Roman","IL,TR,ES,NL,RO,UK",6,"Israel,Turkey,Spain,Netherlands,Romania,N/A","Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"2. The modern, or rabbinical, is a good neat cha¬ racter, formed of the square Hebrew, by rounding it, and retrenching most of the angles or corners of the letters, to make it the more easy and flowing. The letters used by the Germans are very different from the rabbinical character used everywhere else, though all formed alike from the square character, by the German in a more slovenly manner than the rest.—The rabbins frequently make use either of their own, or the square Hebrew character, to write the modern languages in",,DE,6,Germany,Europe

Having had an opportunity of visiting the principal cities of Europe, he acquired a taste for ele¬ gant and refined pleasures, as they are called, which, united to a strong inclination for voluptuousness, by de¬ grees qualified him for the management of public amuse¬ ments. In 1708, when he was near 50 years old, he came to England on a negociation from the Swiss at Zurich ; but, failing in his embassy, he entered as a private soldier in the guards for protection. By his sprightly engaging conversation and insinuating address, he soon worked himself into the good graces of our young people of fashion ; from whom he obtained the appellation of the Swiss Count. He had the address to procure a subscription, with which, in iyop, he Was enabled to furnish out the opera of “ Thomyris,” which was written in English, and performed at the queen’s theatre in the Haymarket. The music, how¬ ever, was Italian; that is to say, airs selected from sun¬ dry of the foreign operas by Bunoncini, Scarlatti, Stef- fani, Gasparini, and Albinoni. Heidegger by this per¬ formance alone was a gainer of 500 guineas. The ju¬ dicious remarks he made on several defects in the con¬ duct of our operas in general, and the hints he threw out for improving the entertainments of the royal thea¬ tre, soon established his character as a good critic. Ap¬ peals were made to his judgment; and some very mag¬ nificent and elegant decorations introduced upon the stage in consequence of his advice, gave such satisfac¬ tion to George II. who was fond of operas, that, upon being informed to whose genius he was indebted for these improvements, his majesty was pleased from that time to countenance him, and he soon obtained the chief 19 ] HE! management of the opera-house in the Haymarket.

The nobility now caressed him so much, and had such an opinion of his taste, that all splendid and ele¬ gant entertainments given by them upon particular oc¬ casions, and all private assemblies by subscriptions, were submitted to his direction. From the emoluments of these several employments, he gained a regular consi¬ derable income, amounting, it is said, in some years, to 5000!. which he spent with much liberality, parti¬ cularly in the maintenance of a somewhat too luxurious table ; so that it may he said he raised an income, but never a fortune.

"HEINECCIUS, John GotliEB, one of the great¬ est civilians of the 18th century, was born at Eisenberg, in the principality of Altenburg, in 1681. After ha¬ ving studied at Goslar and Leipsic, he was designed for the ministry, and began to preach ; but disliking that profession, he laid it aside, and applied himself entirely to the study of philosophy and the civil law. In 1710, he became professor of philosophy at Hall j and in 1721, he was made professor of civil law, with the title of counsellor of the court. His great reputation made the states of Friesland invite him to Franeker in * 724 j but three years after, the king of Prussia prevailed on him to accept of a professorship of law at Francfort on the Oder, where he distinguished himself till the year 1733. Becoming again professor at Hall, he remained there till his death, which happened in I74T» notwith¬ standing his being invited to Marpurg, Denmark, and three academies in Holland. He wrote many works, all of them much esteemed. The principal are, 1. An- tiquitatum Romanarum jurisprudentiam illustrantium syntagma.

(heron, sacred to Apollo and the muses, who are thence called Heliconides. It is situated in Livadia, and now called Zagura or Zaguya.—Helicon was one of the most fertile and woody mountains in Greece. On it the fruit of the adrachnus, a species of the arbutus or cf the strawberry-tree, was uncommonly sweet ; and the inhabitants affirmed, that the plants and roots were all friendly to man, and that even the serpents had their poison weakened by the innoxious qualities of their food. It approached Parnassus on the north, where it touched on Phocis ; and resembled that mountain in loftiness, extent, and magnitude Here was the shady grove of the muses and their images ; with statues of Apollo and Bacchus, of Linus and Orpheus, and the illustrious poets who had recited their verses to the harp. Among the tripods, in the second century, was that consecrated by Hesiod. On the left hand going to the grove was the fountain Aganippe j and about twenty stadia, or two miles and -a half, higher up, the violet-coloured Hippocrene. Round the grove were houses. A festival was celebrated there by the Thes- pieans with games called Musea. ^Ihe valleys of He¬ licon are described by Wheler as green and flowery in the spring 5 and enlivened by pleasing cascades and streams, and by fountains and wells of clear water",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

"■'Y'""—-' Among the moderns, Mr Whiston advanced a new hypothesis. According to him, the comets are so many hells appointed in their orbits alternately to car¬ ry the damned into the confines of the sun, there to be scorched by its violent heat, and then to return with them beyond the orb of Saturn, there to starve them in those cold and dismal regions. Another mo¬ dern author, not satisfied with any hypothesis hitherto advanced, assigns the sun to be the local hell. 2. As to the second question, viz,, the duration of hell tor¬ ments, we have Origen again at the head of those who deny that they are eternal ; it being that father’s opinion, that not only men but devils, after a due course of punishment suitable to their respective crimes, shall be pardoned and restored to heaven. The chief principle upon which Origen built his opinion, was the nature of punishment, which he took, to be emenda- tory, applied only as physic for the recovery of the patient’s health. The chief objection to the eternity of hell torments among modern writers, is the dispro¬ portion between temporary crimes and eternal pu¬ nishments. Those who maintain the affirmative, ground their opinions on Scripture accounts, which represent the pains of hell under the figure of a worm which never dies, and a fire which is not quenched j as also upon the words, “ These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.” HELANICUS of Mitylene, a celebrated Greek historian, born before Herodotus, flourished about 480 B.

"These relations have been multiplied and prodigiously increased with respect to the marvellous, whenever the figure, the colour, or smell of the animal have any thing extraordinary or forbidding in them, as is the case with the sea-hare. Hence we find a long list of noxious and astonishing properties attributed to this animal. Not only are its flesh, and the water in which it has been steeped, of a poisonous nature, but even its very aspect is deadly. A woman who would wish to conceal her pregnancy, cannot resist the sight of a fe¬ male sea-hare, which produces nausea and vomiting, and finally miscarriage, unless a male of the same spe¬ cies, dried and salted, is given her to eat; for it is one of the superstitious ideas entertained by the common people in most countries, that every noxious species of animal carries within itself a remedy for the ill effects which it may occasion. It happens, indeed, unfortu¬ nately for the present story, that in the sea-hare there is no distinction of sex. If these animals in Italy (for the above stories are taken from Pliny) are so deadly to mankind, it is quite otherwise in the Indian seas ; for there it is man who is such a deadly foe to the sea- hare, that he cannot take it alive, since it is destroved by his very touch ! These ridiculous fables respecting an innocent ani¬ mal, are still believed by many people, and others as ridiculous have been added to them.

"The first literary performance of M. Helvetius was of the poetical kind, consisting of epistles on happiness, but these were not communicated to the public till alter his decease. When read in private, however, they were very much admired, and Voltaire considered them as a strong proof of the didactic and philosophical powers of their author. When the Id Esprit des Zo/.r of Montesquieu appeared in public, it was studied by Hel¬ vetius with the utmost care and attention, and his only fault to it was, that it did not contain the first ideas of the things of which it professed to treat. Instead of examining systems of legislation, and comparing them with each other, Helvetius was of opinion, that the nature of man should be first studied, and the laws for governing him founded on his own nature. This was true philosophy, and such ideas determined him to un¬ dertake a work which might supply what he conceived to he defects in the publication of Montesquieu. In the year 175^ work made its appearance, under the title of De PEsprit, &c. which was condemned by the pailiament of Paris, because it was considered as degrading the nature of man $ but this impolitic me¬ thod of suppressing his labours made them sought for with avidity all over France, as well as other European countries, and gave them more importance than per¬ haps they would have otherwise acquired",Paris,"FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"The usual height of the plant when growing is from five to six feet, but this varies very considerably ac¬ cording to circumstances. I hat which is cultivated near Bischwiller in Alsace is sometimes more than 12 feet high, and upwards of three inches in circumfe¬ rence, the stalks being so deeply rooted that a very strong man can scarce pull them up. Mr Arthur Young, in a tour through Catalonia in Spain, says, that where the country is well watered, the crops of hemp are extraordinary j and that the plants generally rise to the height of seven feet. In Italy hemp is generally cultivated, though the Bolognese only can pretend to anv superiority in the management of it. It is there sown upon their best lands, which are rich strong loams j and on which they are at all possible pains to procure a fine friable surface. For manure they use dung, pieces of rotten cloth, feathers, and horns brought from Dalmatia. The plant, however, may be cultivated upon ground of every kind ; the poorer land produ¬ cing that which is finer in quality though in smaller quantity*, whereas strong and rich land produces a gieat quantity hut coarser. It does not exhaust the land on which it grows like flax ; whence it is pro¬ bable, that if properly managed, and care taken in the cultivation, it might be found to supersede flax en¬ tirely. A Sussex manufacturer, who writes on this subject in the Annals of Agriculture, informs us, that it may be raised for many years successively on the same ground, provided it be well manured.

He early discovered a sprightly benevolent disposition, and his penetration and aptness soon distinguished itself by the success of his studies. Claude de Lisle, father of the celebrated geographer, gave him the same lessons in geography and history which he had before given to the duke of Orleans, afterwards regent; and which have been printed in seven volumes, under the title of “ Abridgement of Universal History.” On quitting college, Henault entered the Oratory, where he soon attached himself to the study of eloquence; and, on the death of the abbe Rene, reformer of La Trappe, he undertook to pronounce his panegyric ; which not meet- HEN [ 374 ] HEN ilennult. ^,e approbation of Father Massilon, he quitted the  ^...

"He associated with the wits till the dispute between Rousseau and de la Motte soon gave him a disgust for these trifling societies. In 1707, he gained the prize of eloquence at the French academy ; and another next year at the academy des Jeux Floraux. About this time M. Reaumur, who was his relation, came to Paris, and took lessons in geometry under the same master, Guinee. Henault introduced him to the abbe Bignon, and this was the first step of his illustrious course. In 1713 he brought a tragedy on the stage, under the dis¬ guised name of Fuselier. As he was known to the pub¬ lic only by some slighter pieces, “ Cornelia the Vestal” met with no better success. He therefore locked it up without printing. In his old age his passion for these subjects reviving, and Mr Horace Walpole being at Paris in 1768, and having formed a friendship with him as one of the most amiable men of his nation, obtained this piece, and had it printed at his own press. In 1751 M. Henault, under a borrowed name, brought out a second tragedy, infilled, “ Marius,” which was well received and printed. He had been admitted counsel¬ lor in parliament in 1706, with a dispensation on ac¬ count of age; and in 1710 president of the first cham¬ ber of inquests. These important places, which he de¬ termined to fill in a becoming manner, engaged him in the most solid studies. The excelhnt work of M. Do- mat charmed him, and made him eager to go back to the fountain head.

"de Morville, procureur-general of the great council, being appointed ambassador to the Hague in 1718, en¬ gaged M. Henault to accompany him. His personal merit soon introduced him to the acquaintance of the most eminent personages at that time there. The grand pensionary, Heinsius, who, under the exterior of Lace¬ daemonian simplicity, kept up all the haughtiness of that people, lost with him all that hauteur winch France it¬ self had experienced from him in the negociations of the treaty of Utrecht. The agitation which all France felt by Law’s system, and the consequent sending of the pailiament into exile, was a trial to the wise policy of the president Henault. His friendship for the first pre¬ sident, De Mesmes, led him to second all the views of that great magistrate: he took part in all the neeocia- tions, and was animated purely by the public good, without any private advantage/ On the death of the cardinal dti Bois, in 1732, he succeeded in his place at the French academy.

The first edi¬ tion of the work, the result of 40 years reading, ap¬ peared in 1744, under the auspices of the chancellor Daguesseau, with the modest title of an Essay. The success it met with surprised him. He made continual improvements in it, and it has gone through nine edi¬ tions, and been translated into Italian, English, and German, and even into Chinese. As the best writings are not secure from criticism, and are indeed the only ones that deserve it, the author read to the academy of Belles Lettres a defence of his abridgement. All the ages and events of the French monarchy being present to his mind, and his imagination and memory being a vast theatre whereon he beheld the different movements and parts of the actors in the several revolutions, he de¬ termined to give a specimen of what passed in his own mind, and to reduce into the form of a regular drama one of the periods of French history, the reign of Fran¬ cis II. which, though happy only by being short, ap¬ peared to him one of the most important by its conse¬ quences, and most easy to be confined within the stage bounds.

"With regard to bis poetical merit, it must undoubt¬ edly rank very far below that of Homer, whom indeed he scarcely resembles in any other respects than that he went about, as Homer is said to have done, reciting the exploits of the heroes of his country, and that he was blind. In this last circumstance, however, he was still worse than Homer ; for Henry was born blind, but Homer became blind after he had been advanced in years. Hence Henry, even supposing his genius to have been equal to that of Homer, must have lain un¬ der great disadvantages; and these are very evident in his works. The descriptive parts are evidently defi¬ cient, and the allusions taken principally from the way in which nature affects those senses of which he was possessed. Thus, speaking of the month of March, he calls it the month of right digestion, from the supposed fermentation then begun in the earth. Of April he says that the earth is then able, or has obtained a power of producing its different vegetables ; and of this produc¬ tive power lie appears to have been more sensible than of the effects which commonly strike us most sensibly",March,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"of Scotland by his queen Anne sister of the king of Denmark, and one of the most accomplished princes of the age in which he lived, was born on the 19th of February 1594* The birth of the prince was announ¬ ced by embassies to many foreign powers, with invi¬ tations to be present at the ceremony of his baptism, which was thus delayed for a considerable time. Mr Peter Young, who, along with the celebrated George Buchanan, had been preceptor to his majesty, was sent to the courts of Denmark, Brunswic, and Meck¬ lenburg, the duke of Mecklenburg being great-grand¬ father to the prince by the mother’s side ; the laird of East ""Weems to France and England ; and Sir Robert Kieith, and Captain Murray provost of St Andrew’s, 2: to the States General, who at that time were strug¬ gling against the Spanish tyranny, and not yet declared a free state. All these ambassadors were cordially re¬ ceived, and others appointed in return except by the courts of France and England. Henry IV. at that time king of France, though the Scots ambassador had formerly been one of his own servants, neither made any present, nor appointed an ambassador. Queen Elizabeth had designed to act in the same manner till she heard of the behaviour of Henry 5 after which she honoured James by appointing an ambassador of very high rank, Robert earl of Sussex. This ambassador, however, was so long of making his appearance, that the queen imagined the ceremony would be over before his arrival; for which reason she sent a message to the earl, commanding him in that case not to enter Scot¬ land nor deliver her present. But James had been more obsequious $ and not only delayed the ceremony till the English ambassador arrived, but distinguished him from the rest by having a canopy carried over his head at the procession, supported by the lairds of Cess- ford, Buccleugh, Duddope, and Traquair. The ce¬ remony was performed with great magnificence j after which the ambassadors presented their gifts. That from the United States was the most valuable. It consisted of two gold cups worth 12,400 crowns, with a box of the same metal, weighing in all about 400 ounces, containing besides the grant of a pension of 5000 florins annually to the prince for life. The Eng¬ lish ambassador gave a cupboard of plate curiously wrought, and valued at 3000I. sterling j and the Danish ambassador two gold chains, one for the queen and another for the prince.

"The queen, however, who had been desired to follow the king to London in three weeks, but to leave the prince in Scotland, thought proper to make another attempt to get her son into her own power. With this view she took a journey to Stirling, where the prince resided, but was opposed in her designs by the friends of the house of Mar j and this affected her so much, that she miscarried of a child of which she was then pregnant. The king, hearing of this misfortune, ordered the prince to be delivered to his mother; but refused to inflict any punishment on the earl of Mar, which the queen insisted upon, that nobleman having been with the king at London, and entirely innocent of the whole affair. Instead of punishing him, there¬ fore, he caused him to be acquitted by an act of the public council at Stirling; invested him with the order of the Garter ; made him a grant of several abbey and Other church lands; and raised him to the post of lord high treasurer after the disgrace of the earl of Somer¬ set ; in which employment he continued till he could no longer perform the duties of his office through age and infirmity","London, Stirling, London, Stirling",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"In the month of July this year (1603) Prince Henry was invested with the order of the Garter ; after which he was presented to the queen in his robes, and greatly commended by all who saw him on account cf his majestic carriage and religious behaviour at the altar, as well as the quickness of his understanding and ready answers. Being obliged to leave London on account of the plague, he retired to Otelands, a royal palace near Weybridge in Surrey, where a sepa¬ rate household was appointed for him and his sister Elizabeth. The appointment consisted at first of 70 servants, of whom 22 were to be above stairs and 48 below. In some weeks the number was augmented to 104, of whom 51 were above stairs and 53 below; but before the end of the year they were augmented to 141, of whom 56 were above stairs and 85 below","London, Weybridge, Surrey, Elizabeth","GB,CA,US",6,"United Kingdom,Canada,United States","Europe,North America,North America"
"Prince Henry now began to show himself equally a patron of military men and of learning. His martial disposition induced him to take notice of Colonel Ed- mondes, a brave Scots officer in the Dutch service, who had raised himself solely by his merit. To him he applied for a suit of armour to be sent over from Holland : but though the colonel executed his com¬ mission, he reaped no benefit from his highness’s fa¬ vour, dying in a short time after the armour was pur¬ chased, before he had any opportunity of sending it over. In matters of literature the prince appears to have been a very good judge. He patronized divines, and appears to have been naturally of a religious turn of mind. His attachment to the Protestant religion ap¬ pears to have been excessive ; as it never was in the power of the queen, who favoured the Catholic party, to make the least impression upon him. Her machina¬ tions for this purpose were discovered by the Irench ambassador; who, in a letter dated June 7. 1604, informed his master of them, and that the Spaniards were in hopes of being able by her means to alter the religion in England, as well as to prejudice the prince against France, which the queen said she hoped that her son would one day he able to conquer like another Henry V. By another letter, of date 22d October the ■* HEN [ 382 ] HEN ncniy. same year, the ambassador, after taking notice of the -y. i. ,.i queen’s immoderate ambition, adds, that she used all her efforts to corrupt the mind of the prince, by flat¬ tering his passions, diverting him from his studies, and representing to him, out of contempt to his father, that learning was inconsistent with the character of a great general and conqueror j proposing at the same time a marriage with the infanta of Spain. Notwithstanding these remonstrances, however, the prince continued to behave as usual, and to patronise the learned no less than before. He presented John Johnston, one of the king’s professors at St Andrew’s with a diamond, lor having dedicated to him an Historical Description of the kings of Scotland from the foundation of the mo¬ narchy to that time ; after which the professor added a carmen encomiasticum, which was transmitted to his highness in November 1605. Many other authors also sought and obtained his countenance. In j6c6 Mr John Bond ushered his edition of Horace into the world with a polite dedication to the prince, whom he highly compliments on account ol the progress he had made in learning. In 1609 a book was sent over to him from France by Sir George Carew, the Bri¬ tish ambassador there, tending to disprove the doctrine of the Catholics concerning the church of Rome being the first of the Christian churches. The same year the learned Thomas Tydyat published his Emendatio Ecm- gorum, which appeared under the patronage ot the prince; and with this performance his highness was so well pleased, that he took the author into his family to read to him, and made him his chronographer and cosmographer. Paul Buys or Busius also sent him a letter with a dedication of the second part of his Pan¬ dects; in which he bestows upon him the highest com¬ pliments on the great expectations which were formed of him, and of the hopes entertained by the reformed Christian churches that he would prove a powerful sup¬ port to their cause, and antagonist to the errors of Rome. In 1611 Dr Tooker, in his dedication of an Answer to Becanus a Jesuit, who had written agnlnst a piece done by his majesty himself, styles his highness 4* the Maecenas of all the learned.” Another treatise against the same Becanus was also printed this year, and dedicated to the prince","Holland, Rome, Rome","US,FR,ES,NL",6,"United States,France,Spain,Netherlands","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"On the same occasion also Lord Spenser wrote him a letter, accompanying it with the present of a sword and target; “ instruments (says he) fit to be about you in those treacherous times ; from the which, I trust, God will ever protect your most royal father, &c.” Previous to this he had corresponded in Latin with the doge of Venice, the landgrave of Hesse, and the king of Den¬ mark ; in French with the duke of Savoy, and in La¬ tin with the duke of Brunswic and Uladislaus Ling of Poland ; besides a number of other eminent persons too tedious to enumerate",Venice,"PL,US,FR",6,"Poland,United States,France","Europe,North America,Europe"
"_ The great accomplishments of Henry soon caused him to be taken notice of by the most eminent princes in Europe. In 1606 Henry IV. of France ordered jjcni his ambassador to pay him special regard on all occa--y sions. He desired him likewise to salute the prince in the name of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII. and to inform him of the regard the latter had for him. A message was also sent by the same ambassador to M. de St Anthoine, appointed to be riding-master to his high¬ ness, enjoining him to do his duty in that office: and assuring him that his majesty would be as much pleased with it as if the service had been done to himself. To these messages the prince returned very proper answers; and afterwards performed his exercise in the riding- school before the ambassador himself, that the latter might send an account thereof to his master. On this occasion he mounted two horses, and acquitted himself so well that the ambassador in a letter to M. de Ville- roy, the French secretary, gave him the character of “ a prince who promised very much, and whose friend¬ ship could not but be one day of advantage.” Flaving then set forth the propriety of cultivating a good under¬ standing with him, he tells the secretary, that the dau¬ phin might make a return for some dogs which the prince had sent him, by a suit of armour well gilt and enamelled, together with pistols and a sword of the same kind ; also two horses, one of them a barb.— This year also the prince waited on his uncle the king of Denmark, who had come to England on a visit to King James ; and this monarch was so much pleased with his company, that he presented him at parting with his vice-admiral and best fighting ship, valued at no less than 2500I. also with a rapier and hanger, va¬ lued at 2000 marks. The states of Holland were equally ready to show their attachment. On the 25th of Au¬ gust this year they sent a letter to the prince in French, accompanied with the present of a set of table-linen, which they thought, as being the produce of their own country, would be agreeable to him ; and they requested his love and favour towards their state : in return for which they promised to be always ready to show their regard for him, and to do him all possible service ; as the ambassador himself was ordered more particularly to declare. About this time the prince himself wrote a letter to Henry IV. acknowledging the kindness which his majesty had shown him for se¬ veral years, and confirmed of late by the latter offering him under his own royal hand his friendship and that of the dauphin",Holland,"FR,DK,US",6,"France,Denmark,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"While James was this year employed in hunting, the French ambassador, who had been obliged to quit London on account of the plague, took frequent op¬ portunities of waiting upon his highness, as did also the Spanish ambassador, whose ostensible reason was to inform him about some horses which were to be sent him from Spain. The prince’s partiality towards Fiance, however, was so evident, that the French am¬ bassador, in a letter dated 31st October 1606, mentions, that “ as far as he could discover, his highness’s incli¬ nation was entirely towards France, and that it would he wrong to neglect a prince who promised such great things. None of his pleasures (continued he) savour the least of a child. He is a particular lover of horses and whatever belongs to them : but is not fond of hunt¬ ing ; and when he goes to it, it is rather for the plea¬ sure of galloping than that which the dogs give him",London,"FR,ES,GB",6,"France,Spain,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe,Europe"

He shows himself likewise very good-natu¬ red to his dependents, supports their interests against any persons whatever, and pushes whatever he under¬ takes for them or others with such zeal as gives suc¬ cess to it. For besides his exerting his whole strength to compass what he desires, he is already feared by those who have the management of affairs, and espe¬ cially by the earl of Salisbury, who appears to be greatly apprehensive of the prince’s ascendant j as the prince, on the other hand, shows little esteem for his lordship.” In this letter the ambassador further goes on to remark, that some of the prince’s attendants had formerly been made to expect pensions from France ; and he was of opinion that they ought to be gratified on account of the interest they had with the prince",Salisbury,"FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"His majesty, contrary to custom, opened the prince’s letter immediately ; and was so much surprised at the beauty of the character, that he could not be satisfied that it was the prince’s hand until he compared the signature with the rest of the writing. In his letter to the British court on this occasion, the ambassador sets forth in strong terms the affection expressed by the French monarch for the prince 5 “ accounting of him as of his own son, as he hoped that his good brother of Great Britain would do the like of the Dauphin.” The French ambassador also gave a character of his highness similar to that already mentioned; remark¬ ing, “ that the prince had great accomplishments and courage ; would soon make himself talked of, and pos¬ sibly give jealousy to his father, and apprehensions to those who had the greatest ascendant at court.” With regard to the pensions to his attendants, he was at first of opinion that they ought to be granted ; but after¬ wards altered his mind, perceiving that there was little probability of the prince being influenced by any of his attendants, as he was much more inclined to be guided by his own judgment than by the suggestions of others.—In the month of July this year the Dutch ambassadors came recommended to Prince Henry by the States, who wrote to him that they had ordered their ambassadors to kiss his highness’s hands on their part, and desired him to continue his friendship to their republic, and to allow their ambassadors a favourable audience, and the same credit as to themselves",,"GB,FR,NL",6,"United Kingdom,France,Netherlands","Europe,Europe,Europe"

"About the middle of January 1612, Prince Henrv ordered all his majesty’s master-shipwrights and build¬ ers to attend him, to consider of a proposition con¬ cerning the building of ships in Ireland made by a Mr Barrel. Some of his propositions were, that he should build any ship from iod to 600 tons, with two decks and a half, at the rate of five pounds per ton ; that he would build any ship from 6oo to xooo tons, with three whole decks, at the rate of seven pounds per ton ; that he should build a ship of 6oo tons within a certain time, &c. Mr Pett was employed to see that this contract was fulfilled on the part of Mr Bur- rel. Among the prince’s papers, a list of the royal navy was found after his death, with an account of all the expences of fitting out, manning, &c. which must now be accounted a valuable addition to the naval hi¬ story of those times. His passion for naval affairs na¬ turally led him to a desire of making geographical dis¬ coveries ; of which, however, only two instances have reached our times. One was in 1607, when he recei¬ ved from Mr Tindal his gunner, who had been em¬ ployed by the Virginia company, a draught of James’s river in that country, with a letter dated 22d June the same year. In this letter Mr Tindal remarks, that his fellow’-adventurers had discovered that river; and that no Christian had ever been there before; that they were safely arrived and settled ; that they found the coun¬ try very fruitful ; and that they had taken a real and public possession in the name and to the use of the king his highness’s father. The other instance was in the year 1612, the same in which he died, when he employed Mr Thomas Button, an eminent mariner, to go in quest of a north-west passage. Mr Button ac- cordinaly set sail with two ships, named the Resolution and Discovery; the same designations with those in which the late Captain Cook made his last voyage",Virginia,"IE,ZA",6,"Ireland,South Africa","Europe,Africa"
"The martial disposition of the prince, which was conspicuous on all occasions, eminently displayed it¬ self on the occasion of his being invested in the prin¬ cipality of Wales and duchy of Cornwall, which took place in the year 1610.

"In one instance, the extreme desire which Prince Henry had of being instructed in military affairs, car¬ ried him beyond those bounds which European nations have prescribed to one another. In 1607 the prince de Joinville, brother to the duke of Guise, came to England, having been obliged to leave France in con¬ sequence of his having made love to the countess de Moret the king’s mistress. After having been for a few weeks magnificently entertained at court, he departed for France in the beginning of June. The prince took an opportunity of sending to Calais in the train of the prince an engineer in his own service, who took the opportunity of examining all the fortifications of the town, particularly those of the Rix-Banc. This was discovered by the French ambassador, who imme¬ diately gave notice of it to court, but excused the prince, as supposing that what he had done was more out of curiosity than any thing else ; and the court seemed to be of the same opinion, as no notice was ever taken of the affair, nor was the friendship between King Henry and the prince in tlie smallest degree interrupt¬ ed. The martial disposition of his highness was great¬ ly encouraged by some people in the military line, who put into his hands a paper entitled “ Propositions for War and Peace.” Notwithstanding this title, how¬ ever, the aim of the author was evidently to promote war rather than peace ; and for this the. following ar¬ guments were used. t.

He delighted in conversing with people of skill and experience in war concerning every part of their profession ; caused new pieces ot ordnance to be made, with which he learned to shoot at a mark ; and was so careful to furnish himself with a breed of good horses, that no prince in Europe could boast of a superiority in this respect. He was solici¬ ted by Sir Edward Conway to direct his attention to the affairs of the continent, where Sigismund III. of Poland threatened, in conjunction with the king of Denmark, to attack Gustavus Adolphus, the young king of Sweden •, but the death of the prince, which hap¬ pened this year, prevented all interference of this kind",Conway,"PL,DK,SE,US",6,"Poland,Denmark,Sweden,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"
"Under this year, 1611, the elegant Latin historian of Great Britain from 1572 to 1628, Robert Johnston, places a story, which, though unsupported by any au¬ thority but his own, and improbable in itself, must not be omitted here. The prince, according to this writer, requested the king that he might be appointed to preside in the council. This demand was seconded by the king’s favourite, Car Viscount Rochester, who urged his majesty to lay his son’s request before the council. But the earl of Salisbury, jealous of the growing power of Rochester, and a thorough master of artifice and dissimulation, used all his efforts to de¬ feat whatever measures were proposed by his rival and being asked soon after his opinion upon this point, whether it was for the public interest that the prince should preside in the council, answered, that he thought it dangerous to divide the government, and to invest the son with the authority of the father. Many others of the privy council having delivered their opinions on the same question, that ol the earl of Salisbury was adopted by the majority. But his lordship soon took an opportunity, in a secret conference with the prince, to lament his own situation, and to persuade his big! - I ness that Lord Rochester had the only influence in the palace, and privately counteracted all his designs. The prince, on his part, resented the denial of his request, and his exclusion from public business. It was not long before Lord Rochester discovered the earl of Sa¬ lisbury’s practice against him with the prince j to whom he therefore went to clear himself-, but his high¬ ness turned from him with great indignation, and would not hear his justification. The queen likewise, highly displeased with the viscount, refused to see him, and sought all means of lessening his power. This forwardness imputed to the prince by the historian, in endeavouring to intrude himself into the management of public affairs, is not (as Dr Birch remarks) at all suitable to the character of his highness, or to any other accounts which we have of him ; nor ought it to be believed upon the credit of a writer who cites no authority for it, nor indeed for scarce any other assertions in his history, how extraordinary so ever they appear to he, and who frequently ventures to enlarge upon subjects which it was impossible for him to have known. However, it is not much to be doubted, that the prince had no great esteem for Lord Rochester, whose rise to the power of a favourite and a minister he so much disliked, if we may believe a satirical writer of Memoirs *, that he was reported either to have* Fi ; struck his lordship on the back with a racket, or very hardly forborne it. And another historian, not much ^^, 5 less satirical, Arthur Wilson f, mentions the bicker-^ /A ings betwixt the prince and the viscount; and that Sir jaw James Elphinston one day observing his highness to be sect. • discontented with the viscount, offered to kill him ; f°r^ which the prince reproved him, and said that if thereby were cause he would do it himself. But to wave suchjf jifs 1 very suspicious authorities, it will be sufficient, in order to judge of his highness’s opinion of the viscount, and his administration at the very height of it,^ to hear what himself says in a letter to Sir Thomas Ldmondes ot HEN [ 387 ] HEN of the loth of September 1612; “As matters go now here, I will deal in no businesses of importance for some respects.” It is not to Ge supposed but that the marriage of a prince so accomplished and so much admired would en¬ gage the attention of the public. This was indeed the case. The queen, who favoured the interest of Spain, proposed a match with the infanta, and the king of Spain himself seemed to be inclined to the match. In 1611 a proposal was made for a double marriage be¬ twixt the prince of Wales and the eldest daughter of the house of Savoy, and between the prince of Savoy and the lady Elizabeth j but these overtures were very coolly received, being generally disagreeable to the nation. Sir Walter Raleigh, at that time prisoner in the Tower, wrote two excellent treatises against these matches •, in one of which he styles the prince The most excellent and hopeful, as he does also in the introduction to his Observations on the royal navy and sea-service. About the year 1612, his marriage be¬ came an object of general attention. In this aflair the king seems to have inclined to match his son with the princess who promised to bring the largest dowry y the nation at large to have been influenced by motives of religion ; and the prince himself to have remained en¬ tirely passive, and to have been willing to bestow his person with the most perfect indifference on whatso¬ ever princess should be chosen for him. This appears from a letter to the king dated 5th October 1612, in which he considers the match with the second princess of France as in a manner concluded. Proposals had indeed been made of sending her over to England for her education, she being only nine years of age at that time 5 but Villeroy the French minister was of opi¬ nion, that this ought to be delayed for a year longer","Rochester, Salisbury, Rochester, Salisbury, Elizabeth, Raleigh","US,ES,FR",6,"United States,Spain,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Tiie reasons assigned by the prince for wishing her coming to England at that time were merely political: 1. Because the French court, by having the princess in their power, might alter her mind as they pleased : 2. That there would thus be a greater likelihood of converting her to the Protestant religion 5 and 3",,FR,6,France,Europe
"That his majesty’s credit would be better preserved when both daughters (the eldest being promised to the prince of Spain) should be delivered at the same time, though the conclusion of the one marriage might be much later than of the other. _ With regard to the exercise of her leligion, the prince expressed himself rather in severe terms, wishing his majesty only to al¬ low her to use it in “ her most private and secret chamber.” He then argues with the most philosophic indifference of the propriety of a match with the French princess rather than with one of the house of Savoy : concluding at last in the following words ; “ If I have incurred in the same error that I did last by the indifterence of my opinion, I humbly crave par¬ don of your majesty, holding it fitter for your majesty to resolve what course is most convenient to be taken by the rules of the state, than for me who am so little acquainted with subjects ot that nature : pnd besides, your majesty may think, that my part to play, which is to be in love with any ot them, is nut yet at hand.” On the whole, it appeared, that there never was any real design in the king or prince to bring this matter to a conclusion ; and that the proposal had been made only with a view to break oft' the match of the eldest daughter with the prince of Spain, which could not now be done",,"ES,FR",6,"Spain,France","Europe,Europe"

"The immature death of the prince concurring with the public apprehensions of the powrer of the papists, and the ill opinion which the nation then had of the court, gave immediate rise to suspicions of its being hastened by poison. And these suspicions were height¬ ened by the very little concern shown by some persons in great stations. “ To tell you (says Richard earl of Dorset in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes, ot the 23 d HEN [ 39i ] HEN lem-y. of November 1612) that our rising sun is set ere scarcely he had shone, and that with him all our glory lies buried, you know and do lament as well as we, and better than some do, and more truly; or else you are not a man, and sensible of this kingdom’s loss.” And it is certain, that this loss made so little impression up¬ on the king and his favourite, that the lord viscount Kochester on the 9th of November, three days after it, wrote to Sir Thomas Edmondes to begin a nego- eiation for a marriage between Prince Charles and the second daughter of France. But the ambassador, who had more sense of decency, thought it improper to en¬ ter upon such an affair so soon after the late prince’s death. Mr Beaulieu, secretary to Sir Thomas Ed¬ mondes, in a letter of the I2th of November 1612, to Mr Trumbull, then resident at Brussels, after styling the prince “ the flower of his house, the glory of his country, and the admiration of all strangers, which in all places had imprinted a great hope on the minds of the well affected, as it had already stricken terror into the hearts of his enemies,” adds, “ who perhaps (for of this lamentable accident we have yet no particular relation) fearing the growing virtues of that young prince, have used the traiterous venom of their abomi¬ nable practices to cut him off' in his youth. And this I do not apprehend without cause, considering the seve¬ ral advertisements which I saw a month ago coming out of England, Holland, and Calais, of strange rumours which were in these parts, of some great and imminent practice in hand, for the success whereof it was written, that in some places our adversaries had made solemn prayers : and out of Calais it was especially advertised, that in your parts they were in expectation of the death of some great prince. But,, alas ! we did little appre¬ hend, that such ominous prognostications would have lighted upon the person of that vigorous young prince, whose extraordinary great parts and virtues made many men hope and believe, that God had reserved and des¬ tined him, as a chosen instrument, to be the standard- bearer of his quarrel in these miserable times, to work the restoration of his church, and the destruction of the Romish idolatry","Brussels, Holland, Calais, Calais","FR,BE,US",6,"France,Belgium,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"With the above notion his royal highness’s mother the queen was peculiarly impressed, according to Dr Welwood ; who, in his Notes on Arthur Wilson’s Life of King James I. in the Complete History of England, p. 714. informs us, though without giving any authority, that when the prince fell into his last illness, the queen sent to Sir Walter Raleigh for some iff' his cordials, which she herself had taken some time before in a fever with remarkable success. Raleigh sent it, together with a letter to the queen, wherein he expressed a tender concern for the prince j and, boasting of his medicine, stumbled unluckily upon an expression to this purpose, “ that it would certainly cure him or any other of a lever, except in case ot poison."""" As the prince took this medicine, and e.ied notwithstanding its virtues, the queen, in the agony of her grief, showed Raleigh’s letter j and laid so much c weight on the expression about poison, that as long as she lived she could never he persuaded hut that the cte, prince had died by that means. Sir Anthony Weldon * «W<*, suggests that the prince was poisoned. The same no- 77- 78. lion is countenanced by Wilson in his History f- j and '^•'’J-was adopted by Dr Welwood, as already mentioned: Who likewise, in another work, his Memoirs, after Henry, styling the prince “ the darling of mankind, and a *»—-y—— youth of vast hopes and wonderful virtues,” remarks, that it was the general rumour at the time of his death, that his highness was poisoned ; and that there is in print a sermon preached at St James’s upon the disso¬ lution of his family, that boldly insinuated some such thing. By this sermon Dr Welwood must mean that of Mr Hall cited above * in which, however, at least as it is reprinted in the .London edition of his works in 1617, in folio, there is not to be found any expres¬ sion that carries the least insinuation of that kind. The writer of the memoirs adds, that Sir Francis Bacon, in his speech at the trial of the earl of Somerset, had some reflections upon the intimacy of that lord with Sir Thomas Overbury, which seemed to point that way \ there being several expressions left out of the printed copy that were in the speech. Bishop Burnet likewise tells us, that he was assured by Colonel Titus, that he had heard King Charles I. declare, that the prince his brother was poisoned by the means of the viscount Rochester, afterwards earl of Somerset. But it will be perhaps sufficient to oppose to all such sug¬ gestions the unanimous opinion of physicians who at¬ tended the prince during his sickness, and opened his body after his death ; from which, as Dr Welwood him¬ self observes, there can be no inference drawn that he was poisoned. To which may be added the authority of Sir Charles Cornwallis J, who was well informed, t Life an^ and above all suspicion in this point, and who pronoun- l?Tcatfi, ces the rumours spread of his highness’s having been ^ poisoned vain 5 and was fully convinced that his death was natural, and occasioned by a violent fever","Raleigh, Raleigh, Raleigh, Wilson, London, Somerset, Rochester, Somerset","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

"Henry, Dr Robert, author of the “ History of Great Britain, written on a new plan,” was the son of Ja mes Henry farmer at Muirtown in the parish of St Ninian’s, North Britain, and of Jean Galloway daughter of Galloway of Burrovvmeadow in Stirlingshire.

"By the friendship of Gilbert Laurie, Esq. lord provost of Edinburgh, and one of his majesty’s com¬ missioners of excise in Scotland, who had married the sister of Mrs Henry, he was removed to Edinburgh in 1768 j and it is to this event that the public are in¬ debted for his prosecution of the History of Great Britain. His access to the public libraries, and the means of supplying the materials which these did not afford him, were from that time used with so much diligence and perseverance, that the first volume of his History in quarto was published in ly?1* ^ie second in 1774, the third in 1777, the fourth in 1781, and the fifth (which brings down the History to the acces¬ sion of Henry VII.) in 1785. The subject of these volumes comprehends the most intricate and obscure periods of our history j and when we consider the scanty and scattered materials which Dr Henry has digested, and the accurate and minute information which he has given us under every chapter of the work, we must have a high opinion both of the learning and industry of the author, and of the vigour and activity of his mind : especially when it is added, that he em¬ ployed no amanuensis, but completed the manuscript ■ with his own hand; and that, excepting the first vo¬ lume, the whole book, such as it is, was printed from the original copy. Whatever corrections were made on it, were inserted by interlineations, or in revising the proof sheets. He found it necessary, indeed, to con¬ fine himself to a first copy, from an unfortunate tre¬ mor in his hand, which made writing extremely in¬ convenient, which obliged him to write with his paper on a book placed on his knee instead fof a table, and which unhappily increased to such a degree that in the last years of his life he was often unable to take his victuals without assistance. An attempt which he made after the publication of the fifth volume to em¬ ploy an amanuensis did not succeed. Never having been accustomed to dictate his compositions, he found it impossible to acquire a new habit ; and though he persevered but a few days in the attempt, it had a sen* sible effect on his health, which he never afterwards recovered.—An author has no right to claim indul- Vol. X.

"This was eagerly seized on by the adversaries of his History, and torn to pieces with a virulence and aspe¬ rity which no want of merit in the sermon could justify or explain. An anonymous letter had appeared in a newspaper to vindicate the History from some of the unjust censures which had been published, and asserting from the real merit and accuracy of the book the au¬ thor’s title to the approbation of the public. An an¬ swer appeared in the course of the following week, charging him, in terms equally confident and indecent, with having written this letter in his own praise. The efforts of malignity seldom fail to defeat their purpose, and to recoil on those who direct them. Dr Henry had many friends, and till lately had not discovered that he had any enemies. But the author of the ano¬ nymous vindication was unknown to him, till the learned and respectable Dr Macqueen, from the indig¬ nation excited by the confident petulance oi the an¬ swer, informed him that the letter had been written by him. These anecdotes are still remembered. I he abuse of the History, which began in Scotland, was renewed in some ol the periodical publications in South Britain; though it is justice to add (without meaning to refer to the candid observations of English critics), that in both kingdoms the asperity originated in the same quarter, and that paragraphs and criticisms writ¬ ten at Edinburgh were printed in London.

As to hereditary arms of families, Wil¬ liam Camden, Sir Henry Spelman, and other judici¬ ous heralds, agree, that they began no sooner than to¬ wards the latter end of the nth century. According to Father Menestrier’s opinion, a French writer, whose authority is of great weight in this matter, Henry I’Oi- seleur (the Falconer) who was raised to the imperial throne of the West in 920, hy regulating tournaments in Germany gave occasion to the establishment of fami¬ ly-arms, or hereditary marks of honour, which unde¬ niably are more ancient and better observed among the Germans than in any other nation. Moreover, this last author asserts, that with tournaments first came up coats-of-arms ; which were a sort of livery, made up of sevei-al lists, fillets, or narrow pieces of stuff of divers colours, from whence came the fess, the bend, the pale, &c. which were the original charges of family- arms j for they who never had been at tournaments, had not such marks of distinction. They who insisted themselves in the Croisades, took up also several new figures hitherto unknown in armorial ensigns $ such as alerians, bezants, escalop-shells, martlets, &c. but more particularly crosses, of difl’erent colours for distinction’s sake. From this it may be concluded, that heraldry, like most human inventions, was insensibly introduced and established ; and that, after having been rude and unsettled for many ages, it was at last methodised, perfected, and fixed, by the Croisades and tourna¬ ments","Wil, Camden","DE,CH,US,FR",6,"Germany,Switzerland,United States,France","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"

But the same man was wise and capricious ; redressed wrongs, and quarrelled for punctilios ; hated bigotry in religion, and was him¬ self a bigot to philosophy. He exposed himself to such dangers as other men of courage would have care¬ fully declined : and called in question the fundamen¬ tals of a religion which none had the hardiness to dis¬ pute besides himself.” Herbert, JFilham, earl of Pembroke, was born at Wilton in Wiltshire, 1580; and admitted to New- college in Oxford in 1592, where he continued about two years. In 1601 he succeeded to his father’s ho¬ nours and estate ; was made K. G. in 1604 ; and go¬ vernor of Portsmouth six years after.

He died suddenly at his house called Bay- aard's castle, in London, April 10. 1630 ; according to the calculation of his nativity, says Wood, made several years before by Mr Thomas Allen of Gloucester- hall. Clarendon relates concerning this calculation that some considerable persons connected with Lord Pembroke being met at Maidenhead, one of them at supper drank a health to the lord steward; upon which another said, that he believed his lordship w-as at that time very merry ; for he had now outlived the day, which it had been prognosticated upon his nativity he would not outlive ; but he had outlived it now, for that was his birth day, which had completed his"" age to 50 years.

Dionysius Hali- carnassensis conjectures that it may be referred to 6q years before the war of Troy, or about 1342 years be¬ fore Christ ; and therefore that it lasted about 1400 years","Naples, Troy","US,IT",6,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"The thickness of the heap of lava and ashes by which the city was overwhelmed, has been much in¬ creased by fiery streams vomited since that catastrophe ; and now forms a mass 24 feet deep, of dark gray stone, which is easily broken to pieces. By its non¬ adhesion to foreign bodies, marbles and bronzes are preserved in it as in a case made to fit them ; and exact moulds of the faces and limbs of statues ate frequently found in this substance. The precise situation of this subterraneous city was not known till the year 1713) when it was accidentally discovered by some labourers, who, in digging a well, struck upon a statue on the benches of the theatre. Many others were afterwards dug out and sent to France by the prince of Elboeuf",,FR,6,France,Europe
"HER [ 429 ] HER cula. But little progress was made in tlie excavations till am. Charles infant of Spain ascended the Neapolitan throne j v—by whose unwearied efforts and liberality a very con¬ siderable part of Herculaneum has been explored, and such treasures of antiquity drawn out as form the most curious museum in the world. It being too arduous a task to attempt removing the covering, the king contented himself with cutting galleries to the princi¬ pal buildings, and causing the extent of one or two of them to be cleared. Of these the theatre is the most considerable. On a ballustrade which divided the or¬ chestra from the stage was found a row of statues ; and, on each side of the pulpitum, the equestrian figure of a person of the Nonia family. They are now placed under porticoes of the palace ; and from the great rarity of equestrian statues in marble would be very valuable objects, were their workmanship e.ven less ex¬ cellent than it is : one of them in particular is a very fine piece of sculpture. Since the king of Spain left Naples, the digging has been continued, but with less spirit and expenditure : indeed the collection of curio¬ sities brought out of Herculaneum and Pompeii is al¬ ready so considerable, that a relaxation of zeal and activity becomes excusable. They are now arranged in a wing of the palace ; and consist not only of statues, busts, altars, inscriptions, and other ornamental ap¬ pendages of opulence and luxury ; but also comprehend an entire assortment of the domestic, musical, and chi- rurgical instruments used by the ancients $ tripods of elegant form and exquisite execution, lamps in endless variety, vases and basons of noble dimensions, chande¬ liers of the most beautiful shapes, pateras and other appurtenances of sacrifice, looking-glasses of polish¬ ed metal, coloured glass, so hard, clear, and well stained, as to appear emeralds, sapphires, and other precious stones j a kitchen completely fitted up with copper-pans lined with silver, kettles, cisterns for heat¬ ing water, and every utensil necessary for culinary purposes $ specimens of various sorts of combustibles, retaining their form though burnt to a cinder j corn, bread, fish, oil, wine, and flour j a lady’s toilet, fully furnished with combs, thimbles, rings, paint, ear¬ rings, &c. Among the statues, which are numerous, connoisseurs allow the greatest share of merit to a Mer¬ cury and a sleeping faun : the busts fill several rooms j but very few of the originals whom they were meant to imitate are known.

"“ The elegance of the attitudes, and the infinite va¬ riety of the subjects (Mr Swinburne observes), stamp them as performances worthy of the attention of artists and antiquarians ; but no pictures yet found are ma¬ sterly enough to prove that the Greeks carried the art of painting to as great a height of perfection as they did that of statuary. Yet can we suppose those au¬ thors incapable of appreciating the merits of an Apelles or a Zeuxis, who with so much critical discernment have pointed out the beauties of the works of a Phidias or a Praxiteles, beauties that we have still an oppor¬ tunity of contemplating ? would they have bestowed equal praises upon both kinds of performances if either Hercula- ot them had been much inferior to the other ? I think neunr, it is not probable ; and we must presume, that the Hercules, capital productions of the ancient painters, being of more perishable materials than busts and statues, have been destroyed in the fatal disasters that have so often afflicted both Greece and Italy. Herculaneum and Pompeii were but towns of the second order, and not likely to possess the masterpieces of the great artists, which were usually destined to adorn the more celebra¬ ted temples, or the palaces of kings and emperors.” A more valuable acquisition than bronzes and pictures was thought to be made, when a large parcel of manu¬ scripts was found among the ruins. Hopes were en¬ tertained that many, works of the classics, which time has deprived us of, were now going to be restored to light, and that a new mine of science was on the point of being opened. But the difficulty of unrolling the burnt parchment, of pasting the fragments on a flat surface, and of deciphering the obscure letters, have proved such obstacles, that very little progress has been made in the work. A priest invented the method of proceeding; but it was found not to answer. A great many other processes have since been tried, but none has been entirely successful. And the value of the writings which has been unrolled has by no means cor¬ responded to the public expectation.

It may therefore be considered as covering the whole of Germany j and most of the other forests may be con¬ sidered as parts of it, though distinguished by particular names : consequently the Hartz, in the duchy of Bruns- wic, which gave name to the whol£, may be considered as one of its parts. The name Hartz denotes “ resi¬ nous,” or, “ pine-trees.” By the Greeks it is called Or- cyntus, as a name common to all the forests in Germa¬ ny } in the same manner as Hercynius was the name gi¬ ven by the Romans ; and both from the German Hartz",,DE,6,Germany,Europe
"Hereditary is also figuratively applied to good or ill qualities supposed to be transmitted from father to son : thus we say virtue and piety are hereditary qua¬ lities in such a family ; and that in Italy the hatred of families is hereditary.

"Hereditary Right, in the British constitution. The grand fundamental maxim upon which the jus corona, or right of succession to the throne of Britain depends, Sir William Blackstone takes to be this : That the crown is, by common law and constitutional custom, hereditary, and this in a manner peculiar to itself: but Heredi| that the right of inheiitance may from time to time be Risk changed or limited by act of parliament; under which v ' limitations the crown still continues hereditary",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"^ 2. But, secondly, as to the particular mode of inhe¬ ritance. It in general corresponds with the feodal path of descents, chalked out by the common law in the suc¬ cession to landed estates ; yet with one or two material exceptions. Like them the crown will descend line- ally to the issue of the reigning monarch ; as it did from Ring John to Richard II. through a regular pe¬ digree of six lineal generations : As in them the pre¬ ference of males to females, and the right of primoge¬ niture among the males, are strictly adhered to. Thus Edward V. succeeded to the crown, in preference to Richard his younger brother, and Elizabeth his eldest sister. Like them, on failure of the male line it de¬ scends to the issue female ; according to the ancient British custom remarked by Tacitus, Solent fcemina- rum ductu bellare, et sexum in imperils non discerncre, Jhus Mary I. succeeded to Edward VI.; and the line of Margaret queen of Scots, the daughter of Henry VII",Elizabeth,"US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

"For the right of the crown vests eo instanti, upon his heir $ either the hceres natus, if the course of descent remains unimpeached, or the hceres factus, if the in¬ heritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum j but, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, the right of sovereignty is lully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown. And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolute¬ ly hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined : In the same manner as landed estates, to continue our former comparison, are by the law hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; hut still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to ano¬ ther person. If this transfer be made simply and ab¬ solutely, the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir at law : but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed, and no other.

It is supposed to have risen out of the ruins of Kenchester, in its neighbourhood, which Camden believes to have been the Ariconium of Antoninus. It is very plea¬ santly situated among meadows and corn fields, and is almost encompassed with rivers. It seems to have owed its rise, or at least its increase, to the building and dedicating a church there to Ethelhert king of the East Angles, who was murdered in the neigh¬ bourhood, and afterwards taken into the catalogue of martyrs j soon alter it became a bishop’s see, and in consequence of that a considerable place. In 1055 it was sacked, the cathedral destroyed, and its bishop Leofgar carried away captive by Gryffin prince of South-Wales, and Algar, an Englishman, who had rebelled against Edward the Confessor. Harold forti¬ fied it with a broad and high rampart ; and it appears by Doomsday book, that there were no more than 300 men within and without the wall. A very large and strong castle was built by the Normans along the Wye, and the city walled round. The present stately cathedral was founded in the reign of Henry I. by Bishop Reinelm, but enlarged and beautified by his successors. It suffered much in the barons wars ; and was often taken and retaken in the war between King Charles I. and the parliament. This city is pretty large, and had once six churches j but two were de¬ stroyed in the civil wars. It is not very populous nor well built, many of the houses being old. Its manu¬ factures are gloves and other leathern goods ; and its corporation consists of a mayor, six aldermen, a high steward, deputy-steward, and town-cleik j who have a Hercf0l sword-bearer and four serjeants at mace.

"HERMANN, Paul, a celebrated botanist, was born at Halle in Saxony, and practised physic in the island of Ceylon, and the Cape of Good Hope, after which (in 1679) he was chosen professor of botany at Leyden, and superintendant of the botanical garden, in which science he obtained the highest reputation, and died in the year 1695. His first publication, in 1687, was a catalogue of plants in the garden of the univer¬ sity,—a garden which, in seven years he had so much enriched with plants from the East and West Indies, that it nearly rivalled the very first in Europe. His method of botanical classification is contained in his Florce Lugcluno-Batavce Flores, published in 1690.

"HERODOTUS, an ancient Greek historian of Halicarnassus in Caria, son of Lyxus and Dryo, was born in the first year of the 74th Olympiad, that is, about 484 B. C. The city of Halicarnassus being at that time under the tyranny of Lygdamis grandson of Artemisia queen of Caria, Herodotus quitted his country and retired to Samos ; from whence he tra¬ velled over Egypt, Greece, Italy, &c. and in his tra¬ vels acquired the knowledge of the history and origin of many nations. He then began to digest the ma¬ terials he had collected into order, and composed that history which has preserved his name among men ever since. He wrote it in the isle of Samos, according to the general opinion.—Lucian informs us, that when Herodotus left Caria to go into Greece, he began to consider with himself What he should do to be for ever known, And make the age to come his own, in the most expeditious way, and with as little trouble as possible. His history, he presumed, would easily procure him fame, and raise his name among the Gre¬ cians in whose favour it was written *, but then he fore¬ saw that it would be very tedious to go through the several cities of Greece, and recite it to each respective city ; to the Athenians, Corinthians, Argives, Lace- darmonians, &c. He thought it most proper there¬ fore to take the opportunity of their assembling all together j and accordingly recited his work at the Olympic games, which rendered him more famous than even those who had obtained the prizes.

Of what quality his father was, is nowhere said; but that he was driven by his misfortunes from Cumae to Ascra, Hesiod himself informs us.

In the above limits, the county of Katzenellnbogen and some other territories are not included. The whole coun¬ try, in its utmost length, is near 100 miles, and in some places about 60 in breadth. The air is cold, but wholesome ; and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture. The country abounds also in cat¬ tle, fish, and game ; salt springs, baths, and mineral waters. The hills, which are many, yield silver, cop¬ per, lead, iron, alum, vitriol, pit-coal, sulphur, boles, a porcelain earth, marble, and alabaster. In the Eder, gold is sometimes found; and at Frankenberg a gold mine was formerly wrought. Besides many lesser streams, Hesse is watered by the following rivers, viz. the Lhan, the Fulda, the Eder or Schwalm, the Werra or Weser, and Diemel. The Mayne passes through the county of Katzenellnbogen. This coun¬ try, like most others in Germany, has its states, consist¬ ing of the prelates, as they are called, the nobility, and the towns. The diets are divided into general and particular, and the latter into the greater and smaller committees. The house of Hesse is divided into two principal branches, viz.

"Fly. The destruction occasioned by them is described in the “-■~v  American Museum (a magazine published at Phila¬ delphia) for February 1787, in the following words: “ It is well known that all the crops of wheat in all the land over which it has extended, have fallen before it, and that the farmers beyond it dread its approach ; the prospect is, that unless means are discovered to prevent its progress, the whole continent will be overrun •,—a calamity more to be dreaded than the ravages of war.” This terrible insect appeared first in Long Island during the American war, and was supposed to have been brought from Germany by the Hessians ; whence it had the name of the Hessian fly. From thence it has proceeded inland at the rate of about 15 or 20 miles annually; and by the year 1789 had reached 200 miles from the place where it was first observed. At that time it continued to proceed with unabating in¬ crease ; being apparently stopped neither by rivers nor mountains. In the fly state it is likewise exceedingly troublesome ; by getting into houses in swarms, falling into victuals and drink ; filling the windows, and flying perpetually into the candles. It still continued to infest Long Island as much as ever; and in many places the culture of wheat was entirely abandoned","Long Island, Long Island","US,DE",6,"United States,Germany","North America,Europe"
"This, however, has not yet passed the river Delaware ; though there is danger of its being gradually inured to colder climates so as to extend its depredations to the northern colonies also. Put it is by no means the same with the Hessian fly. The wheat fly is the same with that whose ravages in the Angumois in France are recorded by M. Du Hamel ; it eats the grain, and is a moth in its perfect state. On the other hand, the Hessian fly has hitherto been unknown to naturalists ; it eats only the leaf and stalk ; and, in its perfect state, is probably a tenthredo, like the black negro-fly of the turnip",Delaware,"FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"5. In order to procure all the intelligence that could be had concerning these insects, the duke of Dorset addressed a letter to the Royal Society of Agriculture in France, to know whether any of them exists in that country. The report of the society was accompanied with a drawing of two insects-, one of which was sup¬ posed to be the caterpillar of the Hessian fly, from its attacking the wheat only when in the herb ; begin¬ ning its ravages in autumn, reappearing in the spring, and undergoing the metamorphoses already mentioned",,FR,6,France,Europe
"“ That insect (say the society), whose havock has been well known in America only since 1776, does not ap¬ pear to difter from it, as well as we can judge from a very short description of those which have been observed in the north, and of which the history is contained in the different volumes of the academy of sciences of Stockholm. We know that there exist in France ca¬ terpillars whose manner of living resembles that of those insects 5 but the mischief which they do to corn having never been considerable enough to attract the attention of government, and not having been ourselves engaged in following in detail the history of that spe¬ cies of caterpillar, we regret not being able to say any thing particular upon that subject.” The rest of the report contains an account of the flying weevil",Stockholm,"FR,SE",6,"France,Sweden","Europe,Europe"

"II. A farmer in Jersey, who dates his letter from Hunterdon, Jan. 30. 1787, observes, that though the fly is supposed to advance about 15 miles annually, and neither waters nor mountains obstruct its passage, yet when disturbed, he never saw them take a flight of above five or six feet j nevertheless they are so active, that it is very difficult to catch them. They first appear towards the end of September j and soon after their eggs appear hatched, in colour and size like a flax seed j they are very low at the joints 5 some even in the ground 5 and here they harbour all winter. On their first appearance in any district, their numbers be¬ ing small they seldom cut oft' the crop in this state, which is often the case the second or third year. In the spring, after warm weather, they again appear as a small worm, and destroy the crop. The remedies proposed by this farmer are, sowing upon rich ground, elder, and rolling. A gentleman whose account was dated on the first of November 1786, says, that their eggs resemble what is commonly called t\\e fly-blow on meat, being very small, and only one in a place. Soon after, the other blades of wheat proceeding from the same kernel inclose the first, the egg is covered, and agreeable to the usual progress of insects arrives at the state of a worm, and descends towards the root, where it consumes the tender blade, sometimes destroying the whole crop in the fall •, but if, by reason of the fer¬ tility of the soil, and other concurrent circumstances, the vegetation is so rapid as to baffle their efforts, some of the latter-laid eggs, when at the worm state, en¬ trench themselves in the ground to the depth of an inch or more, where he had found them after severe frosts changed from a white to a greenish colour, and almost transparent *, from this they proceed to the au- relia state, and thus continue probably in the ground till the spring, when the fly is again produced, which again lays its eggs, and finishes the work begun in the fall, to the total destruction of the crop. Another piece of intelligence he gives, hut not from his own observa¬ tion, that by feeding the wheat veiy close in the win¬ ter and spring, if the land is rich, it will again spring up, and the worms do not much injure the second growth. By another correspondent we are informed, that maritime places are less liable to be infested with the fly than the interior parts of the country j and therefore recommends as an experiment, that fine salt ijlSsiaa should be sprinkled on the wheat just before, or very Fly",,JE,6,Jersey,Europe
"13. The utmost pains were taken by the British government to find out whether this destructive insect exists in Germany or any of the northern countries ot Europe ; but from the accounts received, it appears that it has not hitherto been observed, or at least it it exists, the damage done by it is too inconsiderable to attract notice",,"DE,GB",6,"Germany,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"14. From the whole correspondence on this subject, which from the abridgement just now given ot it is evidently somewhat discordant, Sir Joseph Banks drew up a report for the privy council, dated March 2.1789* in which he states the following particulars: 1. The appearance of the fly in Long Island was first obser¬ ved in 1770. We must suppose this to be meant H E S [ 454 1 H E S Hessian that its destructive effects became then first percep- Fly. tiblej for it seems undoubtedly to have been known   ' in the year 1776. 2. The opinion of Colonel Mor¬ gan, that it was imported by the Hessians, seems to be -erroneous, as no such insect can be found to exist in Germany or any other part of Kurope. 3. Since its first appearance in Long Island it has advanced at the rate of 15 or 20 miles a year, and neither waters nor mountains have impeded its progress. It was seen crossing the Delaware like a cloud, from the Fall’s Township to Makefield $ had reached Saratoga 200 miles from its first appearance, infesting the counties of Middlesex, Somerset, Huntington, Morris, Sussex, the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, all the wheat coun¬ ties of Connecticut, &c. committing the most dreadful ravages •, attacking wheat, rye, barley, and timothy- grass. 4. The Americans who have suffered by this insect, speak of it in terms of the greatest horror. In Colonel Morgan’s letter to Sir John Temple, he uses the following expressions. “ Were it to reach Great Britain, it would be the greatest scourge that island ever experienced ; as it multiplies from heat and moi¬ sture, and the most intense frosts have no effect on the egg or aurelia. Were a single straw, containing the insect, egg, or aurelia, to be carried and safely depo¬ sited in the centre of Norfolk in England, it would multiply in a few years, so as to destroy all the wheat and bailey crops of the whole kingdom. There can¬ not exist such an atrocious villain as to commit such an act intentionally. 5. No satisfactory account of the mode in which this insect is propagated has hither¬ to been obtained. Those which say that the eggs are deposited on the stalk from six or eight to 50, and by their growth compress and hinder the stalk from grow¬ ing, are evidently erroneous, and the authors of them have plainly mistaken the animal itself for its eggs","March, Long Island, Long Island, Delaware, Saratoga, Somerset, Huntington, Philadelphia, Temple, Norfolk","US,DE,GB",6,"United States,Germany,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"
"In a letter from Mr Bond to the marquis of Caermar- therr, be mentions another kind of insect in the state of Maryland, called by way of eminence t/ie fly; and •which in some things resembles the Hessian fly, though it cannot be accounted the same. It makes its way in- >to the mow, and bites the end of the grain percepti¬ bly, and no doubt deposits its eggs in the grain itself} since it has been observed, that wheat recently thresh¬ ed, and laid in a warm dry place, will soon be covered with an extreme clammy crust, which binds the wheat on the surface together in such a way as to ad¬ mit its being lifted in lumps } but the wheat beneath will not he hurt to any considerable depth. Such is the quality of this fly, that if the hand be inserted into the heap affected by it, watery blisters are immedi¬ ately raised } and the farmers and slaves, riding upon bags of this infected wheat, never fail to be severely blistered thereby. “ This insect (says he) is called in Maryland the Revolution fly, by the friends of the British government } but from all I can learn it is not the same insect which originated on Long Island, and is called the Hessian fly (by way of opprobrium) by those who favoured the revolution. All the papers I have read on the Hessian fly are very inaccurate, not to say contradictory } and I am convinced it is by no means a settled point at this moment, in what manner and place the eggs of these insects are deposited. The policy which induced government to open the ports being founded on an appearance of a scarcity of corn, that evil may be remedied by the admission of flour instead of grain } and though the countries from whence the flour is carried will have the advantage of the manufacture, still that cannot be reckoned as an ob¬ ject, when opposed in the scale to an evil of such im¬ mense magnitude as the introduction of so destructive an insect may occasion.

It is a matter at this time quite undecided here 5 nor have I heard or observed any very conclusive reason to suppose that the fly makes its way generally into barns and ricks. A very intel¬ ligent farmer in the county of Bucks, informed me that it was the prevailing opinion there, and so I found it, that the flv did not, either in the field or in the mow, affect the grain of the wheat: a neighbour of his, in threshing the little wheat he had saved last har¬ vest, observed the fly rise from the straw in great num¬ bers wherever it was struck by the flail ; but though it was at first presumed that the fly had insinuated it¬ self into the mow for the purpose of depositing its eggs in the grain or in the straw, no trace of the egg could be discovered from the appearance of any mucus or dust, either in the grain or in the straw; hence it was inferred that all the mischief was done in the field.” HESA CHIUS, the most celebrated of all the an¬ cient Greek grammarians whose works are now extant, ■was a Christian j and, according to some, the same with Hesychius patriarch of Jerusalem, who died in 639.

"The Hidalgos claim a descent from those valiant sol¬ diers who retired into Castile, and the mountains of Asturias, and other remote parts of Spain, on the in¬ vasion of the Moors, where having fortified themselves, they successively descended into the plains, in propor¬ tion to the success of their arms $ from the notoriety of their persons, or the lands they became possessed of, they acquired the appellation of Hidalgos notorios, Hi¬ dalgos de solar conocido, or de casa solariega. Of these, according to Hernando Mexia, there are three sorts ; the first being lords of places, villages, towns, or castles, from whence they took their surnames, as the Guzmans, Mendozas, Laras, Guivras, and others ; the second, who recovered any fortress from the Moors, as the Ponces ol Leon, and others; and the third sort from the places where they resided, or held jurisdiction, as Rodrigo de Navarez was called of Antequara, from being alcayde there. But this definition is not considered as exact or conclusive by Otalora, another civilian, who says that the true meaning of Hidalgos de solar conocido is explained by the laws of Castile to be a well known mansion or possession, the nature of which is particularly explained in the laws oi Parditas, lib. v. tit. 35. which describe three sorts of tenures, called Devisa, Solariega, and Behetria. By the first, lands are devised by the ancestor ; solar is a tenure upon another person’s manor, and obliges the owner to receive the lord of the fee when necessity obliges him to travel ; and Behetria is in the nature of an allo¬ dium. In proportion as these Aborigines gained ground on the Moors, and increased in their numbers, many private persons distinguished themselves by their valour, and obtained testimonies of their services called cartas de mcrced, which served them as a foundation of their birth and good descent, without which documents their posterity could not make it appear; and if from a lapse of time, or other unavoidable accidents, such proof should happen to be lost or destroyed, the law affords them a remedy under these circumstances, by a declaration importing, that such persons as are sup¬ posed to have had such certificates, may be relieved by making it appear that their ancestors, time imme- H I D morial, have always been held and reputed as Hidal- Hidalgo, gos, and enjoyed the privileges of such, form a strong —y— presumption in their favour; the possession of land having equal force to any other document; which is fully set forth in the Pragmatica of Cordova.

"The publication of “ Pamela;” in 1744, gave rise to a set of paintings by Mr Highmore, which were en¬ graved by two French engravers, and published by subscription in 1745. In the same year he painted the only original of the late General Wolfe, then about 18. His Pamela introduced him to the acquaintance and friendship of the excellent author whose picture he drew, and for whom he painted the only original of Dr Young. In 1750 he had the misfortune to lose his wife. On the first institution of the academy of painting, sculpture, &c. in 1753, he was elected one of the professors; an honour which, on account of his many avocations, he desired to decline. In 1754 he published “ A critical examination of those two Paintings (by Rubens) on the Ceiling of the Ban- queting-house at Whitehall, in which Architecture is introduced, so far as relates to Perspective; to¬ gether with the Discussion of a Question which has been the Subject of Debate among Painters:” print¬ ed in 410. In the solution of this question, he pro¬ ved that Rubens and several other great painters were mistaken in the practice, and Mr Kirby and se- H veral other authors in the theory. And in the 17th volume oi the “ Monthly Review,” he animadverted (anonymously) on Mr Kirby’s unwarrantable treat¬ ment of Mr Ware, and detected and exposed his er¬ rors, even when he exults in his own superior science",Whitehall,"US,FR",6,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"In 1761, on the marriage of his daughter to the reverend Mr Duncombe, son to one of his oldest friends, he took a resolution of retiring from business, and disposing of his collection of pictures, which he did hy auction, in March 1762, and soon after removed to his son-in-law’s at Canterbury, where he passed the re¬ mainder of his life without ever revisiting the metro¬ polis. But though he had laid down the pencil, he never wanted employment: so active and vigorous was his mind, that, with a constitutional flow of spirits, and a relish for instructive society, he was never less “ alone than when alone ;” and besides, his profession¬ al pursuits above mentioned, to philosophy, both na¬ tural and moral, and also to divinity, he laudably dedica¬ ted his time and attention. No man had more clear¬ ness and precision of ideas, or a more ardent desire to know the truth ; and, when known, conscientiously to pursue it. With strong passions, ever guided by the strictest virtue, he had a tender, susceptible heart, always open to the distress of his fellow-creatures, and always ready to relieve them. His capital work of the literary kind was his “ Practice of Perspective, on the principles of Dr Brook Taylor,” &c. written many years before, but not published till 1763, when it was printed for Nonrse, in one vol. 4to. This not only evinced his scientific knowledge of the subject, but removed, by its perspicuity, the only objection, that can be made to the system of Dr Taylor. It ac¬ cordingly received, from his friends and the intelligent public, the applauses it deserved. In 1765 he pub¬ lished (without his name) Observations on a Pamph¬ let entitled, “ Christianity not founded on Argument;” in which, after showing that it is a continued irony, and lamenting that so ample a fitdd should be offered the author of it for the display of his sophistry; he gives up creeds, articles, and catechisms, as out-works raised by fallible men, and, confining himself to the de¬ fence of the gospel, or citadel, shows, that pure primi¬ tive Christianity, though assaulted by infidels, will ever remain impregnable.

"In the same year he published, with only his initials, “ J. H.” two small volumes of “ Essays, moral, religi¬ ous, and miscellaneous j with a Translation in prose of Mr Browne’s Latin Poem on the Immortality of the Soul selected from a large number Written at his lei¬ sure, at difierent periods of life. “ As such (says Dr Hawkesworth) they do the author great credit. They are not excursions of fancy, but efforts of thought, and indubitable indications of a vigorous and active mind.” In the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1769, p. 287. he communicated “ A natural and obvious Manner of constructing Sun-dials, deduced from the Situation and Motion of the Earth with respect to the Sun,” explain¬ ed by a scheme. And in that for 1778, p. 526. his remarks on colouring, suggested by way of a note on the “ Epistle to an eminent Painter,” will show that his talents were by no means impaired at the age of 86. Indeed he retained them to the last, and had even strength and spirits sufficient to enable him to ride out daily on horseback the summer before he died. A strong constitution, habitual temperance, and constant attention to his health in youth as well as in age, pro¬ longed his life, and preserved his faculties to his 88th year, when he gradually ceased to breathe, and, as it were, fell asleep on March 3. 1780. He was interred in the south aisle of Canterbury cathedral, leaving one son, Anthony, educated in his own profession j and a daughter, Susanna, mentioned above","March, Canterbury",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"His abilities as a painter appear in his works, which will not only be admired by his contemporaries, but by their posterity ; as his tints, like those of Rubens and \ andyck, instead of being impaired, are improved by time, which some of them have now withstood above 60 years. His idea of beauty, when he indul¬ ged his fancy, was of the highest kind ; and his know¬ ledge of perspective gave him great advantages in fa¬ mily-pieces, of which he painted more than any one of his time. He could take a likeness by memory as well as by a sitting, as appears by his picture of the duke of Lor Pa in (the late emperor), which Faber engraved j and those of KJng George II. (in York assembly-room), Queen Caroline, the two Miss Gunnings, &c. Like many other great painters, he had “ a poet for his friend,” in the late Mr Browne j to which may be added a poem addressed to him in 1726, by the reve¬ rend Mr Bunce, at that time of Trinity-hall, Cam¬ bridge, who succeeded Mr Highmore, and in 1780 was vicar of St Stephen’s near Canterbury","York, Canterbury","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

He was advanced to the bishop¬ ric of Poictiers in the year 355, according to Baronius : and became a most zealous champion for the orthodox faith, particularly against the Arians, who were at that time gaining ground in France. He assembled seve¬ ral councils there, in which the determinations of the synods of Rimini and Seleucia were condemned. He wrote a treatise concerning synods j and a famous work in 12 books on the Trinity, which is much admired by the orthodox believers. He died in the latter end of the year 367.

"Hill, Aaron, a poet of considerable eminence, the son of a gentleman of Malmesbury-abbey in Wilt¬ shire, was born in 1685. His father’s imprudence having cut off his paternal inheritance, he left Westminster school at 14 years of age j and embarked for Constan¬ tinople, to visit Lord Paget the English ambassador there, who was his distant relation. Lord Paget recei¬ ved him with surprise and pleasure, provided him a tu¬ tor, and sent him to travel : by which opportunity he saw Egypt, Palestine, and a great part of the east; and returning home with his noble patron, visited most of the courts of Europe. About the year 1709, he pub¬ lished his first poem entitled Camillus, in honour of the earl of Peterborough who had been general in Spain j and being the same year made master of Drury-lane theatre, he wrote his first tragedy Elfred, or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master of the opera- house in the Hay-market $ when he wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which met with great success, being the first that Mr Handel set to music after he came to England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a pro¬ jector as well as poet, and in 17*5 obtained a patent for extracting oil from bcech-nuts ; which underta¬ king, whether good or bad, miscarried after engaging three years of his attention. He was also concerned in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia ; from which he never reaped any advantage ; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of Scotland, on a scheme of applying the woods there to ship-building 5 in which he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived in perfect harmony with all the writers of his time, except Mr Pope, with whom he had a short pa¬ per-war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the Dunciad, as one of the competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of Hulness, in the follow¬ ing lines: “ Then Hill essay’d $ scarce vanished out of sight, “ He buoys up instant, and returns to light ; “ He bears no token of the sabler streams, “ And mounts far off among the Swans of Thames.’, This, though far the gentlest piece of satire in the whole poem, and conveying at the same time an oblique complimeat, roused Mr Hill to take some notice of it ; which he did by a poem written during his peregrina¬ tion in the north, entitled, “ The Progress of Wit, a Caveat for the use of an eminent writer which he begins with the following eight lines, in which Mr Pope’s too well known disposition is elegantly, yet very severely characterized : ** Tuneful Alexis on the Thames’ fair side, “ The Ladies play-thing, and the Muses pride j “ With merit popular, with wit polite, “ Easy tho’ vain, and elegant tho’ light} “ Desiring and deserving others praise, “ Poorly accepts a Fame he ne’er repays : “ Unborn to cherish, sneakingly approves j “ And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves.” The sneakingly approves, in the last couplet, Mr Pope was much affected by; and indeed through their whole controversy afterwards, in which it was generally thought that Mr Hill had much the advantage, Mr Pope seems rather to express his repentance by denying the offence, than to vindicate himself supposing it to have been given. Besides the above poems, Mr Hill, among many others, wrote one, called The northern star, upon the actions of Czar Peter the Great; for which he was several years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from the empress Catharine, according to the Czar’s desire before his death. He likewise alter¬ ed some of Shakespeare’s plays, and translated some of Voltaire’s. His last production was Merope ; which was brought upon the stage in Drury-lane by Mr Gar¬ rick. He died on the 8th of February 1749, as it is said, in the very minute of the earthquake $ and af¬ ter his decease four volumes of his works in prose and verse were published in octavo, and bis dramatic works in two volumes","Westminster, Palestine, Peterborough","US,EG,ES,GE,GB,UK",6,"United States,Egypt,Spain,Georgia,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Africa,Europe,Asia,Europe,N/A"
"1746, he translated from the Greek, a small tract writ¬ ten by Theophrastus, on Gems, which he published by subscription j and which, being well executed, procured him friends, reputation, and money. Encouraged by this, he engaged in works of greater extent and import¬ ance. The first he undertook was a General Natural History, in 3 vols. folio. He next engaged, in conjunc¬ tion with George Lewis Scott, Esq. in furnishing a Supplement to Chambers’s Dictionary. He at the same time started the British Magazine j and while he was engaged in a great number of these and other works, some of which seemed to claim the continued attention of a whole life, he carried on a daily essay, under the title of Inspector. Amidst this hurry of business, Mr Hill was so laborious and ready in all his undertakings, and was withal so exact an econo¬ mist of his time, that he scarcely ever missed a public amusement for many years : where, while he relaxed from the severer pursuits of study, he gleaned up arti¬ cles of information for his periodical works. It would not be easy to trace Mr Hill, now Dr Hill (for he procured a diploma from the college of St Andrew’s), through all his various pursuits in life. A quarrel he had with the Boyal Society, for being refused as a member, which provoked him to ridicule that learned body, in A Review of the Works of the Royal Society of London, qto, 1751*, together with his over-writing himself upon all subjects without reserve ; made him sink in the estimation of the public nearly in the same pace as he had ascended. He found as usual, however, resources in his own invention. He applied himself to the preparation of certain simple medicines : such as the essence of water-dock, tincture of valerian, bal¬ sam of honey, &c.

Soon after the publication of the first of these medicines, be obtained the patronage of the earl of Bute, through whose interest lie acquired the management of the royal gardens at Kew, with an handsome salary : and to wind up the whole of an extraordinary life, having, a little before his death, seized an opportunity to intro¬ duce himself to the knowledge of the king of Sweden, that monarch invested him with one of the orders of bis court, which title he had not the happiness of en¬ joying above two years.

"No Hindoo is allowed to quit the cast in which he was born upon any account. All of them are very scrupulous with regard to their diet ; but the Bra¬ mins much more so than any of the rest. They eat no flesh, nor shed blood ; which we are informed by Porphyry and Clemens Alexandrinus was the case in their time. Their ordinary food is rice and other vegetables, dressed with ghee (a kind of butter melted and refined so as to be capable of being kept for a, long time), and seasoned with ginger and other spices",Bra,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"The food which they most esteem, however, is milk, as coming from the cow ; an animal for which they have the most extravagant veneration, insomuch that it is enacted in the code of Gentoo laws, that any one who exacts labour from a bullock that is hungry or thirsty, or that shall oblige him to labour when fa-, tigued or out of season, is liable to be fined by the ma¬ gistrates. The other casts, though less rigid, abstain very religiously from what is forbidden them ; nor will they eat any thing provided by a person of an inferior cast, or by one of a different religion. Though they may eat some kinds of flesh and fish, yet it is counted, a virtue to abstain from them all. None of them aie al¬ lowed to taste intoxicating liquor of any kind. Quin-l tus Curtins indeed mentions a sort of wine made use of by the Indians in his time ; but this is supposed to have been no other than toddy, or the unfermented juice, of the cocoa nut. This when fermented, affords a spirit of a very unwholesome quality ; but it is drunk only by the Cliandalas and the lower class of Europeans m the country.

An Hindoo who lies at the point °f will talk of his decease with the utmost composure j and if near the river Ganges, will desire to be carried out, that he may expire on its banks. Such is the ex¬ cessive veneration they have for their religion and cu¬ stoms, that no person will infringe them even to pre¬ serve his own life. An Hindoo, we are told, being ill of a putrid fever, was prevailed upon to send for an Eu¬ ropean physician, who prescribed him the bark in wine ; but this was refused with the greatest obstinacy even 3 0 2 'to H I N [ 476 ] H I h Hindoo?, to the very last, though the governor himself joined in ' ' liis solicitations, and in other matters had a considerable influence over him.

Some seapoys, in the British service, having been concerned in a mu¬ tiny, were condemned to be blown away from the mouths of cannon. Of these some were grenadiers, who cried out, that as they had all along had the post of honour, they saw no reason why they should be denied it now 5 and therefore desired that they might be blown away first.

"back part of their head, which they take great care to preserve. In Kashmere and some other places, they let their beards grow to the length of two inches.

"The metaphysics of the Bramins is much the same with that of some ancient Greek philosophers. I hey believe the human soul to be an emanation from the Deity, as light and heat from the sun. Gowtama, an ancient metaphysial), distinguishes two kinds of sculs, the divine and vital. The former resembles the eternal spirit from which it came, is immaterial, indivisible, and without passions $ the vital soul is a subtile element which pervades all things, distinct from organized mat¬ ter, and which is the origin of all our desires. i he external senses, according to this author, are represen¬ tations of external things to the mind, by which it is furnished with materials for its various operations 5 but unless the mind act in conjunction with the senses, the operation is lost, as in that absence of mind which takes place in deep contemplation. He treats likewise of reason, memory, perception, and other abstract subjects",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"The science for which the Bramins, however, were most remarkable, is that of astronomy j and in this their progress was so great, as even yet to furnish matter of admiration to the moderns.—The Europeans first be¬ came acquainted with the Indian astronomy in 1687, Hi„a0o«, from a Siamese MS. containing rules for calculating the ■ ^ < places of the sun and moon, brought home by M. Lou- bere the French ambassador at Siam. The principles on which the tables in this MS. were founded, however, proved to be so obscure, that it required the genius of Cassini to investigate them. The missionaries after¬ wards sent over two other sets of tables from Plindo- stan ; but no attention was paid to them till M. le Gen- til returned from observing the transit of Venus in 1769. During the time of his stay in Hindostan, the Bramins had been much more familiar with him on ac¬ count of his astronomical knowledge, than they usually were with Europeans; and he thus had an opportunity ol obtaining considerable insight into their methods of calculation.

Although M.

"For some short time the western provinces of India continued subject to the Syrian empire founded by Se¬ leucus ; but he quickly ceded these distant countries to one Sandrocottus, who gave him only 500 elephants in exchange. Soon after this the province of Bac- tria likewise became independent; and thus the con-> nection betwixt India and the western parts of the world y— was entirely dissolved, and we are almost entirely igno¬ rant of the transactions of that country till the time of the Mohammedan conquest. That the extensive country we now c&\\Hindostan was divided among many different nations, we have no reason to doubt ; hut Major Ren¬ nel is of opinion, that however this might be the case, there was generally a large empire or kingdom, which occupied the principal part of that immense valley through which the Ganges takes its course ; the capi¬ tal of which has fluctuated between Delhi and Patna, as the limits of the empire have varied. This was named the kingdom of the Prasij or Gangaridce in the times of Alexander and Megasthenes. Major Rennel is of opinion that it extended westward to the Panjab country ; and he also thinks it probable that the capi¬ tal named Palibothra stood on the same spot which is now occupied by the city of Patna. The kingdom, according to this supposition, would occupy part of Bengal ; and he thinks that it could not be less than that of France. It was on the borders of this king¬ dom that Alexander’s army mutinied and refused to proceed any farther. Arrian informs us, that the people were rich, excellent soldiers, and good husbandmen ; that they were governed by nobility, and that their rulers imposed nothing harsh upon them. ^ The Hindoos themselves pretend to an extravagant No ancle antiquity ; but we are informed by Major Rennel, that®IB^00J “ there is no known history of Hindostan (that rests on the foundation of Hindoo materials or records) ex¬ tant before the period of the Mohammedan conquests ; for either the Hindoos kept no regular histories, or they were all destroyed, or secluded from common eyes by the Pundits. We may judge of their traditions by that existing concerning Alexander’s expedition ; which is, that he fought a great battle with the emperor of H indostan near Delhi, and though victorious, retired to Persia across the northern mountains ; so that the remarkable circumstance of his sailing down the Indus, in which he employed many months, is sunk altoge¬ ther. And yet, perhaps, few events of ancient times rest on better foundations than this part of the history of Alexander, as appears by its being so highly cele¬ brated, not oidy by contemporaries, but by several ot the most eminent authors for some centuries following","Delhi, Patna, Patna, Delhi","IN,FR,SY",6,"India,France,Syrian Arab Republic","Asia,Europe,Asia"
"As he was prompted to this undertaking no less by a desire of exterminating the Hindoo religion than by that of conquest, a league was at last formed against him among all the Indian princes from the banks of the Ganges to the Nerbudda. Their allied forces, however, were defeated, and the year 1008 was mark¬ ed by the destruction of the famous temple of Nagra- cut in the Panjab country. Having satiated himself with plunder on this occasion, Mahmud returned to his own country $ but in ion invaded Hindostan once more, destroying Tanafar a city on the west of Delhi, and a more celebrated place of worship than Nagracut itself. Delhi was reduced on this occasion ; and in seven years after Canoge was taken ; the temples of Matra or Methura, the Methora of Pliny, a city of great antiquity, and remarkable for a place of worship near Agra, were likewise demolished ; but he failed in his attempts on the Rajpoots of Agimere, either through their own valour or the strength of their country. His twelfth expedition took place in the year 1024, when he destroyed the celebrated temple of Sumnaut in the peninsula of Guzerat, adjoining to the city of Puttan on the sea-coast, and not far from the island of Diu, now in the hands of the Portuguese. In this expedi¬ tion he proved very successful, reducing the whole peninsula of Guzerat, with many cities, the temples of which he constantly destroyed j and indeed seemed no less pleased with the overthrow of the Hindoo religion than with the conquest of the country. At his death, which happened in 1028, he was possessed of the east¬ ern and by far the largest part of Persia, and nominal¬ ly of all the provinces from the western part of the Ganges to the peninsula of Guzerat ; as well as those lying between the Indus and the mountains of Agi¬ mere j but the Rajpoots in that country still preserved their independency, which they have done all along, 7 even to the present time","Delhi, Delhi, Diu","IN,PT",6,"India,Portugal","Asia,Europe"
"After his death in 1205, the empire of Gazna was again divided ; and the Patan or Afghan empire was founded by Cuttub, who had the Indian part, the Per¬ sian remaining to Eldoze. Cuttub fixed his imperial residence at Delhi j and in 1210 the greatest part of Hindostan Proper was conquered bv the emperor Al- tumish, the successor of Cuttub. After his time the government of Bengal was always bestowed upon one of the reigning emperor’s sons j and during his reign the bloody conqueror Jenghiz Khan put an end to the other branch of the Gaznian empire, known by the name of IC/iarasm ; of which revolution an account is given under the article Gazna ; but Hindostan was at S that time left undisturbed. In 1242 the Moguls began inTa- to make irruptions into Hindostan, but did not at thissioB of the time make any permanent conquest. The country was now in much the same state in which it had been before the invasion of the Mohammedans, viz. divided into a great number of states tributary to the empe¬ ror, but in a great measure independent ; and which did not fail to revolt whenever a favourable opportu¬ nity offered. The kingdom of Malwa, which had been reduced by Cuttub in 1205, shook off the yoke in the year 1265, and the Rajpoots were on every oc¬ casion ready to revolt, notwithstanding that their coun¬ try lay in the neighbourhood of the capital. The most dreadful massacres, rebellions, and confusion^ now took place, which, from that period almost to the time that the British government commenced, made up the history of Hindostan. I he empire being parcelled out among a set of rapacious governors, the people were reduced to the last degree of misery, and were at last so far misled as to imagine that it was their interest to take up arms, in order to render tliese governors in¬ dependent. Had the emperors of Hindostan consulted their true interest, they would have given up the pro¬ vinces which lay beyond the upper part of the Indus and the deserts of Agimere ; as these formed a bar¬ rier which could not easily be passed by any invader",Delhi,"IN,AF,GB",6,"India,Afghanistan,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Europe"

He did not, however, disturb the succession to the throne, but left Mahmud in quiet possession of it, reserving to himself only that of the Panjab country. The death of Mahmud, which hap¬ pened in 1413, put an end to what is called the Patan dynasty, founded by Cuttub in 1205. He was suc¬ ceeded by Chizer, who derived hi§ pedigree from the impostor Mohammed, and his posterity continued to enjoy it till the year 1450 $ when Belloli, an Afghan of the tribe of Lodi, took possession of it, the reigning prince Alla H. having abdicated the government. Un¬ der him all Hindostan was divided into separate states; and a prince, whose title was the king of the east, who resided at Jionpour in the province of Allahabad, became so formidable, that the king of Delhi had only a shadow of authority remaining to him. A consi¬ derable part of the empire, however, was recovered by the son of Belloli ; who, in the year 1501, fixed his royal residence at Agra. During his reign the Portu¬ guese first accomplished the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, but they had no connection with any other part of Hindostan than some maritime places in the Deccan which had always been independent of the court of Delhi. In 1561, during the reign of Ibrahim II. matters fell into such confusion that Sul¬ tan Baber, a descendant of Tamerlane, found means to conquer a very considerable part of the empire","March, Lodi, Un, Delhi, Delhi","IN,GB,US,AF",6,"India,United Kingdom,United States,Afghanistan","Asia,Europe,North America,Asia"
"years of his reign were spent in reducing the provinces ' 11 r which had revolted from Agimere to Bengal ; and the obedience of these he took care to secure as well as possible by a careful choice of governors ; particularly by an unlimited toleration in religious matters, and an attention to the rights and privileges of the people. In 1585, he resolved to invade the Deccan, which had hitherto resisted the power of the Mogul princes. The war continued for 20 years ; during all which time no farther progress was made than the reduction of the western part of Berar, Candeish, Tellingana (a division of Golconda), and the northern part of Amednagur ; the capital of which, named also Amednagur, was taken in l6oi, after a long and bloody siege, and an unsuccess¬ ful attempt of the princes of the Deccan to relieve it. M Under his successor Jehan Guire, the project was but Bad eon- faintly carried on ; the empire was disturbed by the re-duet of hi* hellion of Shah Jehan the emperor’s son; and the jnflu-s,,cce®*®,,* ence of Noor Jehan his mistress perplexed the councils of the nation. In this prince’s reign Sir Thomas Roe, the first English ambassador, arrived at the court of Hin¬ dostan. The Portuguese had now acquired considerable possessions in Guzerat and Bengal, but only those in the former provinces attracted the attention of the court; so that the Persian historian takes no notice of those in Bengal. In the reign of Shah Jehan, who succeeded his father Jehan Guire in 1627, the conquest of the Deccan was more vigorously pushed than before ; and the war was carried on in such a destructive manner, that most of the princes in those parts were fain to make submission to the emperor. During this reign a war took place with the Portuguese, which ended in the ex¬ pulsion of the latter from Hoogly on the Ganges.

"This indeed may he looked upon as one of the prin¬ cipal causes by which the reputation of the British go¬ vernment in the eastern parts of the world has suflered', for as there were very frequently opinions diametrically opposite to one another recorded upon the same subject, the contending parties in the British parliament had always sufficient authority for what they said, let them take which side they would : and thus the characters of all concerned in the East India government were, by one person or other, set forth in the most opprobri¬ ous light",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"Another source of reproach to the British govern¬ ment in India was, that the court of directors in Eng¬ land became infested with the same spirit ot party and contention which pervaded all other departments ot the state. Lord Clive and Mr Sullivan were the two great leaders of these party disputes ; and as the in¬ terest of the one or the other prevailed, different per¬ sons were appointed to the administration, and differ¬ ent measures adopted. The event of all this was, that whenever a new administration was formed, the first object was to condemn the measures of those who had gone before him. Thus, in the year 1764* when Lord Clive was made governor of Bengal, the new di¬ rectors represented the affairs of the company as in the worst situation imaginable, from which they could on¬ ly be extricated by the abilities of Clive. On the ar¬ rival of the latter in the east, he took care to write home reports to the same purpose, and to condemn in the most violent manner every thing that had been done} the whole body of the company’s servants were censured indiscriminately without being allowed any means of defence, as they were in truth ignorant of the charges brought against them.

It now consisted of a gover¬ nor-general and four counsellors j three of whom were sent from England j two being military gentlemen of high rank, and the third a gentleman employed in the war-office. On their arrival they proceeded in the same manner that Lord Clive had done before them : they pronounced in the most decisive manner, that the company’s affairs were in a ruinous state j and that every species of corruption had been practised by the former government. This general accusation, unsup¬ ported by any kind of evidence, was the constant theme of the dispatches sent by them to England j and thus has the reputation of the British government suffered exceedingly through the unwarrantable liber¬ ties which its own servants have been allowed to take with one another. It must also be considered, that from the remote situation of India, and the unavoid¬ able ignorance of its affairs on that account, it was easy for any person, whose malicious purposes it might suit, to prejudice the public against the servants of the company Hi istan H I N company to as great a degree as he pleased",Clive,"IN,GB,US",6,"India,United Kingdom,United States","Asia,Europe,North America"
"It has not been uncommon, I am well assured, for the chief, that is, the first clerk of a factory, to order a peasant to plough up a rich field of poppies, and sow it with rice or some other grain. The pretence was to prevent a scarcity of provisions j but the real reason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price a large quantity of opium he had on hand. Upon other occasions the order has been reversed, and a rich field of rice or other grain has been ploughed up to make room for a plantation of poppies, when the chief saw that extraordinary profit was to be made by opium.” To this, however, the following answer has appeared in a late publication, entitled A short Review of the British government in India. “ The poppy is a plant which requires a peculiar soil, and particular care in the culture of it. The medium price of the land on which it is cultivated is about xi or 12 rupees abegah, or one-third of an English acre. It is sowed at the beginning of October, when the season of the perio¬ dical rain expires. The plant begins to be fit for in¬ cision, in order to extract its juice, of which opium is made, about the end of December, and continues so till March. It requires a dry soil, and can be brought to maturity only in the dry season, when the periodical rains have ceased. Paddy or rice lands let on a me¬ dium at three rupees a begah. Rice is sowed about the end of May, just before the periodical rains com¬ mence. One crop is raised about the end of Septem¬ ber j and another, which is the last, and by far the greatest, about the end of December. It requires a soil saturated with water, and lies soaked in it for a considerable time. On this account it is sowed just before the periodical rains commence; and nine-tenths of the quantity of rice produced in the company’s pro¬ vinces grow in the kingdom of Bengal, which is so low and flat, that the grounds are either overflowed by the rivers Ganges and Burrampooter, with their tributary streams, or soaked with the rain which falls and stag¬ nates upon them. It is therefore evident, that the soil and the season, which alone can fructify the paddy or rice, would rot and destroy the poppy j and it is there- C 493 1 H I N Hence fore as evident, that it is utterly impossible, from the Himlostan* nature of the two plants, that the one can be ploughed v——y——a up to sow the other.” With regard to the administration of the British af¬ fairs in the East Indies, it must also be remarked, that the company now act in a very different capacity from wh^t they originally did. From a society of mer¬ chants, they are now become sovereigns of the coun¬ try to which they trade. The latter character was quite foreign to them ; and they have accordingly look¬ ed upon that of merchants to be the principal one, while that of sovereigns was to be only a kind of ap¬ pendage to it. Thus, instead of acting for the interest of the country they govern, and which as sovereigns they naturally ought to do, they have acted in many cases directly opposite to it, which, as merchants, is also their natural interest. Hence also, when the ad¬ ministration in India did any thing in obedience to the orders of the directors, which orders being dictated by merchants, were prejudicial to the interests of the coun¬ try, that injury has been sometimes unjustly attributed to their servants, who acted merely in obedience to the orders they received. On the other hand, when the India administration acted with the generous spirit of sovereigns, they were sometimes blamed by the direc¬ tors, who judged as merchants, and sometimes by the ministry, who were always ready upon the smallest pre¬ tence to interfere in their affairs",March,"GB,IN,UK",6,"United Kingdom,India,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"
"At the time when the British administration first commenced in Hindostan, the Hindoo governors were universally named rajahs; but though many of the Hindoo families yet bear that title, it does not appear to resemble, in any manner of way, our titles of nobi¬ lity, or to be a dignity which can he conferred by any of the princes, or even by the Mogul himself. Hence, in that part of the world there are no ancient nobility, the titles being conferred merely by usurpers, who have neither right nor title derived from any thing but violence",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"From the consultations of the select committee in 1769, we are informed that the zemindars have a power of levying fines at pleasure; that they raise large sums from duties collected in the market; and that they frequently oblige the ryots or husbandmen to work for nothing. In short, the same claims made by the European barons on their vassals in the times of the feudal system, are now made by the zemindars on the common people of Hindostan. If one of them is to be married, if he has a child born, if honours are to be conferred upon him ; nay, if he is even to be fined for his own misconduct, the poor ryot must always contribute his share. Air Scrofton, in his hi¬ story of Hindostan, sets forth the situation of the in¬ habitants in the following words :—“ Unhappily for the Gentoos, themselves are made the ministers of op¬ pression over each other ; the Moor-men, haughty, lazy, and voluptuous, make them, of whom they have no jealousy, the ministers of their oppression, which further answers the end of dividing them, and prevents their uniting to fling off the yoke ; and by the strange intoxication of power, they are found still more rapa¬ cious and cruel than their foreign masters; and what is more extraordinary, the Bramins still exceed the rest in every abuse of power, and seem to think, if they bribe God by bestowing a part of their plun¬ der on cows and faquirs, their iniquities will be par¬ doned.” From this account of the situation of the people of ■Hindostan under their native rulers, it is by no means probable that they could make a worse exchange by falling under the jurisdiction either of the Mohammedans or Europeans. A notion indeed hath been industriously propagated, that the British government has behaved with the greatest cruelty in collecting the revenues and that they have even invented tortures to make the rich people discover their treasures; but on examining the matter impartially, the reverse of this is found to be true. At the time that the British government in- S terfered in the affairs of Hindostan, the provinces were Hindc found to be in a ruinous state, in consequence of thev wars which had taken place in the country. Even in the most settled state, and when the administration was most regular, the government was altogether despotic, and the mode of collecting its revenues extremely ar¬ bitrary ; the punishments inflicted very cruel ; and the whole system of government such as would be reckon¬ ed quite shocking in Europe. It is only within these few years that the British could effectually interpose in behalf of the natives; and in that short time it has produced a very considerable reformation. It is cer¬ tain, that the British government has discouraged op¬ pressive measures as much as possible ; abolished the cruel modes of punishment used by the Alohammedans; and by instituting a more regular plan of justice, has procured ease and security to the natives, and preserved them in a state of tranquillity altogether unknown to them before its commencement. Many instances of the greatest cruelty exercised upon the zemindars and other collectors are to be met with in the history of Bengal, written by a native historian, and translated by Gladwin : yet the person who exercised these cruel¬ ties w'as dignified with the titles of the faithful servant of the Empire, and the Glory of the State; which shows that the people were absolutely familiarised with cruel¬ ty, and did not know what it was to be under a lenient government. Since the British had the dominion, matters have been totally reversed, and the Hindoos, instead of being treated with cruelty, persecuted on account of their religion, and compelled to renounce it, have been used with at least comparative lenity, and great indulgence has been shown to them even in their most absurd practices and superstitions. When the Bri¬ tish government first accepted of the office of dewanny, or collector of the revenues, it was not in their power to interpose with any kind of efficacy for the relief of the inhabitants ; because it was at first thought pro¬ per to allow the taxes to be collected by natives, who would undoubtedly follow their ancient modes of col¬ lection. Even at that time, however, the mildness of the British governors had some effect upon the Asia¬ tics ; so that the people in general were treated with more lenity than formerly: and in the year 1772, when the council of Bengal openly assumed the office of dewan themselves, an immediate stop was put to all those arbitrary and oppressive methods which had been formerly in use. Formerly some zemindars had been flogged even to death, by an instrument called a korah : but from the moment that the British coun¬ cil took the collection into their own hands, not only this instrument was laid aside, but all kind of corpora! punishment; by which means the severity of tire Alohammedan government has been entirely abolish¬ ed, and no other punishments inflicted in cases of in¬ solvency than such as are in use in our own country",Asia,"GB,PH",6,"United Kingdom,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"Still, however, in such extensive dominions, where a great share of power must be one way or other com¬ mitted to the natives, it is impossible but some arbitrary acts must be committed, as the natives are always prone to acts of despotism whenever they can commit them with impunity; but examples of this kind cannot with any degree of candour be brought as a general charge against the British government in India.—Mr Scrofton gives the following account of the wretched state of H I N C 495 ] H I N istan. the provinces now under the British jurisdiction at the ——1 time they were ceded to them by the Mogul. “ When the governors of the provinces found the weakness of the Mogul, and each set up as sovereign in his own province, although they could not break through these immutable laws, they invented new taxes under new names, which doubled or trebled the value of the ori¬ ginal ones, and which the landholder was obliged to levy upon his tenants. The old stock of wealth for some time supported this; but when that failed, and the tenants were still pressed for more, they borrowed money of usurers at an exorbitant interest j and the go¬ vernment still continuing these demands, the lords of the lands were obliged to do the same : but as all this while the value ot lands did not increase, the con¬ sequence was, that at last, unable to pay the interest ot the mortgages, the rents were seized by rapacious usurers. The government finding the revenues fall shorter every year, at last sent collectors and farmers of the revenues into the provinces. Thus the lord of the land was divested of power over his country, and the tenants exposed to merciless plunderers j till the farmer and manufacturer, finding that the more they laboured the more they paid, the manufacturer would work no more, and the farmer would cultivate no more than was just sufficient for the subsistence of his family",,"GB,IN",6,"United Kingdom,India","Europe,Asia"
"Thus this once flourishing and plentiful country has, in the course of a few years, been reduced to such mi¬ sery, that many thousands are continually perishing through want. T-he crown lands are still worse off, let out to the highest bidder; and the Jagheer lands alone remain unplundered. Hence that equal distri¬ bution of wealth that makes the happiness of a people, and spreads a face of cheerfulness and plenty through all ranks, has now ceased ; and the riches of the coun¬ try are settled partly in the hands of a few usurers and greedy courtiers, and the rest is carried out of the country by the foreign troops taken into pay to maintain the governors in their usurpations. This unhappy decay the India company has already experienced in the de¬ cay of their trade, and the rise and price of their manu¬ factures ; and will, I fear, experience more and more annually.” With regard to the depositions of the nabobs by the British, which has been used as a great argument against the general spirit of British government in those parts, it must be remembered, in the first place, that these nabobs were mere usurpers, who had not the least title to their dominions, and consequently could not, in point of right, complain more reasonably of being deprived of their dominions, tliian the persons from whom they had taken them might do of their in¬ justice in driving them out. Their behaviour in government also was such, that it was impossible it could have subsisted for any length of time without the absolute ruin of the countries they possessed. Thus, in the case of Jaffier Ally Cawn, Mr Vansittart de¬ clared the country to be in so confused and im¬ poverished a state, that in all human appearance an¬ other month could not have been run through before he would have been cut off by his own seapoys for want of pay, and the city become a scene of plunder and disorder. On this account he was degraded, though without any of those circumstances of cruelty which generally characterise the revolutions in this part of the world.

"An account of his proceedings has already been given ; but whatever applause he might gain, and in some respects deservedly at the time, it is now said with some probability, that he raised the expectations of the people of England by far too high. The seeds of the succeeding evils were already sown. Many sources of wealth were dried up. Raw silk, cloths, and other manufactures, had formerly been exported to Guzerat, Lahore, and even Ispahan. This had ceased on the invasion of Nadir Shah ; and the influx of wealth from the European nations had ceased before the British government in Bengal had an existence. It was com¬ puted that Cossim Aly Cawn robbed the country of near five millions sterling in jewels and specie. China, Madras, and Bombay, were supplied from Bengal to the amount of more than two millions ; and several other circumstances besides these contributed to dimi¬ nish the riches and opulence of the country. In the mean time the internal administration of the country had been extremely defective. The zemindars being under very little restraint, acted in a very arbitrary manner within their own districts; and the tenants had no redress against the impositions and exactions which were laid upon them. Meer Cossim appointed annuls to the collection of the revenues rather than zemindars",Lahore,"CN,PK,GB",6,"China,Pakistan,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Europe"
"The aumils derive their authority directly from the person who has the command of the country for the present time, and consequently are more easily called to an account than the zemindars. At last, how¬ ever, these aumils, having obtained too great an in¬ fluence in the country, Lord Clive thought proper to change the plan of collection. Three natives were now appointed, in the nabob’s name, to superintend this department; and one English gentleman, through whom the business was transacted, had his residence at the nabob’s court, and communicated the intelligence to Calcutta. The principal acting minister in this plan, however, thought proper to change the mode of collection once more, and to re-appoint the aumils; , in consequence of which the revenne became greatly diminished, and they were besides complained of as greatly oppressing the people. To remedy these evils, it was first proposed by Mr Verelst, to send some of the company’s servants into the internal parts of the country with the title of supervisors: but the defects of administration were now beyond their power to re¬ medy; the revenue was not only greatly diminished, but the expence of government exceedingly augmented ; and in the year 1771 ^le company were alarmed by accounts that bills had been drawn upon them to the amount of 1,200,000!. At this time Mr Hastings was appointed to be governor of Bengal; and the con¬ fused state in which matters were at the commencement of bis administration will easily appear from the following extract of a letter from the government of Bengal, dated in the month of November 1772.—“Every zemindary was left to its own particular customs* The articles which , H IN [ 495 ] H I N Hindustan which composed the revenue, the form of keeping the ed a disposition to oppress, rather than to relieve, the Hindustan ^ »—ly!—i accounts, the computation of time, even the techni- oppressed inhabitants oi Hindostan.

The Hindoos themselves acknowledge this, and are as well pleased with the mildness of the British government, as they are displeased with the superstition and cruelty of the Mohammedans. Under the British government we cannot suppose but that commerce, to which the inhabitants of this country are so much ad¬ dicted, will be much more encouraged than by the ava¬ ricious and barbarous Mohammedans. The latter had imposed so many restraints upon trade of all kinds, by the multitude of taxes collected at the landing-places, watch-houses, markets, &c. that it was almost impos¬ sible to carry it on with any advantage. Among other salutary regulations, however, enacted by the British government in 1772, many of those taxes upon com¬ merce were abolished, and a plan laid for efFectually li¬ berating the inhabitants from those shackles by which their commerce had been so long fettered.—Regard has also been paid to the instruction of the people in useful knowledge •, and the seminary established at Cal¬ cutta by Sir William Jones, certainly does much ho¬ nour to the founder. Some regard had indeed been paid to this by the Mohammedan emperors ; but at the time that the British government commenced, these had been entirely neglected, their endowments re¬ sumed by government, and even the buildings fallen into ruin.” From-a comparison of any government to which the Hindoos have hitherto been subject, with that of Bri¬ tain, indeed, it is evident that the preference must be given greatly in favour of the latter. At the time when the British first visited that country, they were not under the jurisdiction of their native sovereigns, nor had they been so for a long time before. The Moguls were not only foreigners, but a most cruel and detest¬ able race of men ; and it was by usurpations of their own rebellious subjects that the anarchy and confusion was introduced, in which the country was involved for so long a time. The British are foreigners as well as the Moguls; but the latter, who profess the intolerant superstition of Mohammed, suffer their conduct to be influenced by it in such a manner as to treat the natives with the utmost cruelty. The greatest evil perhaps which results from the British government is, the ex¬ portation of great sums of money to a foreign country $ hut this evil, with respect to the provinces possessed by the British, existed also under theMohammedan govern¬ ment. The Mogul emperors resided at Delhi, which is far distant from the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, the territories now possessed by Britain j so that the greatest part of the treasure sent to that capital was totally lost to them. In the time of Aureng-zebe, the emperor’s ti’ibute amounted to three millions ster¬ ling ; and of this a considerable part was specie 5 but since that time the tribute was fixed at only 1,250,000!",Delhi,"GB,IN,UK",6,"United Kingdom,India,N/A","Europe,Asia,N/A"

But Hippocrates, as soon as he ar¬ rived, pronounced the disease to be entirely mental, as in truth it was.

Hippocrates had also public invitations to other countries. Thus, when a plague invaded the Illyrians and Paeonians, the kings of those countries begged him to come to their relief: he did not go ; but learning from the messen¬ gers the course of the winds there, he concluded that the distemper would come to Athens; and foretelling what would happen, applied himself to take care of the city and the students. He was indeed such a lover of Greece, that when his fame had reached as far as Per¬ sia, and upon that account Artaxerxes had intreattd him by his governor of the Hellespont, with a pro¬ mise of great rewards, to come to him, he refused to go. He also delivered his own country from a war with the Athenians, that was just ready to break out, by prevailing with the Thessalians to come to their as¬ sistance, for which he received very great honours from the Coans. The Athenians also conferred great honours upon him : they admitted him next to Her¬ cules in the Eleusinian ceremonies ; gave him the free¬ dom of the city ; and voted a public maintenance for him and his family in the prytaneum or council-house at Athens, where none were maintained at the public charge, but such as had done public service to the state","Athens, Athens","US,GR",6,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

Thus, for instance, a per¬ son may know the Roman history from the time of Romulus, without knowing in the least why the city ot Rome happened to be built at that time. This cannot be understood without a particular knowledge of the former state of Italy, and even of Greece and Asia; $ zt.

At this time Greece was divided into a number of small principalities, most of which seem to have been in subjection to Agamem¬ non king of Mycenae.

"In 740 B. C. however, the Syrian empire was totally destroyed by Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria ; as was also the kingdom of Samaria by Shalmaneser his suc¬ cessor in 721 B. C. The people were either massacred, or carried into captivity into Media, Persia, and the countries about the Caspian sea. 15 While the nations of the east were thus destroying Of the each other, the foundations of very formidable em- Western pires were laid in the west, which in process of timeIlallons' were to swallow up almost all the eastern ones. In Africa, Carthage was founded by a Tyrian colony, about 869 B. C. according to those who ascribe the highest antiquity to that city ; but, according to others, it was founded only in 769 or 770 B. C. In Europe a very considerable revolution took place about 900 B. C. The Heraclidae, whom we have formerly seen expelled from Greece by Atreus the father of Aga¬ memnon, after several unsuccessful attempts, at last conquered the whole Peloponnesus. From this time the Grecian states became more civilized, and their hi¬ story becomes less obscure. The institution, or rather the revival and continuance, of the Olympic games, in 776 B. C. also greatly facilitated the writing not only of their history, but that of other nations ; for as each Olympiad consisted of four years, the chronology of every important event became indubitably fixed by re¬ ferring it to such and such an Olympiad.

"I he year 403 B. C. proved remarkable for the re¬ volt of Cyrus against his brother Artaxerxes Memnon* in which, through his own rashness, he miscarried, and lost his life at the battle of Cunaxa, in the province of aQ Babylon. Ten thousand Greek mercenaries, who served Xenophon’* in his army, made their way back into Greece, thoughretreat* surrounded on all sides by the enemy, and in the heart of a hostile country. In this retreat they were com¬ manded by Xenophon, who has received the highest praises on account of his conduct and military skill in bringing it to a happy conclusion. Two years after, the invasions of Agesilaus king of Sparta threatened the Persian empire with total destruction ; from which, however, it was relieved by his being recalled in order to defend his own country against the other Grecian states j and after this the Persian affairs continued ins a more prosperous way till the time of Alexander. 2J During all this time, the volatile and giddy temper History of of the Greeks, together with their enthusiastic desiretlie Greek*, of romantic exploits, were preparing fetters for them¬ selves, which indeed seemed to be absolutely necessary to prevent them from destroying one another. A zeal for liberty was what they all pretended ; but on every occasion it appeared, that this love of liberty was only a desire of dominion. No state in Greece could bear to see another equal to itself j and hence their perpetual contests for pre-eminence, which could not but weaken the whole body, and render them an easy prey to an ambitious and politic prince, who was capable of taking advantage of those divisions. Bmg all equally impatient of restraint, they never could bear to submit to any regular government; and hence their determi¬ nations were nothing but the decisions of a mere mob, ot which they had afterwards almost constantly reason ; to repent. Hence also their base treatment of those eminent men whom they ought most to have honoured; as Miltiades, Aristides, Themistocles, Alcibiades, So¬ crates, Phocion, &c. The various transactions be¬ tween the Grecian states, though they make a very considerable figure in particular history, make none at all in a general sketch of the history of the world. We shall therefore only observe, that in 404 B. C. the A- thenian power was in a manner totally broken by the taking HISTORY",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"taking of tlieir city by the Spartans. In 370 B. C. that of the Spartans received a severe check from the Ibebans at the battle of Leuctra ; and eight years after was still further reduced by the battle of Mantinea. Epa- minondas the great enemy of the Spartans was killed ; but this only proved a more speedy means of subju¬ gating all the states to a foreign, and at that time despicable, power. 1 he Macedonians, a barbarous nation, lying to the north of the states of Greece, were two years after the death of Epaminondas reduced to the lowest ebb by the Illyrians, another nation of bar¬ barians in the neighbourhood. The king of Macedon being killed in an engagement, Philip his brother de¬ parted from Thebes, where he had studied the art of war under Epaminondas, in order to take possession of his kingdom. Being a man of great prudence aud poli¬ cy, he quickly settled his own affairs ; vanquished the Illyrians •, and being no stranger to the weakened situa¬ tion of Greece, began almost immediately to meditate the conquest of it. The particulars of this enterprise are related under the article Macedon : here it is suf¬ ficient to take notice, that by first attacking those he was sure he could overcome, by corrupting those whom he thought it dangerous to attack, by sometimes pre¬ tending to assist one state and sometimes another, and by imposing upon all as best served his turn, he at last put it out of the power of the Greeks to make anv resistancej at least such as could keep him from earning his end. In 338 B. C. he procured himself to be elected general of the Amphictyons, or council of the Grecian states, under pretence of settling some troubles at that time in Greece j but having once ob¬ tained liberty to enter that country with an army, he quickly convinced the states that they must all submit to his will. He was opposed by the Athenians and Thebans 5 but the intestine wars of Greece had cut off all her great men, and no general was now to be found capable of opposing Philip with success",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"The king of Macedon, being now master of all Greece, projected the conquest of Asia. To this he was encouraged by the ill success which had attended the Persians in their expeditions against Greece, the successes of the Greeks in their invasions, and the re¬ treat of the ten thousand under Xenophon. All these events showed the weakness of the Persians, their vast inferiority to the Greeks in military skill, and how ea¬ sily their empire might be overthrown by a proper union among the states",Asia,"GR,PH",6,"Greece,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"The Asiatics have in all ages been much inferior to the European nations in valour and military skill. They were now sunk in luxury and effeminacy $ and what was worse, they seem at this period to have been seized with that infatuation and distraction of councils which scarce ever fails to be a forerunner of the destruction of any nation. The Persian ministers persuaded their sovereign to reject the prudent advice that was given Sect. I him, of distressing Alexander by laying waste the conn- £jTii try, and thus forcing him to return for want of provi- History, sions. Nay, they even prevented him from engaging the enemy in the most proper manner, by dividing his forces ; and persuaded him to put Charidemus the A- thenian to death, who had promised with 100,000 men, of whom one-third were mercenaries, to drive the Greeks out of Asia. In short, Alexander met with only two checks in his Persian expedition. The one was from the city of Tyre, which for seven months re¬ sisted his utmost efforts; the other was from Memnon the Rhodian, who had undertaken to invade Macedo¬ nia. The first of these obstacles Alexander at last got over, and treated the governor and inhabitants with the utmost cruelty. The other was scarce felt; for Memnon died after reducing some of the Grecian islands, and Darius had no other general capable of conducting the undertaking. The power of the Per¬ sian empire was totally broken by the victory gained over Darius at Arbela in 331 B. C. and next year a total end was put to it by the murder of the king by Bessus one of his subjects. 55 The ambition of Alexander was not to be satisfied H*8 con- with the possession of the kingdom of Persia, or indeed^|, °ft of any other on earth. Nothing less than the total ^5 subjection of the word itself seemed sufficient to him ; and therefore he was now prompted to invade every country of which he could only learn the name, whe¬ ther it had belonged to the Persians or not. In con¬ sequence of this disposition, he invaded and reduced Hy rcania, Bactria, Sogdia, and all that vast tract of country now called Bukharia. At last, having entered India, he reduced all the nations to the river Hypha- sis, one of the branches of the Indus. But when he would have proceeded farther, and extended his con¬ quests quite to the eastern extremities of Asia, his troops positively refused to follow him farther, and he was constrained to return. In 323 B. C. this mighty conqueror died of a fever ; without having time to settle the affairs of his vast extended empire, or even to name his successor. . ^ While the Grecian empire thus suddenly sprung np^81^ in the east, the rival states of Rome and Carthage iveremans making considerable advances in the west. The Ro¬ mans were establishing their empire on the most solid foundations ; to which their particular situation natu¬ rally contributed. Being originally little better than a parcel of lawless banditti, they were despised and hated by the neighbouring states. This soon produced wars; in which, at first from accidental circumstances, and af¬ terwards from their superior valour and conduct, the Romans proved almost constantly victorious. The jea¬ lousies which prevailed among the Italian states, and their ignorance of their true interest, prevented them from combining against that aspiring nation, and crush¬ ing it in its infancy, which they might easily have done ; while in the mean time the Romans being kept in a state of continual warfare, became at last such ex¬ pert soldiers, that no other state on earth could resist them. During the time of their kings they had made a very considerable figure among the Italian nations; but after their expulsion, and the commencement ot the republic, their conquests became much more rapid and extensive.

The Romans, however, still got the better of their ene¬ mies j but, even at the time of the celebrated Camil- lus’s death, which happened about 352 B. C. their territories scarce extended six or seven leagues from the capital. The republic from the beginning was agitated by those dissensions which at last proved its ruin. The people had been divided by Romulus into two classes, namely, Patr icians and Plebeians, answer¬ ing to our nobility and commonalty. Between these two bodies were perpetual jealousies and contentions ; which retarded the progress of the Roman conquests, and revived the hopes of the nations they had conquer¬ ed. The tribunes of the people were perpetually op¬ posing the consuls and military tribunes. The senate had often recourse to a dictator endowed with absolute power; and then the valour and experience of the Ro¬ man troops made them victorious j but the return of domestic seditions gave the subjugated nations an op¬ portunity of shaking off the yoke. Thus had the Romans continued for near 400 years, running the same round of wars with the same enemies, and reap¬ ing very little advantage from their conquests, till at last matters were compounded by choosing one of the consuls from among the plebeians; and from this time chiefly we may date the prosperity of Rome, so that by the time that Alexander the Great died they were held in considerable estimation among foreign nations","Rome, Romulus, Roman, Rome","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"Gar- The Carthaginians in the mean time continued to ians, enrich themselves by commerce $ but, being less con- Si- versant in military affairs, were by no means equal to the Romans in power, though they excelled them in wealth. A new state, however, makes its appearance during this period, which may be said to have taught the Carthaginians the art of war, and, by bringing them into the neighbourhood of the Romans, proved the first source of contention between these two power¬ ful nations. This was the island of Sicily. At what time people were first settled on it, is not now to be ascertained. The first inhabitants we read of were called Sicani, Siculi, Leestrigones, &c. but of these we know little or nothing. In the second year of the 17th Olympiad, or 710 B. C. some Greek colonies are said to have arrived on the island, and in a short time founded several cities, of which Syracuse was the chief. The Syracusans at last subdued the original inhabitants: though it doth not appear that the lat¬ ter were ever well affected to their government, and therefore were on all occasions ready to revolt. The first considerable prince, or (as he is called by the Greeks) tyrant of Syracuse, was Gelon, who obtained the sovereignty about the year 483 B. C. At what time the Carthaginians first carried their arms into Si¬ cily is not certainly known j only we are assured, that Vql. X. Part II. f 513 they possessed some part of the island as early as 505 B.

Whence it appears, that the dominion of Carthage already extend¬ ed over Sardinia and part of Sicily : but in 28 years after, they had been totally driven out by Gelon : which probably was the first exploit performed by him","Syracuse, Syracuse, Carthage, Carthage","US,TN,GR",6,"United States,Tunisia,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"

It is proper also to observe, that af¬ ter the destruction of Tyre by Alexander the Great, almost all the commerce in the western part of the world fell to the share of th.e Carthaginians. Whether they had at this time made any settlements in Spain is not known.

"at the same time ready to fall to pieces for want of a proper head j the western world filled with fierce and savage nations, whom the rival republics of Carthage and Rome were preparing to enslave as fast as they could.

It is not to be supposed that peace could long be preserved in such a situation.

Ihe two most powerful and permanent empires, however, were those of Syria founded by Seleucus, and Egypt by Ptolemy Lagos. The kings of Macedon, though they did not preserve the same authority over the Grecian states that Alexander, Antipater, and Cassander, had done, yet effectually prevented them from those outrages up- on one another, for which they had formerly been so remarkable. Indeed, it is somewhat difficult to deter¬ mine, whether their condition was better or worse than before they were conquered by Philip; since, though they were now prevented from destroying one another, they were most grievously oppressed by the Macedonian tyrants",Lagos,"MK,GR,AM,SY,EG,PT",6,"North Macedonia,Greece,Armenia,Syrian Arab Republic,Egypt,Portugal","Europe,Europe,Asia,Asia,Africa,Europe"

Being invited into Sicily to assist the Mamer- tines against Hiero king of Syracuse and the Car¬ thaginians, they immediately commenced a war with the latter, which continued with the utmost fury for 23 years. The war ended greatly to the disadvantage of the Carthaginians, chiefly owing to the bad con¬ duct of their generals, none of whom, Hamilcar Bar¬ cas alone excepted, seem to have been possessed of any degree of military skill *, and the state had suffered too many misfortunes before he entered upon the command, for him or any other to retrieve it at that time. The consequence of this war was the entire loss of Sicily to the Carthaginians ; and soon after the Romans seized on the island of Sardinia",Syracuse,"IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"Hamilcar perceiving that there was now no alter¬ native, but that in a short time either Carthage must conquer Rome, or Rome would conquer Carthage, bethought himself of a method by which his country might become equal to that haughty republic. This was by reducing all Spain, in which the Carthaginians had already considerable possessions, and from the mines of which they drew great advantages. He had, therefore, no sooner finished the war with the mercenaries, which succeeded that with the Romans, than he set about the conquest of Spain. This, how¬ ever, he did not live to accomplish, though he made great progress in it. His son Asdrubal continued the war with success j till at last the Romans, jealous of O R Y.

"The transactions of the second Punic war are perhaps the most remarkable which the history of the world can afford. Certain it is, that nothing can show more clearly the slight foundations upon which the greatest empires are built. We now see the Romans, the na¬ tion most remarkable for their military skill in the whole world, and who, for more than 500 years, had been constantly victorious, unable to resist the efforts of one single man. At the same time we see this man, though evidently the first general in the world, lost solely for want of a slight support. In former times, the republic of Carthage supplied her generals in Si¬ cily with hundreds of thousands, though their enter¬ prises were almost constantly unsuccessful j but now Hannibal, the conqueror of Italy, was obliged to abandon his design, merely for want of 20 or 30,000 men. That degeneracy and infatuation, which never fails to overwhelm a falling nation, or rather which is the cause of its fall, had now infected the counsels of Carthage, and the supplies were denied. Neither was Carthage the only infatuated nation at this time.—» Hannibal, whose prudence never forsook him either in prosperity or adversity, in the height of his good fortune had concluded an alliance with Philip king of Macedon.

The Syrian empire was now governed by Antiochus the Great, who seems to have had little right to such a title","Carthage, Hannibal, Zama","EG,SY,GR,TN,US,JP",6,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic,Greece,Tunisia,United States,Japan","Africa,Asia,Europe,Africa,North America,Asia"
"His empire, though diminished by the defection of the Parthians, was still very powerful j and to him Hannibal *9 C Greece",Hannibal,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"Antiochus, however, had not sufficient judgment to see the necessity of following that great man’s advice} nor would the Carthaginians be prevailed upon to contribute their assistance against the nation which was soon to destroy them without any provo¬ cation. The pretence for war on the part of the Ro¬ mans was, that Antiochus would not declare his Greek, subjects in Asia to be free and independent states; a requisition which neither the Romans nor any other nation had a right to make. The event of all was, that Antiochus was everywhere defeated, and forced to conclude a peace upon very disadvantageous terms",Asia,"PH,GR",6,"Philippines,Greece","Asia,Europe"
"In Europe, matters went on in the same way ; the states of Greece, weary of the tyranny of the Mace¬ donians, entered into a resolution of recovering their liberties. For this purpose was framed the Achaean * iGwcf League * $ but as they could not agree among them¬ selves, they at last came to the imprudent determination of calling in the Romans to defend them against Philip king of Macedon. This produced a war, in which the Romans were victorious. The Macedonians, how¬ ever, were still formidable ; and as the intention of the Romans to enslave the whole world could no longer be doubted, Perseus, the successor of Philip, renewed the war. Through his own cowardice he lost a decisive engagement, and with it his kingdom, which submitted to the Romans in 167 B. C",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"I ruction Macedon being thus conquered, the next step was 0 mhage utterly to exterminate the Carthaginians j whose re- ‘ jGo' public, notwithstanding the many disasters that had befallen it, was still formidable. It is true, the Car¬ thaginians were giving no offence ; nay, they even made the most abject submissions to the republic of Rome; but all was not sufficient. War was declared a third time against that unfortunate state $ there was now no Hannibal to command their armies, and the city was utterly destroyed 146 B. C. The same year the Ro¬ mans put an end to the liberties they had pretended to grant the cities of Greece, by the entire destruction of 31 Corinth.

So far indeed were they from taking any means to secure themselves against the overgrown power of that republic, that the kings both of Syria and Egypt sometimes applied to the Romans as pro¬ tectors. Their downfal, however, did not happen within the period of which we now treat.—The only other transaction which makes any considerable figure m the Syrian empire is the oppression of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanes. After their return from the Babylonish captivity, they continued in subjection to the Persians till the time of Alexander.—From that time they were subject to the kings of Egypt or Syria, as the fortune of either happened to prevail.

"This revolution, however, was of no long continu¬ ance. In 167 B. C. Mattathias restored the true worship in most of the cities of Judea ; and in 168 the temple was purified, and the worship there restored by Judas Maccabseus. This was followed by along series of wars between the Syrians and Jews, in which the latter were almost always victorious ; and before these wars were finished, the destruction of Carthage happen¬ ed, which puts an end to the sixth general period for¬ merly mentioned. 32 7. The beginning of the seventh period presents us Seventh pe- with a view of the ruins of the Greek empire in the declining states of Syria and Egypt j both of them of^ much circumscribed in bounds. The empire of Syria world, at first comprehended all Asia to the river Indus, and beyond it j but in 312 B. C. most of the Indian pro¬ vinces were by Seleucus ceded to one Sandrocottus, or Androcottus, a native, who in return gave him 500 elephants. Of the empire of Sandrocottus we know nothing farther than that he subdued all the countries between the Indus and the Ganges ; so that from this time we may reckon the greatest part of India inde¬ pendent on the Syro-Macedonian princes. In 250 B. C. however, the empire sustained a much greater loss by the revolt of the Parthians and Bactrians from Antiochus Theus. The former could not be subdued j and as they held in subjection to them the vast tract which now goes under the name of Persia, we must look upon their defection as an irreparable loss. Whe¬ ther any part of their country was afterwards recover¬ ed by the kings of Egypt or Syria is not very certain ; nor is it of much consequence, since we are assured that in the beginning of the seventh period, i. e. 146 B. C. the Greek empires of Syria and Egypt were reduced by the loss of India, Persia, Armenia, Pon- tus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Pergamus, &c. The ge¬ neral state of the world in 146 B. C. therefore was as follows. In Asia were the empires of India, Par- thia, and Syria, with the lesser states of Armenia, Pontus, &c. above mentioned j to which we must add that of Arabia, which during the sixth period had grown into some consequence, and had maintained its independency from the days of Ishmael the son of Abraham. In Africa were the kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia; the Carthaginian territories now sub¬ ject to the Romans ; and the kingdoms of Numidia, Mauritania, and Getulia, ready to be swallowed up by the same ambitious and insatiable power, now that Carthage was destroyed, which served as a barrier a- gainst it. To the south lay some unknown and bar¬ barous nations, secure by reason of their situation and insignificance, rather than their strength, or distance from Rome. In Europe we find none to oppose the progress of the Roman arms, except the Gauls, Ger- 3 T 2 mans, 5i6 Civil History","Carthage, Asia, Of, Carthage, Rome, Roman","SY,EG,IN,AM,TN,GR,ET,MR,PH,TR,US,RO",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,Egypt,India,Armenia,Tunisia,Greece,Ethiopia,Mauritania,Philippines,Turkey,United States,Romania","Asia,Africa,Asia,Asia,Africa,Europe,Africa,Africa,Asia,Asia,North America,Europe"
"HIST mans, and some Spanish nations. These were brave in¬ deed j but through want of military skill, incapable of contending with such masters in the art of war as the Romans then were",,ES,6,Spain,Europe
"The Spaniards had indeed been subdued by Scipio Africanus in the time of the second Punic war : but, in 155 B. C. they revolted ; and, under the conduct of one Viriathus, formerly a robber, held out for a long time against all the armies the Romans could send into Spain. Him the consul Csepio caused to be murdered about 138 B. C. because he found it impos¬ sible to reduce him by force. The city of Numantia defied the whole Roman power for six years longer 5 till at last, by dint of treachery, numbers, and perse¬ verance, it was not taken, but the inhabitants, re¬ duced to extremity by famine, set lire to their houses, and perished in the flames or killed one another, so that not one remained to grace the triumph of the conqueror : and this for the present quieted the rest of the Spaniards. About the same time Attalus, king of Pergamus, left by will the Roman people heirs to all his goods ; upon which they immediately seized on his kingdom as part of those goods, and reduced it to a Roman province, under the name of Asia Proper. Thus they continued to enlarge their dominions on every side, without the least regard to justice, to the means they employed, or to the miseries they brought upon the conquered people. In 122 B. C. the Balearic islands, now called Majorca, Minorca, and Ivica, were subdu¬ ed, and the inhabitants exterminated j and soon after, several of the nations beyond the Alps were obliged to submit","Roman, Roman, Roman","RO,ES",6,"Romania,Spain","Europe,Europe"
"Aristobulus, being defeated by the party qf Hyrca- nus, applied to the Romans. Pompey the Great, who acted as ultimate judge in this affair, decided it against Aristobulus, but at the same time deprived Hyrcanus of all power as a king ; not allowing him even to assume the regal title, or to extend his terri¬ tory beyond the ancient borders of Judea. To such a length did Pompey carry this last article, that he obli¬ ged him to give up all those cities in Coslosyria and Phoenicia which had been gained by his predecessors, and added them to the newly acquired Roman province of Syria",Roman,"SY,RO",6,"Syrian Arab Republic,Romania","Asia,Europe"
"Thus the Romans became masters of all the eastern parts ef the world, from the Mediterranean sea to the borders of Parthia. In the west, however, the Gauls were still at liberty, and the Spanish nations bore the Roman yoke with great impatience. The Gauls infest¬ ed the territories of the republic by their frequent in¬ cursions, which were sometimes very terrible j and though several attempts had been made to subdue them, they always proved insufficient till the time of Julius Ccesar. By him they were totally reduced, from the ri¬ ver Rhine to the Pyrentean mountains, and many of their nations almost exterminated. He carried his arms also into Germany and the southern parts of Bri¬ tain ; but in neither of these parts did he make any permanent conquests. The civil wars between him and Pompey gave him an opportunity of seizing on the kingdom of Mauritania and those parts of Numi¬ dia which had been allowed to retain their liberty",Roman,"DE,MR,RO,ES",6,"Germany,Mauritania,Romania,Spain","Europe,Africa,Europe,Europe"
"The kingdom of Egypt alone remained, and to this nothing belonged except the country properly so call¬ ed. Cyrenaica was bequeathed by will to the Romans about 58 B. C. $ and about the same time the island of Cyprus was seized by them without any pretence, ex¬ cept a desire of possessing the treasure ot the king.— The kingdom of Egypt continued for some time longer at liberty j which in some measure must be ascribed to the internal dissensions of the republic, but more especially to the amours of Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony, with the famous Cleopatra queen of Egypt. The battle of Actium, however, deter¬ mined the fate of Antony, Cleopatra, and Egypt it¬ self ; which last was reduced to a Roman province about 9 B. C. 34 While the Romans thus employed all means to re-Origin am duce the world to their obedience, they were ma- progressc king one another feel the same miseries at home which1 they inflicted upon other Rations abroad. The firstRonie civil dissensions took their rise at the siege of Numan¬ tia in Spain. We have already observed, that this small city resisted the whole power of the Romans for six years. Once they gave them a most terrible and shame¬ ful defeat, wherein 30,000 Romans fled before 4000 Numantines. Twenty thousand were killed in the battle, and the remaining ten thousand so shut up, that there was no possibility of escaping. In this ex¬ tremity they were obliged to negociate with the ene¬ my, and a peace was concluded upon the following terms: 1. That the Numantines should suffer theRomans to retire unmolested j and, 2.

The fate of Numantia, however, was soon revenged. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, brother-in-law to Scipio Africanus the se¬ cond, had been a chief promoter of the peace with the Numantines already mentioned, and of consequence had been in danger of being delivered up to them along with the commander in chief. This disgrace he never forgot; and, in order to revenge himself, under¬ took the cause of the plebeians against the patricians, by whom the former were greatly oppressed. He be¬ gan with reviving an old law, which had enacted that no Roman citizen should possess more than 500 acres of land. The overplus he designed to distribute among those who had no lands, and to reimburse the rich out of the public treasury. This law met with great op¬ position, bred many tumults, and at last ended in the death of Gracchus and the persecution of his friends, several hundreds of whom were put to cruel deaths with¬ out any form of law",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"The disturbances did not cease with the death of Gracchus. New contests ensued on account of the Sempronian law, and the giving to the Italian allies the privilege of Roman citizens. This last not only produced great commotions in the city, but occasioned a general revolt of the states of Italy against the re¬ public of Rome. This rebellion wras not quelled with¬ out the utmost difficulty ; and in the mean time, the city was deluged with blood by the contending factions of Sylla and Marius ; the former of whom sided with the patricians, and the latter with the plebeians. These disturbances ended in the perpetual dictatorship of Syl¬ la, about 80 B. C","Roman, Rome","IT,RO,US",6,"Italy,Romania,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"From this time we may date the loss of the Roman liberty ; for though Sylla resigned his dictatorship two years after, the succeeding contests between Csesar and Pompey proved equally fatal to the republic. These contests were decided by the battle of Pbarsalia, by which Caesar became in effect master of the empire in 43 B. C. Without loss of time he then crossed over into Africa totally defeated the republican army in that continent; and, by reducing the country of Mau¬ ritania to a Roman province, completed the Roman conquests in these parts. His victory over the sons of Pompey at Munda 40 B. C. secured him from any fur¬ ther apprehensions of a rival. Being therefore sole ma¬ ster of the Roman empire, and having all the power of it at his command, he projected the greatest schemes j tending, according to some, not less to the happiness than to the glory of his country : when he was assassi¬ nated in the senate-house, in the 56th year of his age, and 39 B.

"The destruction of the Roman commonwealth pro¬ ved advantageous to the few nations of the world who still retained their liberty. That outrageous desire of conquest which had so long marked the Roman cha¬ racter, now in a great measure ceased ; because there was now another way of satisfying the desires of ambi¬ tious men, namely, by courting the favour of the em¬ peror. After the final reduction of the Spaniards, therefore, and the conquest of the countries of Msesia, Pannonia, and some others adjacent to the Roman ter¬ ritories, and which in a manner seemed naturally to be¬ long to them, the empire enjoyed for some time a pro¬ found peace","Roman, Roman, Roman",RO,6,Romania,Europe
"In the 98th year of the Christian era, Trajan was created emperor of Rome ; and being a man of great valour and experience in war, carried the Roman con¬ quests to their utmost extent. Having conquered the Dacians, a German nation beyond the Danube, and who had of late been very troublesome, he turned his arms eastward ; reduced all Mesopotamia, Chaldaea, Assyria ; and having taken Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian empire, appointed them a king, which he thought would be a proper method of keeping that war¬ like people in subjection. After this he proposed to return to Italy, but died by the way j and with his reign the seventh general period above mentioned is concluded. ^ 8. The beginning of the eighth period presents us Eighth pe- with a view of one vast empire, in which almost all theriod. Re¬ nations of the world were swallowed up.

"The Parthians having recovered their liberty, conti¬ nued to be very formidable enemies, and the barbarians of the northern parts of Europe continued to increase in strength j while the Romans, weakened by intestine divisions, became daily less able to resist them. At dilFerent times, however, some warlike emperors arose, who put a stop to the incursions of these barbarians j and about the year 215, the Parthian empire was totally overthrown by the Persians, who had long been subject to them. This revolution proved of little advantage to the Romans. The Persians were enemies still more troublesome than the Parthians had been ; and though often defeated, they still continued to infest the empire on the east, as the barbarous nations of Europe did on the north. In 260, the defeat and captivity of the emperor Valerian by the Persians, with the disturbances which followed, threatened the empire with utter destruction. Thirty tyrants seized the government at once, and the barbarians pouring in on all sides in prodigious numbers ravaged almost all the provinces of the empire. By the vigorous conduct of Claudius, Aurelian, Tacitus, Probus, and Carus, the empire was restored to its former lustre } but as the barbarians were only repulsed, and never thoroughly subdued, this proved only a temporary relief. What was worse, the Roman soldiers, growing impatient of restraint, commonly murdered those emperors who attempted to revive among them the ancient military discipline, which alone could ensure them victory over their enemies. Under Dioclesian, the disorders were so great, that though the government was held by two persons, they found themselves unable to bear the weight of it, and therefore took other two partners in the empire",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"Thus was the Roman empire divided into four parts 3 which by all historians is said to have been productive of the greatest mischiefs. As each of these four sovereigns would have as many officers both civil and military, and the same number of forces that had been maintained by the state when governed only by one emperor, the people were not able to pay the sums necessary for supporting them. Hence the taxes and imposts were increased beyond measure, the inhabitants in several provinces reduced to beggary, the laud left untilled for want of hands, &c. An end was put to these evils when the empire was again united under Constantine the Great j but in 330 a mortal blow was given it, by removing the imperial seat to Byzantium, now Constantinople, and making it equal to Rome","Roman, Constantine, Rome","RO,DZ,US",6,"Romania,Algeria,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"9. The ninth general period shows us the decline andfj;nt^' miserable end of the western part of the Roman empire, riod. R We see that mighty empire, which formerly occupiedstmction almost the whole world, now weakened by division,oft*le and surrounded by enemies. On the east, the Persians jweslern on the north, the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, and a multitude of other barbarous nations, watched all occa¬ sions to break into it 3 and miscarried in their attempts, rather through their own barbarity, than the strength of their enemies. The devastations committed by those barbarians when they made their incursions are incre¬ dible, and the relation shocking to human nature. Some authors seem much inclined to favour them} and even insinuate, that barbarity and ignorant ferocity were their chief if not their only faults: but from their history it plainly appears, that not only barbarity and the most shocking cruelty, but the highest degree of avarice, perfidy, and disregard to the most solemn promises, were to be numbered among their vices. It was ever a sufficient reason for them to make an attack, that they thought their enemies could not resist them. Their only reason for making peace, or for keeping it, was because their enemies were too strong : and their only reason for committing the most horrid massacres, rapes, and all manner of crimes, was because they had gained a victory. The Romans, degenerate as they were, are yet to be esteemed much better than these savages} and therefore we find not a single province of the empire that would submit to the barbarians while the Romans could possibly defend them",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"Some of the Roman emperors indeed withstood this inundation of savages ; but as the latter grew daily more numerous, and the Romans continued to weaken themselves by their intestine divisions, they were at last obliged to take large bodies of barbarians into their pay, and teach them their military discipline, in order to drive away their countrymen, or others who invaded the empire. This at last proved its total de¬ struction } for, in 476, the barbarians who served in the Roman armies, and were dignified with the title of allies, demanded the third part of the lands of Italy as a reward for their services : but meeting with a re¬ fusal, they revolted, and made themselves masters of the whole country, and of Rome itself, which from that time ceased to be the head of an empire of any consequence","Roman, Roman, Rome","RO,IT,US",6,"Romania,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"This period exhibits a most unfavourable view ofGenetaf the western parts of the world : The Romans, from the height of grandeur, sunk to the lowest slavery, nay, in all probability, almost exterminated } the pro¬ vinces they formerly governed, inhabited by human beings scarce a degree above the brutes} every art and science lost} and the savage conquerors even in danger of starving for want of a sufficient knowledge of agriculture, having now no means of supplying themselves by plunder and robbery as before. Britain had long been abandoned to the mercy of the Scots and Piets } and in 450 the inhabitants had called in the Saxons to their assistance, whom they soon found worse enemies than those against whom they had im¬ plored ril H nry- StL ' HIST plored their aid. Spain was held by the Goths and Suevians ; Africa (that is Barbary and Bildulgerld) 1 by the Vandals; the Burgundians, Goths, Franks, and Alans, had erected several small states in Gaul ; and Italy was subjected to the Herull under Odoacer, who had taken upon him the title of king of Italy. In the east, indeed, matters wore an aspect somewhat more agreeable. The Roman empire continued to live in that of Constantinople, which was still very extensive",,"IT,ES",6,"Italy,Spain","Europe,Europe"
"It comprehended all Asia Minor and Syria, as far as Persia ; in Africa, the kingdom of Egypt; and Greece in Europe.

"Among the western nations, revolutions, as might naturally be expected from the character of the people, succeeded one another with rapidity. The Heruli un¬ der Odoacer were driven out by the Goths under Theodoric. The Goths were expelled by the Romans; and, while the two parties were contending, both were attacked by the Franks, who carried off an immense booty. The Romans were in their turn expelled by the Goths : the Franks again invaded Italy, and made themselves masters of the province of Venetia ; but at last the superior fortune of the emperor of Constantino¬ ple prevailed, and the Goths were finally subdued in 553. Narses, the conqueror of the Goths, governed Italy as a province of the eastern empire till the year 568, when Longinus his successor made considerable alterations. The Italian provinces had ever since the time of Constantine the Great been governed by consu- lares, correctores, and presides ; no alteration having been made either by the Roman emperors, or the Go¬ thic kings. But Longinus, being invested with abso¬ lute power by Justinian, suppressed those magistrates ; and, instead of them, placed in each city of note a go¬ vernor, whom he distinguished with the title of duke","Constantine, Roman","IT,DZ,RO",6,"Italy,Algeria,Romania","Europe,Africa,Europe"
"The city of Rome was not more honoured than any other; for Longinus, having abolished the very name ol senate and consuls, appointed a duke of Rome as well as of other cities.

"Another kingdom had been founded in the western parts of Spain by the Suevi, a considerable time before the Romans were finally expelled from that country",,ES,6,Spain,Europe
"In 409, this kingdom was entirely subverted by Theo¬ doric king of the Goths ; and the Suevi were so pent up in a small district of Lusitania and Galicia, that it seemed impossible for them to recover themselves. Du¬ ring the above-mentioned period, however, while the attention of the Goths was turned another way, they had found means again to erect themselves into an in¬ dependent state, and to become masters of considerably extended territories. But this success proved of short duration. In 584, the Goths attacked them ; totally destroyed their empire a second time ; and thus became masters of all Spain, except some small part which still owned subjection to the emperors of Constantinople",,ES,6,Spain,Europe

"and many of the Archipelago islands 5 nor were the coasts of Italy itself free from their incursions ; nay, they are even said to have reached the distant and bar¬ ren country of Iceland. At last this great empire, as well as others, began to decline. Its ruin was very sudden, and owing to its internal divisions. Mahomet had not taken care to establish the apostleship in his family, or to give any particular directions about a successor. 'I he consequence of this was, that the ca¬ liphate, or succession to the apostleship, was seized by many usurpers in different parts of the empire j while the true caliphs, who resided at Bagdad, gradually lost all power, and were regarded only as a kind of high- priests. Of these divisions the Turks took advantage to establish their authority in many provinces of the Mohammedan empire; but as they embraced the same religion with the Arabs, and were filled with the same enthusiastic desire of conquest, it is ol little consequence to distinguish between them ; as indeed it signified little to the world in general whether the Turks or Saracens were the conquerors, since both were cruel, barbarous, ignorant, and superstitious",Of,"IT,IS,TR",6,"Italy,Iceland,Turkey","Europe,Europe,Asia"
""" While the barbarians of the east were thus grasping at the empire of the whole world, great disturbances happened among the no less barbarous nations of the west. Superstition seems to have been the ruling mo¬ tive in both cases. The Saracens and Turks conquer¬ ed for the glory of God, or of his apostle Mahomet and his successors j the western nations professed an equal regard for the divine glory, but which was only to be perceived in the respect they paid to the pope and clergy. Ever since the establishment of Christi¬ anity by Constantine, the bishops of Rome had been gradually extending their power j and attempting not only to render themselves independent, hut even to as¬ sume an authority over the emperors themselves. The destruction of the empire was so far from weakening their power, that it afforded them opportunities of greatly extending it, and becoming judges of the sovereigns of Italy themselves, whose barbarity and ignorance prompted them to submit to their decisions. All this time, however, they themselves had been in subjec¬ tion to the emperors of Constantinople j but on the decline of that empire, they found means to get themselves exempted from this subjection. The prin¬ cipal authority in the city of Rome was then engross¬ ed by the bishop j though of right it belonged to the duke appointed by the exarch of Ravenna. But though they had now little to fear from the eastern empe¬ rors, they were in great danger from the ambition of the Lombards, who aimed at the conquest of all Italy","Constantine, Rome, Rome, Ravenna","IT,US,DZ",6,"Italy,United States,Algeria","Europe,North America,Africa"
"This aspiring people the bishops of Rome determined to check j and therefore, in 726, when Luitprand king of the Lombards had taken Ravenna and expel¬ led the exarch, the pope undertook to restore him",Ravenna,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"Some time before, a quarrel had happened between Civil History O R Y. Sect. ] the pope (Gregory II.) and Leo emperor of the east, about the worship of images. Leo, who it seems, in the midst of so much barbarism, bad still preserved ’ some share of common sense and reason, reprobated the worship of images in the strongest terms, and com¬ manded them to be destroyed throughout his domi¬ nions. The pope, whose cause was favoured by the most absurd superstitions, and by these only, refused to obey the emperor’s commands. The exarch of Ravenna, as a subject of the emperor, was ordered to force the pope to a compliance, and even to seize or as¬ sassinate him in case of a refusal. ’I his excited the pious zeal of Luitprand to assist the pope, whom he had formerly designed to subdue: the exarch w7as first excommunicated, and then torn in pieces by the enra¬ ged multitude: the duke of Naples shared the same fate; and a vast number of the Iconoclasts, or Image- breakers, as they were called, were slaughtered with¬ out mercy: and to complete all, the subjects of the exarchate, at the instigation of the Pope, renounced their allegiance to the emperor","Ravenna, Naples","IT,US",6,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"Leo was no sooner informed of this revolt than he ordered a powerful army to be raised, in order to re¬ duce the rebels, and take vengeance on the Pope. A- larmed at these warlike preparations, Gregory looked round for some power on which he might depend for protection. The Lombards were possessed of suffi¬ cient force, hut they were too near and too danger¬ ous neighbours to be trusted) the Venetians, though zealous Catholics, were as yet unable to withstand the force of the empire ) Spain was overrun by the Sa¬ racens : the French seemed, therefore, the only peo¬ ple to whom it was advisable to apply for aid) as they were able to oppose the emperor, and were likewise enemies to his edict. Charles Martel, who at that time governed France as mayor of the palace, was therefore applied to; hut before a treaty could be concluded, all the parties concerned were removed by, death. Constantine Copronymus, who succeeded Leo at Constantinople, not only persisted in the opposition to image-worship begun by his predecessor, but pro¬ hibited also the invocation of saints. Zachary, who succeeded Gregory III. in the pontificate, proved as zealous an adversary as his predecessor. Pepin, who succeeded Charles Martel in the sovereignty of France, proved as powerful a friend to the pope as his father had been. The people of Rome had nothing to fear from Constantinople; and therefore drove out all the emperor’s officers. The Lombards, awed by the power of France, for some time allowed the pope to govern in peace the dominions of the exarchate; hot in 752, Astolphus king of Lombardy not only re¬ duced the greatest part of the pope’s territories, but threatened the city of Rome itself. Upon this an ap¬ plication was made to Pepin, who obliged Astolphus to restore the places he had taken, and gave them to the pope, or, as he said, to St Peter. Ihe Greek emperor to whom they of right belonged, remonstra¬ ted to no purpose. The pope from that time became possessed of considerable territories in Italy ; which, from the manner of their donation, go under the name of St Peter's Patrimony. It was not, however, before the year 774, that the pope was fully secured in these new dominions.

"Thus was the world once more divided into three °f the great empires. The empire of the Arabs or Saracens extended from the river Ganges to Spain ; compre¬ hending almost all of Asia and Africa which has ever been known to Europeans, the kingdoms of China and Japan excepted. The eastern Roman empire was re¬ duced to Greece, Asia Minor, and the provinces ad¬ joining to Italy. The empire of the west, under Char¬ lemagne, comprehended France, Germany, and the greatest part ot Italy. The Saxons, however, as yet possessed Britain unmolested by external enemies, though the seven kingtjoms erected by them were engaged in perpetual contests. The Venetians also enjoyed a nominal liberty, tliough it is probable that their situ¬ ation would render them very much dependent on the great powers which surrounded them. Of all nations on earth, the Scots and Piets, and the remote ones of China and Japan seem to have enjoyed, from their si¬ tuation, the greatest share of liberty $ unless, perhaps, we except the Scandinavians, who, under the names of Dunes and Normans, were soon to infest their south¬ ern neighbours. But of all the European potentates, the popes certainly exercised the greatest authority j since even Charlemagne himself submitted to accept the crown from their hands, and his successors made them the arbiters of their differences","Asia, Roman, Of","CN,JP,IT,ES,GR,FR,DE,PH,RO,TR",6,"China,Japan,Italy,Spain,Greece,France,Germany,Philippines,Romania,Turkey","Asia,Asia,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia,Europe,Asia"
"Endless disputes and wars ensued among them, till at last the sovereign power was seized by Hugh Capet in 987. The Saxon heptarchy was dissolved in 827, and the whole kingdom of England reduced under one head. The Hanes and Normans began to make de¬ predations, and infest the neighbouring states. Tlie former conquered the English Saxons, and seized the government, but were in their turn expelled by the Normans in 1066. In Germany and Italy the greatest disturbances arose from the contests between the popes and the emperors. To all this if we add the internal contests which happened through the ambition of the powerful barons of every kingdom, we can scarce form an idea of times more calamitous than those of which we now treat. All Europe, nay, all the world, was one great held of battle; for the empire of the Maho¬ metans was not in a more settled state than that of the Europeans. Caliphs, sultans, emirs, &c. waged con¬ tinual war with each other in every quarter ; new so¬ vereignties every day sprung up, and were as quickly destroyed. In short, through the ignorance and barba¬ rity with which the whole world was overspread, it seemed in a manner impossible that the human race could long continue to exist ; wiien happily the crusades, oy directing the attention of the Europeans to one pnrticular object, made them in some measure suspend their slaughters of one another",,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"xh which they called the Ho/y Land, to be an invaluable acquisition, for which no sum of money could be an equivalent ; and both took the most unjustifiable me¬ thods to accomplish their desires. The superstition of Omar the second caliph had prompted him to invade this country, part of the territories of the Greek empe¬ ror, who was doing him no hurt; and now when it had been so long under the subjection of the Mahometans, a similar superstition prompted the pope to send an army for the recovery of it. The crusaders accordingly poured forth in multitudes, like those with which the kings of Persia formerly invaded Greece ; and their fate w'as pretty similar. Their impetuous valour at first, indeed, carried every thing before them ; they reco¬ vered all Palestine, Phoenicia, and part of Syria, from the infidels ; but their want of conduct soon lost what their valour had obtained, and very few of that vast multitude which had left Europe ever returned to their native countries. A second, a third, and several other crusades, were preached, and were attended with a like success in both respects : vast numbers took the cross, and repaired to the Holy Land ; which they polluted with the most abominable massacres and treacheries, and from which very few of them returned. In the third crusade Richard I. of England was embarked, who seems to have been the best general that ever went into the east: but even his valour and skill were not sufficient to repair the faults of his companions; and he was obliged to return even after he had entirely de¬ feated his antagonists, and was within sight of Jeru¬ salem","Ho, Palestine","GR,SY,GH,US",6,"Greece,Syrian Arab Republic,Ghana,United States","Europe,Asia,Africa,North America"

All these princes, however, owned allegiance to the family of Jenghiz Khan till the time of Timur Bek, or Tamerlane. The Turks, in the mean time, urged forward by the inundation of Tartars who poured in from the east, were forced up¬ on the remains of the Greek empire ; and at the time of Tamerlane above mentioned, they had almost con¬ fined this once mighty empire within the walls of Con¬ stantinople",,GR,6,Greece,Europe

"To enrich themselves either by the gold and silver produced in these countries, or by traffic with the natives, now became the object. The Portuguese had the advantage of being the first discoverers of the east¬ ern, and the Spaniards of the western countries. The former did not neglect so favourable an opportunity of enriching themselves by commerce. Many settlements were formed by them in the East India islands, and on the continent *, but their avarice and perfidious beha¬ viour towards the natives proved at last the cause of their total expulsion. The Spaniards enriched them¬ selves by the vast quantities of the precious metals im¬ ported from America, which were not obtained but by the most horrid massacres committed on the natives, and of which an account is given under the different names of the American countries. These possessions of the Spaniards and Portuguese soon excited other Euro¬ pean nations to make attempts to share with them in their treasures, by planting colonies in different parts of America, and making settlements in the East Indies : and thus has the rage of war in some measure been transferred from Europe to these distant regions; and, after various contests, the British at last obtained a great superiority both in America and the East Indies",,"US,PT,GB",6,"United States,Portugal,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"

"This superstition indeed seems to be natural to man, especially when placed in such a situation that he hath little opportunity of instruction, or of improving bis0 rational faculties. This seems also probable from ail}o|alr).s caution given to the Jews, lest, when they looked up to the sun, moon, and stars, and the rest of the host ot heaven, they should be driven to worship them. The origin of idolatry among the Syrians and Arabians, and also in Greece, is therefore accounted for with great probability in the following manner by the au¬ thor of the Ruins of Balbeck. “ In those uncomfort¬ able deserts, where the day presents nothing to the view but the uniform, tedious, and melancholy prospect of barren sands, the night discloses a most delightful and magnificent spectacle, and appears arrayed with charms of the most attractive kind. For the most part unclouded and serene, it exhibits to the wonder¬ ing eye the host of heaven in all their variety and glory! In the view of this stupendous scene, the tran¬ sition from admiration to idolatry was too easy to unin- structed minds; and a people whose climate offered no beauties to contemplate hut those of the firmament, would naturally look thither for the objects of their worship. The form of idolatry in Greece was different from that of the. Syrians ; which perhaps may be at¬ tributed to that smiling and variegated scene of moun¬ tains, valleys, rivers, woods, groves, and fountains, which the transported imagination, in the midst of its pleasing astonishment, supposed to be the seats of invi¬ sible deities.” A difficulty, however, arises on this supposition ; for if idolatry is naturally produced in the mind of unin¬ structed and savage man from a view of the creation, why hath not idolatry of some kind or other taken place among all the different nations of the world ? This certainly hath not been the case ; of which the most striking examples are the Persians of old, and the Moguls in more modern times. Both these nations were strict deists ; so that w'e must allow some other causes to concur in producing idolatry besides these already mentioned ; and of these causes an imperfect and obscure notion of the true religion seems to be the most probable. ‘ ^ Though idolatry, therefore, was formerly very pre- General ■ valent, it neither extended over the whole earth, nor account (■ were the superstitions of the idolaters all of one kind, die Hea- Every nation had its respective gods, over which onetlien ^Ui,, more excellent than the rest was said to preside ; yet in such a manner, that this supreme deity himself w'as controuled by the rigid empire of the fates, or by what philosophers called eternal necessity. The gods of the east were different from those of the Gauls, the Ger¬ mans, and the other northern nations. The Grecian divinities differed widely from those of the Egyptians, who deified plants, animals, and a great variety of the productions both of nature and art. Each people also had their own particular manner of worshipping and ap¬ peasing their respective deities, entirely different from the sacred rites of other countries. All this variety of religions, however, produced neither wars nor dissen¬ sions among the different nations ; each nation suffered its neighbours to follow their own method of worship, without discovering any displeasure on that account",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"Two religions at this time flourished in Palestine, viz, the Jewish and Samaritan *, between whose re¬ spective followers reigned thp most violent hatred or contempt. The difference between them seems to have been chiefly about the place of worship $ which the Jews would have to lie in Jerusalem, and the Sa¬ maritans on Mount Gerizzim. But though the Jews were certainly right as to this point, they had greatly corrupted their religion in other respects. They ex¬ pected a Saviour indeed, hut they mistook his charac¬ ter ; imagining that he was to be a powerful and war¬ like prince, who should set them free from the Roman yoke, which they bore with the utmost impatience","Palestine, Jerusalem, Roman","US,IL,RO",6,"United States,Israel,Romania","North America,Asia,Europe"
"The Heathens, however, though at first they showed no very violent spirit of persecution against the Chri¬ stians, soon came to hate them as much as the Jews themselves. Tacitus acquaints us with the causes of this hatred, when speaking of the first general persecu¬ tion under Nero. That inhuman emperor having, as was supposed, set fire to the city of Borne, to avoid the imputation of this wickedness, transferred it on the 54 Christians. Our author informs us that they were al-Tacitus’s ready abhorred on account of their many and enormous acco.unt crimes. “ The author of this name (Christians')S'1 says1*16 il,st.• ne was Christ, who, m the reign 01 liberals, was[,y \jer0i executed under Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judaia",Borne,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"HISTORY. Sect. 1 i :« ami mentions no other crime of which they were guil¬ ty.

"Concerning the ceremonies and method of worship used by the Christians of the first century, it is impos¬ sible to say any thing with certainty. Neither is the church order, government, and discipline, during this period, ascertained with any degree of exactness. Each of those parties, therefore, which exist at this day, contends with the greatest earnestness for that particu¬ lar mode of worship which they themselves have adopt¬ ed ; and some of the most bigotted would willingly monopolize the word chvrch in such a manner as to ex¬ clude from all hope of salvation every one who is not attached to their particular party. It doth not how¬ ever appear that, excepting baptism, the Lord’s sup¬ per, and anointing the sick with oil, any external ce¬ remonies or symbols were properly of divine appoint¬ ment. According to Dr Mosheim, “ there are seve¬ ral circumstances which incline us to think, that the friends and apostles of our blessed Lord either tolerated through necessity, or appointed for tvise reasons, many other external rites in various places. At the same tune, we are not to imagine, that they ever conferred upon any person a perpetual, indelible, pontifical au¬ thority, or that they enjoined the same rites in all churches. We learn, on the contrary, from authentic lecord?, that the Christian worship was from the be¬ ginning celebrated in a different manner in different places ; and that, no doubt, by the orders, or at least with the approbation, of the apostles and their disci¬ ples. In those early times, it was both wise and ne¬ cessary to show, in the establishment of outward forms of worship, some indulgence to the ancient opinions, 3 manners, and laws, of the respective nations to whom EccIcmi the gospel was preached.” iticd The second century commences with the third year ^Utorf p of the emperor Trajan.

"In the mean time, the bounds of the church were en¬ larged ; the custom of holding councils was followed wherever the sound of the gospel had reached ; and the universal church had now the appearance of one vast republic formed by a combination of a great number ot little states. This occasioned the creation of a new order of ecclesiastics, who were appointed in different parts of the world as heads of the church, and whose office it was to preserve the consistence and union of that immense body, whose members were so widely dispersed throughout the nations. Such was the na¬ ture and office of the Patriarchs; among whom, at length, ambition, being arrived at its most insolent period, formed a new dignity, investing the bishop of Borne with the title and authority of the Prince of the Patriarchs",Borne,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe

"The imprudence of the emperor, and precipitation of the bishops, were remarkably discovered in the follow¬ ing event, which favoured extremely the ambition of the Roman pontiff.

"The bishops assembled in council at Rome io 378, not considering the fatal consequences that must arise from this imprudent law both to themselves and to the church, declared their approbation in the strongest terms, and recommended the execution of it in their address to the emperor Gratian. Some think, indeed, that this law empowered the Roman bishop to judge only the bishops within the limits of his jurisdiction ; others, that his power was given only for a certain time, and for a particular purpose. This last notion seems the most probable j but still this privilege must have been an excellent instrument in the hands of sa¬ cerdotal ambition. g-g By the removal of the seat of empire to Constanti-Bishops of nople, the emperor raised up, in the bishop of this ^'ome an.d new metropolis, a formidable opponent to the bishope^^ai of Rome, and a bulwark which threatened a vigorous ea£h opposition to his growing authority.

"HIST world so Its bishop, measuring his own dignity and rank by the magnificence of the new city, and its eminence as the residence of the emperor, assumed an equal degree of dignity with the bishop of Home, and claimed a superiority over the rest of the episcopa or¬ der. Nor did the emperors disapprove of these higli pretensions, since they considered their own dignity as connected in a certain measure with that of the bis.iop of their imperial city. Accordingly, in a council held at Constantinople in the year 381, by the authority of Theodosius the Great, the bishop of that city was, durin""-the absence of the bishop of Alexandria, and against the consent of the Homan prelate, placed >y the third canon of that council in the first ran^t alter the bishop of Home, and consequently above those of Alexandria and Antioch. Nectanus was the first bi¬ shop who enjoyed these new honours accumulated up¬ on the see of Constantinople. His successor, the cele¬ brated John Chrysostom, extended still farther the privileges of that see, and submitted to its jurisdiction all Thrace, Asia, and Pontus; nor were the succeed¬ ing bishops of that imperial city destitute of a fervent zeal to augment their privileges and extend their do¬ minion. By this unexpected promotion, the most dis¬ agreeable effects were produced. '1 be bishops of Alex¬ andria were not only filled with the most inveterate ha¬ tred against those of Constantinople, but contention was excited between the bishops of Rome and Constantino¬ ple *, which, after being carried on for many ages, con¬ cluded at last in the separation of the Greek and La¬ tin churches","Alexandria, Alexandria, Antioch, Asia, Rome","US,PH,GR",6,"United States,Philippines,Greece","North America,Asia,Europe"
"Constantine the Great, in order to prevent civil com- • motions, and to fix his authority on a stable and solid foundation, made several changes not only in the laws of the empire, but also in the form of the Roman go¬ vernment. And as there were many important reasons which induced him to suit the administration of the church to these changes in the civil constitution,' this necessarily introduced among the bishops new degrees of eminence and rank. The four bishops, of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, were distin¬ guished by a certain degree of pre-eminence over the rest. These four prelates answered to the four prae¬ torian prefects created by Constantine *, and it is pos¬ sible, that even in this century they were distinguished by the Jewish title of patriarchs. After these followed the exarchs, who had the inspection of several pro¬ vinces, and answered to the appointment of certain ci¬ vil officers who bore the same title. In a lower class were the metropolitans, who had only the government of one province j under whom were the archbishops, whose inspection was confined to certain districts. In this gradation the bishops brought up the rear ; but the sphere of their authority was not in all places equally extensive ; being in some considerably ample, and in others confined within narrow limits. To these va¬ rious ecclesiastical orders we might add that of the chorepiscopi, or superintendents of the country churches j but this last order was in most places suppressed by the bishops, with a design to extend their own autho¬ rity, and enlarge the sphere of their power and juris¬ diction.

"The annals of the French nation furnish us with the temporal following instance of the enormous power which was nnee' at this time vested in the Roman pontiff.

"For this purpose he assembled the states in 751 ; and though they were devoted to the interests of this am¬ bitious usurper, they gave it as their opinion that the bishop of Rome was previously to be consulted whether the execution of such a scheme was lawful or not. In consequence of this, ambassadors were sent by Pepin to Zachary, the reigning pontiff, with the follow¬ ing question, “ Whether the divine law dkl not per¬ mit a valiant and warlike people to dethrone a pu¬ sillanimous and indolent pHnce who was incapable of discharging any of the functions of royalty j and to 73 He becomes substitute in his place one more worthy to rule, and Ecclesia- who had already rendered most important services to stical the state ?” The situation of Zachary, who stood much , Hl5t0fy- in need of the succours of Pepin against the Greeks * ^ and Lombards, rendered bis answer such as the usurper desired : and when this favourable decision of the Ro¬ man oracle was published in France, the unhappy Childeric was stripped of his royalty without the least opposition •, and Pepin, without the smallest resistance, stepped into the throne of his master and his sove¬ reign. This decision was solemnly confirmed by Ste¬ phen II. the successor of Zachary $ who undertook a journey into France in the year 754, in order to so¬ licit assistance against the Lombards. The pontiff at the same time dissolved the obligation of the oath of fidelity and allegiance which Pepin had sworn to Chil¬ deric, and violated by his usurpation in the year 751 } and to render his title to the crown as sacred as pos¬ sible, Stephen anointed and crowned him, with his wife and two sons, for the second time. This complaisance of the pope was rewarded with the exarchate of Ra¬ venna and all its dependencies, as we have already re¬ lated.

The increase of their authority in reli¬ gious matters was not less rapid. The wisest and most impartial among the Roman Catholic writers acknow¬ ledge, that from the time of Louis the Meek the an¬ cient rules of ecclesiastical government were gradually changed in Europe by the counsels and instigation of the church of Rome, and new laws substituted in their place. The European princes suffered themselves to bo divested of the supreme authority in religious matters, which they had derived from Charlemagne $ the power of the bishops was greatly diminished, and even the authority of both provincial and general councils began to decline. The popes, elated with their overgrown prosperity, and become arrogant beyond measure by the daily accessions that were made to their authority, were eagerly bent upon establishing the maxim, That the bishop of Rome was constituted and appointed by Jesus Christ supreme legislator and judge of the church universal $ and that therefore the bishops derived all their authority from him. This opinion, which they inculcated with the utmost zeal and ardour, was oppo¬ sed in vain by such as wei*e acquainted with the ancient ecclesiastical constitutions, and the government of the church in the earlier ages. In order to gain credit to this new ecclesiastical code, and to support the preten¬ sions of the popes to supremacy, it was necessary to pro¬ duce the authority of ancient deeds, in order to stop the mouths of such as were disposed to set bounds to their usurpations. The bishops of Rome were aware of this j and as those means were looked upon as the most law¬ ful that tended best to the accomplishment of their purposes, they employed some of their most ingenious and zealous partisans in forging conventions, acts of councils, epistles, and such like records, by which it might appear, that in the first ages of the church the Roman","Rome, Roman, Rome, Rome, Rome, Roman","US,FR,IT,RO",6,"United States,France,Italy,Romania","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"

"But the generality of writers in his kind content them¬ selves with taking their accounts from hearsays, or transcribing them from others, without duly weighing the evidence on which they are founded, or giving themselves the trouble of a strict inquiry. Few will use the diligence necessary to inform themselves of the certainty of what they undertake to relate. And as the want of this greatly abates the pleasure of reading such writers, while persons read with diffidence; so nothing more recommends an historian than such in¬ dustry. Thus we are informed of Thucydides, that when he wrote his history of the Peloponnesian war, he did not satisfy himself with the best accounts he could get from his countrymen the Athenians, fearing they might be partial in their own cause; but spared no expence to inform himself how the same facts were re¬ lated by their enemies the Lacedmmonians ; that, by comparing the relations of both parties, he might better judge of the truth. And Polybius took greater pains than he, in order to write his history of the Roman af¬ fairs ; for he travelled into Africa, Spain, and Gaul, and other parts of the world, that by viewing the se¬ veral scenes of action, and informing himself from the inhabitants, he might come at a greater certainty of the facts, and represent them in a juster light. But as an historian ought not to assert what he knows to be false ; so he should likewise be cautious in relating things which are doubtful, and acquaint his readers with the evidence he goes upon in such facts, from whence they may be able to judge how far it is proper to credit them. So Herodotus tells us what things he saw himself in his travels, and what he heard from the information of the Egyptian priests and others with whom he conversed. And Curtius, in the life of Alex¬ ander, speaking of the affairs of India, ingenuously confesses, that he wrote more than he fully believed",Roman,"ES,IN,RO,EG",6,"Spain,India,Romania,Egypt","Europe,Asia,Europe,Africa"
"Suetonius is said to have written the lives of the frst twelve Roman emperors with the same freedom where¬ with they themselves lived. What better character can be given of a writer? The same ingenuous temper appears in the two Grecian historians above men¬ tioned, Thucydides and Polybius: The former of whom, though banished by his countrymen the Athe¬ nians, yet expresses no marks of resentment in his history, either against them in general, or even against the chief authors of it, when he has occasion to men¬ tion them 5 and the latter does not forbear censuring what he thought blameable in his nearest relations and friends. But it is often no easy matter to know whether a historian speaks truth or not, and keeps up to the several characters here mentioned; though it seems reasonable, upon the common principles of justice due to all mankind, to credit him where no marks of partiality or prejudice appear in his writings",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"And lastly, where that has been their unhappy fate, how they received their final ruin and subversion. Most of these things Livy had in view when he wrote his History of the Roman State, as he acquaints his readers in the preface. “ The accounts (says he) of what hap¬ pened either before or while the city was building, con¬ sisting rather of poetical fables than any certain records of facts, I shall neither assert nor confute them. Let antiquity be allowed to make the origin of their cities more venerable, by uniting things human and divine",Most,CZ,6,Czechia,Europe
"HIST which are more general frequently contain only the af¬ fairs of some short period of time. Tims the history of the Peloponnesian war, written by Ihucydides, com- ’ prises only what was done in the lirst 20 years of that war, which lasted seven years longer than his account reaches $ though indeed the reason ol that might be, because Thucydides died before the war was finished, otherwise he would very probably have continued his history to the conclusion of it. But the history ot the war between the Romans and King Jugurtha in Afri¬ ca, given us by Sallust, as also GajsaPs histories ot the Gallic and Civil wars, are all confined within a much less number of years than that of Thucydides. Nay, sometimes one single transaction is thought sufficient to furnish out a history. Such was the conspiracy of Ca¬ tiline to subvert the Roman state, written likewise by Sallust. As to more general histories, Xenophon’s his¬ tory of Greece may be esteemed as such j which in or¬ der of time succeeds that of Thucydides, and contains the affairs of 48 years. And Polybius called his a ge¬ neral history; which, though it principally contained the Roman affairs, yet took in the most remarkable transactions of several other states, for the space of 53 years : though it has met with the same hard fate as that of Diodorus Siculus, so that only the first five books out of forty, of which it consisted at first, now re¬ main entire. And to mention no more, the celebrated history of Thuanus is another instance of this sort, in which the principal transactions of Europe for about 60 years, chiefly in the 16th century, are described with that judgment and fidelity, and in a manner so ac¬ curate and beautiful, that he has been thought scarce¬ ly inferior to any of the ancient historians. Now, in such histories as these, to go farther back than is neces¬ sary to set the subject in a just light, seems as improper as it is unnecessary","Roman, Roman","RO,GR",6,"Romania,Greece","Europe,Europe"
"si. siclers the causes of actions, and what were the designs >f and views of those persons who were principally con- y- cerned in them. Some, as Polybius has well observed, are apt to confound the beginnings of actions with their springs and causes, which ought to be carefully separated. For the causes are often very remote, and to be looked for at a considerable distance from the ac¬ tions themselves. Thus, as he tells us, some have re¬ presented Hannibal’s besieging Saguntum in Spain, and passing the Ebro, contrary to a former agreement between the Romans and Carthaginians, as causes of the second Punic war. But these were only the begin¬ nings of it. The true causes were the jealousies and fears of the Carthaginians from the growing power of the Romans ; and Hannibal’s inveterate hatred to them, with which he had been impressed from his in¬ fancy. For his father, whom he succeeded in the com¬ mand of the Carthaginian army, had obliged him, when but nine years old, to take a most solemn oath upon an altar never to be reconciled to the Romans : and therefore he was no sooner at the head of the army, than he took the first opportunity to break with them","Hannibal, Hannibal","US,ES",6,"United States,Spain","North America,Europe"
"That was left for his son. But as King Philip could not have done this without first bringing the other states of Greece into it, his pretence to them was only to avenge the injuries they had all suffered from the lei- sians j though the real design was an universal govern¬ ment, both over them and the Persians, as appeared af¬ terwards by the event. But in order to our being well assured of a person’s real designs, and to make the ac¬ counts of them more credible, it is proper we should be acquainted with his disposition, manners, way ot life, virtues, or vices j that by comparing his actions with these, we may see how far they agree and suit each other. For this reason Sallust is so particular in his description of Catiline, and Livy of Hannibal ; by which it appears credible, that the one was capable of entering into such a conspiracy against his country, and the other of performing such great things as are re¬ lated concerning him. But if the causes of actions lie in the dark, and unknown, a prudent historian will not trouble himself or his readers with vain and trifling conjectures, unless something very probable oilers it¬ self",Hannibal,"GR,US",6,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"c. S-l HIST observation that Livy makes upon the ill-conduct of Hannibal in quartering his army in Capua after the battle of Cannae $ by which means they lost their mar¬ tial vigour through luxury and ease. “ Those (says he) who are skilled in military affairs reckoned this a greater fault in the general, than his not marching his army immediately to Rome after his victory at Cannae j for such a delay might have seemed only to defer the victory, but this ill step deprived him of the power to gain it.” The modesty of the historian in this passage is worth remarking, in that he does not represent this as his own private opinion, and by that means under¬ take to censure the conduct of so great a general as Hannibal was, but as the sense of those who were skill¬ ed in such affairs. However, a historian should be brief in such remarks j and consider, that although he does not exceed his province by applauding virtue, ex¬ pressing a just indignation against vice, and interposing his judgment upon the nature and consequences of the facts he relates 5 yet there ought to be a difference be¬ tween his reflections and the encomiums or declamations of an orator","Hannibal, Capua, Rome, Hannibal","US,IT",6,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"III. Speeches inserted by historians. These are of two sorts, oblique and direct. The former are such as the historian recites in his own person, and not in that of the speaker. Of this kind is that of Hannibal in Justin $ by which he endeavours to persuade King Antiochus to carry the seat of the war against the Ro¬ mans into Italy. It runs thus : “ Having desired jjli- bevty to speak, he said none of the present counsels and designs pleased him j nor did he approve of Greece for the seat of the war, which might be managed in Italy to greater advantage : because it was impossible to conquer the Romans but by their own arms, or to subdue Italy but by its own forces; since both the nature of those men, and of that war, was different from all others. In other wars, it was of great importance to gain an advantage of place or time, to ravage the coun¬ tries and plunder the towns; but though you gain some advantage over the Romans, or defeat them, you must still fight with them when beaten. Wherefore, should any one engage with them in Italy, it was possible for him to conquer them by their own power, strength, and arms, as he himself had done ; but should he attempt it out of Italy, the source of their power, he would be as much deceived, as if he endeavoured to alter the course of a river, not at the fountain-head, but where its streams were largest and deepest. This was his judgment in private, and what he had offered as his advice, and now repeated in the presence of his friends; that all might know in what manner a war ought to be carried on against the Romans, who were invincible abroad, but might be conquered at home. For they might sooner be driven out of their city than their em¬ pire, and from Italy than their provinces ; having been taken by the Gauls, and almost subdued by himself","Of, Hannibal","IT,GR,TR,US",6,"Italy,Greece,Turkey,United States","Europe,Europe,Asia,North America"
"The reason offered against direct speeches is, because they are not true; and truth is the foundation of all history, from which it never ought to depart. Such speeches, therefore, are said to weaken the credit of the writer ; since he who will tell us that another person spoke such things which he does not know that he ever did speak, and in such language as lie could not use, may take the same liberty in represent¬ ing his actions. Thus, for example, when Livy gives us the speeches of Romulus, the Sabine women, Bru¬ tus, and others, in the first ages of the Roman state, both the things themselves are imaginary, and the language wholly disagreeable to the times in which those persons lived. Accordingly we find, that when several historians relate some particular speech of the same person, they widely differ both in the subject- matter and expressions. So the speech of Veturia, by which she dissuaded her son Coriolanus from be¬ sieging Rome when he came against it with an army !m- ir ed III.

"Int, 1 «• And if any direct speeches are to be inserted, they b- vl should be such only as were really spoken by the per- n^Co 1. 8ons w^om they are ascribed, where any such have m, been preserved. These have been the sentiments of ce ""V !. some critics both ancient and modern. However, irsj t. (|iere ;s scarce an ancient historian now extant, either ""c‘ Greek or Latin, who has not some speeches, more or less, in his works ; and those not only oblique, but also direct. They seem to have thought it a necessary or¬ nament to their writings : and even where the true speeches might be come at, have chosen rather to give them in their own words j in order, probably, to pre¬ serve an equality in the style. Since therefore the best and most faithful historians have generally taken this liberty, we are to distinguish between their accounts of facts and their speeches. In the former, where nothing appears to the contrary, we are to suppose they adhere to truth, according to the best information they could get; but in the latter, that their view is only to ac¬ quaint us with the causes and springs of actions, which they choose to do in the form of speeches, as a method most ornamental to the work, and entertaining to the reader: Though the best historians are cautious of in¬ serting speeches, but where they are very proper, and upon some solemn and weighty occasions. Thufcydides is said to have been the first who brought complete and finished speeches into history, those of Herodotus be¬ ing but short and imperfect. And though Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his censure epon Thucydides, seems then to have disliked that part of his conduct ; yet he afterwards thought fit to imitate it in his Antiquities of Home, where we find many not only oblique, but also 1 direct speeches",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"“ Whether (says he) it may answer any valuable end for me to write the history of the Roman affairs from the beginning of the city, I neither am certain, nor if I was should I venture to declare it.” Soon after he endeavours to prepare the reader’s attention, by repre¬ senting the grandeur and usefulness of the subject in the following words: “ Either I am prejudiced in fa¬ vour of my subject, or there never was any state great¬ er, more virtuous, and fruitful of good examples, or in which avarice and luxury had a later admittance, or po¬ verty and thriftiness were either more highly or longer esteemed, they always coveting less the less they en¬ joyed.” And then he presently proceeds to ingratiate himself with his readers, and gain their favourable opi¬ nion : “ Although my name is obscure in so great a number of writers, yet it is a comfort that they cloud it by their fame and character. But I shall gain this advantage by my labour, that I shall be diverted for a time from the prospect of those evils which the age has seen for so many years ; while my mind is wholly intent upon former times, free from all that care which gives the writer an uneasiness, though it cannot bias him against the truth.” In this passage we see he endea¬ vours to gain the good esteem of his readers from two very powerful motives, modesty and a strict regard to truth. It may scarce seem necessary to observe, that those introductions are esteemed the best which are most natural ; that is, such as are taken from the sub¬ ject-matter of the history itself, and closely connected with it. Such are those of Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, and others. And therefore Sallust is greatly blamed by Quintilian on the account of his in¬ troductions, which are so general that they might suit other histories as well as those to which they are pre¬ fixed. Introductions should likewise be proportioned to the length of the work. We meet with some few histories, in which the writers immediately enter upon their subject, without any introduction ; as Xenophon in his Expedition of the younger Cyrus, and Caesar in his Commentaries of the Gallic and Civil Wars. But the latter does not profess to write a just history ; and therefore left himself more at liberty, as well in this res¬ pect as in some others",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"In a general history, the order of time cannot al¬ ways be preserved; though, where the actions of^ dif¬ ferent communities have respect to one as the princi¬ pal, they should all, as far as possible, he referred to the transactions of that state. But even here the se¬ veral affairs of those different states ought to be rela¬ ted separately, which will necessarily occasion the an¬ ticipating some things, and postponing others, so that they cannot all stand in the order of time in which they were performed. However, Velleius Paterculus says very justly with regard to this subject, “ That every entire action placed together in one view, is much better apprehended than if divided by different trifles.” In this case, therefore, for better preserving the chronology, it is usual with historians, when they have finished any particular narrative, in passing to the next, to express the time by some short and plain transition ; and sometimes to apologize for themselves, by assigning the reasons of their conduct. So Poly¬ bius, whose history is of this kind, says concerning himself: “ As in writing the actions of each year, in the order of time, I endeavour to represent the affairs of the same nation together in one summary view, it is plain that inconvenience must of course attend this 3 O R Y. Sect. II way of writing.” Curtins professes only to write the Composi actions of Alexander king of Macedon ; but his history nan of contains in it the principal affairs of the greatest states ,11 in the world during that period. Now although, in the course of those transactions, the war between Ar- chelaus governor ol Macedonia, and Agis king of Sparta, happened before the battle of Alexander at Arbela ; yet the historian not only relates that battle first, but carries on the account of Alexander s aflairs in Asia to the death of Darius without interruption; for which he gives this reason: “ If I should relate Lib. v",Asia,"MK,PH",6,"North Macedonia,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"the affairs of Alexander, which happened in the meanM,,<- time, either in Greece or Illyricum anti Thrace, each in their proper order and time, I must interrupt the affairs of Asia ; which it is much better to represent together in one continued series as they fell out, to the flight and death of Darius.” Such anachronisms, therefore, are nothing more than what necessarily arise sometimes from the nature of the subject: As every thing, the more complex it is, and contains under it a great number of parts, is more difficult to be digested in a regular order. But in a history composed of se¬ veral states, whose affairs are independent of one an¬ other, the actions of each nation must necessarily be separated, in order to represent bhem in a just view, and prevent confusion. This is the method which Herodotus has taken, as likewise Diodorus Siculus and Justin. Now both the pleasure and benefit which such histories afford, arise from observing the conduct of each state separately in the course of their affairs, and then comparing one with the other. And as the order of time must frequently be interrupted, it is not unusual to continue the chronology at proper distances in relating the affairs of each nation; which preserves an unity in the whole, and connects it in one consistent body. . , The division of histories into books was designed only for the better distinction of the subject and ease of the reader. And the dividing these hooks again into chapters, is rather a practice of latter editors (founded, as they have thought, on the same rea¬ sons), thaa countenanced by the example of ancient writers",Asia,"GR,PH",6,"Greece,Philippines","Europe,Asia"
"Cicero observes, that i(, nothing is more agreeable inj)^ cte history than brevity of expression, joined with puntyOrflt c 3 and perspicuity.” Purity indeed is not peculiar to his¬ tory, but yet it is absolutely necessary; ffir no one will ever think him fit to write a history who is not master of the language in which he writes: and there¬ fore when Albinus had written a history of the Roman affairs in Greek, and apologised for any slips or impro¬ prieties that might be found in the language upon the account of his being a Roman, Cato called him a triner, for choosing to do that which, after he had done it, he was obliged to ask pardon for doing.

"Vol. X. Part II. f 545 Now from these several properties laid down by an- Composi- cient writers, as requisite for an historical style, it seems tion of upon the whole to agree best with the middle charac-. Bi!8t0|y- ter. And this will further appear, by what they say v relating to the ornamental parts of style ; namely, com¬ position and dignity. As to the former of these, which respects the structure of sentences, and the several parts of them, Demetrius remarks, that “ An historical pe¬ riod ought neither to rise very high, nor sink very low, but to preserve a medium.” This simplicity (he says) “ becomes the gravity and credit of history j and dis¬ tinguishes it from oratory on the one hand, and dia¬ logue on the other.” His meaning is, that historical periods should neither be so full and sonorous as is fre¬ quent in oratory : nor yet so short and flat as in dia¬ logue : the former of which, as he says, require a strong voice to pronounce them} and the latter have scarce the appearance of periods. So that, according to this judicious writer, the periods best suited for history are those which, being of a moderate length, will admit of a just rise and cadency, and may he pronounced with ease. And Dionysius tells us, that “ History should flow smooth and even, everywhere consistent with itself, without roughness or chasms in the sound.” This re¬ lates to the harmony of periods, which arises from such a position of the words as renders the sound pleasant and agreeable, and as he thinks ought to be attended to in history. And as to dignity, which respects the use of tropes and figures, the same author says, that “ History should be embellished with such figures as are neither vehement nor carry in them the appearance of art.” This is agreeable to what Cicero observes, in comparing Xenophon and Calisthenes, two Greek his¬ torians. “ Xenophon the Socratic (says he) was the first philosopher, and after him Calisthenes the scholar of Aristotle, who wrote an history: the latter almost like a rhetorician : but the style of the former is more moderate, and has not the force of an orator, less vehe¬ ment perhaps, but in my opinion more sweet and plea¬ sant.” The difference between these two writers, with j)c Orat, regard to their style, consisted chiefly in the choice ofbb. ii",Cicero,"US,GR",6,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

At this juncture he was distinguished by an¬ other particular mark of the royal regard, by means of which the convocation was successively prorogued, and it was not permitted to sit, or do any business, till that resentment was entirely subsided. In 1721 he was translated to Hereford ; and from thence, in 1723, to Salisbury. In 1734, he was translated to Winchester (on the demise of Dr Willis), and pub¬ lished his Plain Account of the Sacrament: a perform¬ ance which served as a butt for his adversaries to shoot at; yet impartiality owns it to be clear, rational, and manly, written with great candour and judgment, and suited to the capacity of every serious and considerate inquirer after truth.—His latter days were embittered - by a most vile instance of fraud and ingratitude. The bishop took a French priest, who pretended to abjure his religion, under his protection, with no other re¬ commendation than that of his necessities; in return for which act of humanity, the priest found an opportunity of getting the bishop’s name written by his own hand, and, causing a note of some thousand pounds to be placed before it, offered it in payment. But the bishop deny¬ ing it to be his, it was brought before a court of justice, and was there found to be a gross imposition. The un¬ grateful villain had now recourse to a pamphlet, in which he charged the bishop with being a drunkard ; and alleged that he had the note of him when he was in liquor. To this calumny the bishop made a full and nervous answer; in which he exposed the man’s falsehood, and solemnly averred that he was never drunk in his whole life. The world with becoming ardour embraced bis defence, and he had the happi¬ ness to find himself perfectly acquitted even of any suspicion of such a charge. As a writer, he possessed uncommon abilities. His sermons (published in 1754 and 1755) are esteemed inferior to few writings in the English language, for plainness and perspicuity, ener¬ gy and strength of reasoning, and a free and masterly manner. In private life, he was naturally facetious, easy, and complying ; fond of company, yet would frequently leave it for the purposes of study or devo¬ tion. He was everywhere happy ; and particularly in his own family, where he took all opportunities of instructing by his influence and example. He died in 1761, aged 83.

"HOBBES, Thomas, a political writer, was born at Malmsbury in 1588. He was the son of a clergyman ; and having completed his studies at Oxford, he was af¬ terwards governor to the eldest son of William Caven¬ dish earl of Devonshire. He travelled through France and Italy with that young nobleman, and at length ap¬ plied himself entirely to ""the study of polite literature",Oxford,"FR,IT,US",6,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"In 1631, the countess dowager of Devonshire desired to put the young earl under his care, who was then 3 ^ 2 about HOB [ 548 3 HOB Hobbes, about the age of 13. This was very suitable to Mr -v-— Hobbes’s inclinations, who discharged that trust with great fidelity and diligence. In 1634, he republished his translation of Thucydides, and prefixed to it a de¬ dication to tiiat young nobleman, in which he gives a great character of his father, and represents in the strongest terms the obligations he was under to that illustrious family. The same year he accompanied his noble pupil to Paris, where he applied his vacant hours to the study of natural philosophy, and more especially to the perfect understanding of mechanism, and the causes of animal motion. He had frequent conversa¬ tions upon these subjects with Father Marin Mersenne $ a man deservedly famous, and who kept up a corre¬ spondence with almost all the learned in Europe. From Paris he attended his pupil into Italy, where at Pisa he became known to that great astronomer Galileo Gali¬ lei, who communicated to him his notions very freely $ and after having seen all that was remarkable in that country, he returned with the earl of Devonshire into England. Afterwards, foreseeing the civil wars, he went to seek a retreat at Paris ; where, by the good offices of his friend Father Mersenne, he became known to the famous Renatus des Cartes, and afterwards held a correspondence with him upon several mathematical subjects, as appears from the letters of Mr Hobbes pub¬ lished in the works of Des Cartes. But when this philosopher printed afterwards his Meditations, where¬ in he attempted to establish points of the highest conse¬ quence from innate ideas, Mr Hobbes took the liberty of dissenting from him; as did also the French king’s mathematical professor, the illustrious Peter Gassendi, with whom Mr Hobbes contracted a very close friend¬ ship, which was not interrupted till the death of the former. In 1642, Mr Hobbes printed a few copies of his famous hook De Give, which, in proportion as it became known, raised him many adversaries, who charged him with instilling principles which had a dangerous tendency. Among many illustrious persons who, upon shipwreck of the royal cause, retired to France for safety, was Sir Charles Cavendish, brother to the duke of Newcastle ; and this gentleman, being skilled in every branch of the mathematics, proved a constant friend and patron to Mr Hobbes $ who, by embarking in 1645 in a controversy about squaring the circle, was grown so famous for it, that in 1647 was recommended to instruct Charles prince of Wales, afterwards King Charles II. in mathematical learning","Paris, Paris, Pisa, Paris, Newcastle","US,IT,FR,ZA",6,"United States,Italy,France,South Africa","North America,Europe,Europe,Africa"
"His care in the discharge of this office gained him the esteem of that prince in a very high degree : and though lie afterwards withdrew his public favour to Mr Hobbes on account of his writings, yet he always retained a sense of the services he had done him 51 showed him various marks of his favour after he was restored to his dominions \ and, as some say, had his picture hanging in his closet. This year also was printed in Holland, by the care of M. Sorbiere, a second and more com¬ plete edition of his book De CzW; to which are pre¬ fixed two Latin letters to the editor, the one by Mr Gassendi, the other by Father Mersenne, in commen¬ dation of it: and in 1650 was published at London a small treatise of Mr Hobbes’s, entitled Human Nature ; and another He corpore politico, or “ Of the elements qf the law.” AU this time Mr Hobbes had been digesting with great care and pains his religious, political, and moral principles, into a complete system, which he called the ^ Leviathan, and which was printed in English at Lou¬ don in 1650 and 1651. After the publication of his Leviathan he returned to England, and passed the sum¬ mer commonly at his patron the earl of Devonshire’s seat in Derbyshire, and some of his winters in town, where he had for his intimate friends some of the great¬ est men of the age. In 1660, upon the Restoration, he quitted the country, and came up to London, where he obtained from the king assurance of protection, and had an annual pension of look settled upon him out of the privy purse. Yet this did not render him en¬ tirely safe : for, in 1666, his Leviathan and his trea¬ tise He Give were censured by parliament j which alarmed him very much, as did also the bringing in of a bill into the house of commons to punish atheism and profaneness. When this storm was a little blown over,, he began to think of procuring a beautiful edition of his pieces that were in Latin $ but finding this im¬ practicable in England, be caused it to be undertaken abroad, where they were published in quarto in 1668, from the press of John Bleau. In 1669, he was vi¬ sited by Cosmo de Medicis, then prince, afterwards duke of Tuscany, who gave him ample marks of his esteem and respect; and having received his picture, and a complete collection of his writings, caused them to be reposited, the former among his curiosities, the latter in his noble library at Florence. The like visits he received from foreign ambassadors and other strangers of distinction j who were curious to see a person whose singular opinions and numerous writings had made so much noise all over Europe. In 1672, he wrote his own life in Latin verse, when, as he observes, he had completed his 84th year: and, in 1674, he published in English verse four books of Homer’s Odyssey; which was so well received, that it encouraged him to under¬ take the whole Iliad and Odyssey, which he likewise performed and published in 1675. About this time he took his leave of London, and went to spend the remainder of his days in Derbyshire : where, however, he did not remain inactive, notwithstanding his ad¬ vanced age ; hut published from time to time several pieces, to be found in the collection of his works. He died in 1679, aSe^ 92, As to his character and manners, they are thus de¬ scribed by Dr White Kennet, in his Memoirs of the Cavendish family. “ The earl of Devonshire (says he) for his whole life entertained Mr Hobbes in his family, as his old tutor rather than as his friend or confidant. He let him live under his rool in ease and plenty, and in his own way, without making use of him in any public, or so much as domestic affairs. He would frequently put off the mention of his name, and say, ‘ He was a humorist, and nobody could account for him.’ There is a tradition in the family, of the manners and customs of Mr Hobbes, somewhat obser¬ vable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to his exercise, and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore, at his first rising, he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach $ or if the weather was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, to be in a sweat: recom¬ mending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had more moisture than heat, and therefore by such IJoi.hr HOB [ 549 3 HOC ] jbes, such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture ex- bby. pelted. Alter this, he took a comfortable breakfast $ ’ ’ ' and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the children, and any consider¬ able strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He kept these rounds till about 12 o’clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he ate always by himself without ceremony. Soon af¬ ter dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle with 10 or 12 pipes of tobacco laid by him ; then shut¬ ting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and wri¬ ting for several hours. He retained a friend or two at court, and especially the lord Arlington, to protect him if occasion should require. He used to say, that it was lawful to make use of ill instruments to do our¬ selves good : * If I were cast (says he) into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to be drawn out by it.’ After the Re¬ storation, he watched all opportunities to ingratiate himself with the king and his prime ministers; and look¬ ed upon his pension to be more valuable, as an earnest of favour and protection, than upon any other account","Holland, London, Of, London, Florence, London, Arlington","US,GB,UK,TR",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A,Turkey","North America,Europe,N/A,Asia"

"This extraordinary man, and particular favourite of fortune, was born on the 24th of June 1768, at the village of Montreuil, in the suburbs of Versailles. His father, in the early part of his life, had been a soldier ; but acted afterwards in the capacity of a menial ser¬ vant, and was appointed to feed the hounds of Louis XV. His mother died soon after the birth of young Hoche, by which he was left in a great measure desti- tute, , HOC [ 550 ] HO C ITodie- tute’ aSe^ fat!ier (t5ien about 72) ^eing unable to  r-^ contribute to his support. By the humanity of an aunt, however, who kept a green stall at Versailles, he was rescued from absolute beggary. She sent him to a small school, where he acquired a tolerable know¬ ledge of reading and writing, shewing himself at once the"" best and most mischievous scholar in the whole school. He was made a chorister by the rector of St tiermain-en-Laye, because he found him to be a boy of a very lively disposition. He very soon discovered an insatiable thirst for information upon every subject, asking questions at those who were much older than himself, and listening with the utmost attention to the answers they returned. The ingenuity of his remarks and inquiries was often perplexing to others ; hut as he gradually approached towards manhood, a very re¬ markable change took place, both in his manners and disposition. His loquacity was succeeded by a musing, contemplative turn, and he proved by the importance of his conversation, that he had not meditated in vain","Montreuil, Versailles, Versailles",FR,6,France,Europe
"Finding that his wants grew more numerous than could be supplied by the industry of his aunt, he form¬ ed the commendable resolution of earning his own sub¬ sistence, and accordingly became a sort of assistant in the royal stables of Versailles. His ardent character, however, soon found this situation by far too degrading $ he already viewed it with abhorrence 5 and having ac¬ cidentally met with some part of the works of Rousseau, a spirit of independence instantly seized upon him. Ap¬ prehending that he might better his situation by going abroad, to which he was strongly urged by a rascal who made a prey of him, even offered him money to enable him to prosecute the undertaking, and then gave him to understand that he was now a soldier in the French guards. Hoche, finding it wholly unavailing to remon¬ strate, was sent at the age of 16 to join his regiment, which was then quartered at Paris. Here he found himself possessed of no more than I25livres (about 5I","Versailles, Paris","FR,US",6,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Soon after this period appeared the celebrated pam¬ phlet of Sieyes respecting the Third Estate, and almost every Frenchman was ready to prove that he belonged to it. The guards, it is well known, took a decided part with the people 5 and on the 14th of July 1789? Hoche, at the head of his companions, was among the first who seized on the Bastile. The guards were formed into the I02d, 103d, and 104th regiments, into the last of which Hoche was admitted with the rank of second adjutant, when he had an opportunity of ma¬ nifesting his talents in a different channel. Improper hands having obtained the administration of the military hospital of the French guards, he minutely investigated the state of the accounts, which had been veiled with ambiguity for the purpose of deceiving. He amended the discipline of the army, and his active talents did not pass unrewarded. While the regiment was reviewed in the Elysian fields, Servan, the minister at war, was so delighted with the platoons of Hoche’s company, that he enquired who the young man was by whom it was conducted, and he bestowed on him some flattering com¬ pliments, and in four days after sent him the brevet of lieutenant in the regiment of Ronergue. Pie left Paris on the 24th of June 1792, in order to join his regi¬ ment, then in garrison at Thionville. General Leve- neur, who held the command in the absence of Va¬ lence, sent LieutenantPIoche with aregiment of hussars, to procure provisions for the troops which Miranda had ordered to lav siege to Maestricht. This he executed with universal applause •, and when the army of the Ardennes was ordered to recross the Meuse, Hoebe succeeded in removing the powder from the abbey of Merchen, in bringing away the military chest of the division, and conducting the sick in the hospital, wlien every thing appeared to be in the power of the enemy’s hussars.

"When the British troops and the Austrians besieged Dunkirk, Houchard, who was ordered to cover the place, threw in supplies under the command of Souham and Adjutant-general Houche, the latter of whom in¬ spired all around him with enthusiasm ; keeping up the spirits of the troops and harassing the enemy by frequent sallies, while the right wing and centre of the besieging army were attacked by Jourdan. Hoche constructed several advanced works before the place, and for six weeks together was never in a bed. The representa¬ tives with the army, as a reward for his activity, ap¬ pointed him chief of brigade",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"Having obtained this rank, he was sent, into Austrian Flanders, where invariable success attended all his movements. And when only 24 years of age, he was appointed commander in chief of the army of the Mo- xelle, which had remained for a long time inactive, and even experienced some disgrace under Houchard. Few scenes of action could be mare inauspicious than that upon which Hoche was now about to enter. The Aus¬ trians and Prussians were about 100,000 strong, under the command of the first officers in Europe, which presented a formidable front from the Upper Palatinate to the Hundsruck : and almost every position might be deemed impregnable. The troops of General Hocbe were nearly undisciplined, and the nature of their situa¬ tion rendered them dispirited 5 but their leader first en¬ deavoured to gain their confidence, which be conceived made a general invincible ; he restored military disci¬ pline \ investigated the characters and talents of his of¬ ficers ; and punished or rewarded as necessity required",,AT,6,Austria,Europe
"To inspire the inhabitants on the frontiers with cou¬ rage was his next object, for which purpose he visited the difl’erent towns in his vicinity, frequented popular societies, and addressed them in person ; so that he not only secured a high degree of confidence, but even pro¬ cured volunteers, clothes, and provisions. Having re¬ ceived instructions from the committee of public safety to raise the siege of Bitche and Landau j he drew a number of troops from the different garrisons, and on the event of an attack on the quarter he had weakened, he gave orders to General Moreau to shut himself up in Thionville, which place he was charged to defend until death. He formed such a general plan of opera¬ tions as gave the strongest evidence of his great milita¬ ry talents ; for if the subordinate parts of it miscarried (which was actually the case), the grand object, the effecting a junction with Pichegru, who commanded the army on the Rhine, was still within his reach. By a sudden and formidable manoeuvre, he so astonished the enemy, that they immediately quitted the Sarre, and 5 after experiencing a defeat, retired towards the heights Hoclie",Thionville,FR,6,France,Europe
"The victorious Hoche afterwards made himself master of Germersheim; Worms and Spires opened their gates to receive him, and Fort \ anban was retaken. It was his determination to cross the Rhine at Strasburgh, or Offendorf, and venture into the heart of Germany with 25,000 men 5 to which movement Pichegru was un¬ friendly, and had the address to prevail with the repre¬ sentatives then present to refuse their sanction. Robe¬ spierre now regarded him with a jealous eye 5 all his plans were treated with unmerited indignity, and his arrest was resolved on. This, however, would have been a desperate attempt at the head of his victorious troops, and therefore he was offered the chief command of the army of Italy j but no sooner had he arrived at Nice than he was sent a prisoner to Paris, where he remain¬ ed confined for many months, almost entirely forgotten","Germersheim, Worms, Nice, Paris","DE,IT,FR,US",6,"Germany,Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"
"He was appointed to the command of the army destined to protect the coasts of Cherbourg, a situation which by no means agreed with his disposition ; for he was often heard to exclaim “ how much happier are they who fight against the Prussians !” His situation was indeed disagreeable, for it was Frenchmen fighting against Frenchmen, and he succeeded a number of ge¬ nerals who had been nearly all of them degraded. His keen discernment enabled him to observe that igno¬ rance and superstition were at the bottom of the con¬ test, which made him adopt a plan of procedure very different from those of his predecessors 5 and he made this singular assertion to the committee of public safety, that a “few proclamations would be productive of in¬ finitely more effect than sixteen pounders.” He check¬ ed the depredations of his own soldiers, restored the confidence of the peasantry, and so highly satisfied the government, that the command of the district of Brest was committed to him. So prolligate and abandoned had been the conduct of his predecessors, that he could not HOC [ 552 ] HOC Hoche. not procure a lodging at Rennes, which he had come —— to protect from the insurgents, although he ofiered an extravagant price for it. Soon, however, was he enabled to disarm their prejudices; for instead of hunting down the priests, he allowed the celebration of the mass, or¬ dered the clergy to be protected, and took many of the confessors into pay. These were not like the plans of so young a man ; they would have done honour to one who had studied human nature much longer than he had been in existence","Brest, Rennes",FR,6,France,Europe
"His next great military project was an expedition against Guernsey and Jersey, which we are told, was rejt-cted by the influence of Boissy d’Anglas, who was at that time a member of the committee of public safety. But having obtained the chief command of the army of the W^est, the whole charge of the war in La Vendee was committed to his management, to which he was resolved to put a glorious termination, presenting the deluded people with the olive branch in one hand, and the sword in the other. Having granted a pardon to all who had been deceived, be proposed to ' 3 unite the armies of Cherburg, Brest, and the West, un- der the appellation of the army of the coasts of the Ocean, which by the influence of Barras, was instantly adopted. Having marched against Charette with a body of troops, that chief was seized and ordered to be executed. In passing through Sartbe, Maine, Loire, and Morbihan, with his moving columns, he gave no quar¬ ter to the chiefs; but when he beheld the ignorant pea¬ santry in arms, and at his mercy, he used to exclaim, These unfortunate people are Frenchmen ! He de¬ clared the principal towns to be no longer in a state of siege; abolished martial law, dissolved military tri¬ bunals ; and, after succeeding in the accomplishment of his wishes in the space of eight weeks, he was honoured with the title of Pacificator of La Ven¬ dee","Brest, Barras","GG,JE,FR,BR",6,"Guernsey,Jersey,France,Brazil","Europe,Europe,Europe,South America"
"The next object which attracted his whole attention was the conquest of England, a country with which he appears to hare been little acquainted. His plan, how¬ ever, was much approved of by the minister of marine (Truguet) ; but every thing was wanting for the accom¬ plishment of an undertaking so very extraordinary ; and the attempt was restricted to Ireland alone. For this purpose he set out for Brest, and procured the re¬ moval of Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse, because he was ini¬ mical to his favourite project. General Hoche super¬ intended the dock-yards, hastened the public works, and prepared every thing connected with a great na¬ val equipment. It was the declaration of Rear-admiral Bruix, who fell at Aboukir, that Hoche would become the best minister of marine that France ever beheld, if he had only a single year’s experience. When every thing was in readiness for the proposed descent upon Ireland, General Hoche embarked on board the frigate La Fraternity this being the first time he was ever at sea. In a gale of wind he was separated from his ar¬ my, which consisted of 15,000 men; part of the fleet appeared off the coast of Ireland, and some ships enter¬ ed Bantry Bay; but without their general they could undertake nothing ; and therefore after holding a coun¬ cil of war, they determined to return. General Hoche arrived some time after, but learning that the fleet had given up the enterprise, he steered back to the French coast, weeping, it is said, when be got the last sight of Ireland",Brest,"IE,FR",6,"Ireland,France","Europe,Europe"

He then pur¬ sued the enemy to Dierdorff, which they were forced to abandon, while he encamped at Montabaur and Al- tenkirchen.

"HQGABTH, William, a truly great and original genius, is said by Dr Burn to have been the descend¬ ant of a family originally from Kirby There, in West¬ moreland. His father, who had been a schoolmaster in the same county, went early to London, where he was employed as a corrector of the press j and appears to have been a man of some learning, a dictionary in La¬ tin and English, which he composed for the use of schools, being still existing in MS. He married in London, and kept a school in Ship-Court, in the Old Bailey. Our hero was born in 1697 or 1698, in the parish of St Martin, Ludgate. The outset of his life, however, was unpromising. “ He was bound,” says Mr W alpole, “ to a mean engraver of arms on plate.” Hogarth probably chose this occupation, as it requir¬ ed some skill in drawing: to which his genius was par¬ ticularly turned, and which he contrived assiduously to cultivate. His master, it since appears, was Mr Ellis Gamble, a silversmith of eminence, who resided in Cran- burn-street, Leicester-fields. In this profession it is not unusual to bind apprentices to the single branch of engraving arms and cyphers on every species of metal j and in that particular department of the business young Hogarth was placed ; “ but, before his time was ex- “ pired, he felt the impulse of genius, and that it di- “ reeled him to painting.” During his apprentice¬ ship, he set out one Sunday, with two or three com¬ panions, on an excursion to Highgate. The weather being hot, they went into a public house, where they had not been long before a quarrel arose between some persons in the same room. One of the disputants struck the other on the head with a quart pot, and cut him very much. The blood running down the man’s face, together with the agony of the wound, which had dis¬ torted his features into a most hideous grin, presented Hogarth, who showed himself thus early “ apprised of the mode Nature had intended he should pursue,” with too laughable a subject to be overlooked. He drew out bis pencil, and produced on the spot one of the most ludicrous figures that ever was seen. What rendered this piece the more valuable was, that it ex¬ hibited an exact likeness of the man, with the portrait of his antagonist, and the figures in caricature of the principal persons gathered round him","London, London","GB,UK",6,"United Kingdom,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Mr Walpole has remarked, that if our artist “ in¬ dulged his spirit of ridicule in personalities, it never proceeded beyond sketches and drawings and won¬ ders “ that he never, without intention, delivered the very features of any identical person.” Mr Nichols as¬ sures us, from unquestionable authority, that almost all the personages who attended the levee of the Rake were undoubted portraits; and that in “ Southwark Fair,” and the “ Modern Midnight Conversation,” as many more were discoverable. While Hogarth was painting the “ Rake’s Progress,” he had a summer residence at Isleworth ; and never failed to question the company who came to see these pictures, if they knew for whom one or another figure was designed.

"The duke of Leeds has an original scene in the ‘‘ Beggar’s Opera,” painted by Hogarth. It is that in which Lucy and Polly are on their knees, before their respective fathers, to intercede for the life of the hero of the piece. All the figures are either known or supposed to be portraits. If we are not misinformed, the late Sir Thomas Robinson (perhaps better known by the name of Long Sir Thomas) is standing in one of the side-boxes. Macbeatb, unlike his spruce repre¬ sentative on our present stage, is a slouching bully; and Polly appears happily disencumbered of such a hoop as the daughter of Peachum within our younger memories has worn. Mr Walpole has a picture of a scene in the same piece, where Macheath is going to execution. In this also the likenesses of Walker, and Miss Fenton, afterwards duchess of Bolton (the first and original Macheath and Polly) are preserved. In the year 1726, when the affair of Mary Tofts, the rabbit-breedeV of Godaiming, engaged the public at¬ tention, a few of our principal surgeons subscribed their guinea a-pieee to Hogarth, for an engraving from a ludicrous sketch he had made on that verv po¬ pular subject. Ibis plate, among other portraits, contains that of St Andie, then anatomist to the royal household, and in high credit as a surgeon. In 1727, Hogarth agreed with Morris an upholsterer to furnish him with a design on canvas, representing the element of earth as a pattern for tapestry.

"The ingenious Abbe Du Bos has often complained that no bistory-painter of his time went through a se¬ ries of actions, and thus, like an historian, painted the successive fortunes of an hero from the cradle to the grave. - What Du Bos wished to see done, Hogarth performed. He launches out his young adventurer a simple girl upon the town, and conducts her through all the vicissitudes of wretchedness to a premature death. This was painting to the understanding and to the heart; none had ever before made the pencil subservient to the purposes of morality and instruc¬ tion : a hook like this is fitted to every soil and every observer ; and he that runs may read. Nor was the success of Hogarth confined to his persons. One of his excellencies consisted in what may he termed the furniture of his pieces; for as, in sublime and histori¬ cal representations, the fewer trivial circumstances are permitted to divide the spectator’s^attention from the principal figures, the greater is their force ; so, in scenes copied from familiar life, a proper variety of little domestic images contributes to throw a degree of verisimilitude on the whole. “ The Rake’s levee- room,” says Mr Walpole, “ the nobleman’s dining¬ room, the apartments of the husband and wife in Mar¬ riage a la Mode, the alderman’s parlour, the bed-cham¬ ber, and many others, are the history of the manners of the age.” In 1745, Hogarth sold about 20 of his capital pic¬ tures by auction 5 and in the same year acquired addi¬ tional reputation by the six prints of “ Marriage a la Mode,” which may be regarded as the ground-work of a novel called “ The Marriage Act,” by Dr Sheb- beare, and of “ The Clandestine Marriage.” Soon after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, he went over to France, and was taken into custody at Calais while he was drawing the gate of that town ; a cir¬ cumstance which he has recorded in his picture, enti¬ tled, “ O the Roast Beef of Old England !” published March 26. 1749* He was actually carried before the governor as a spy, and after a very strict examination committed a prisoner to Gransire, his landlord, on his promising that Hogarth should not go out of his house till lie was to embark for England","Calais, March","FR,GB",6,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"Mr Hogarth applied to his neighbour Mr Ralph 5 but it was impossible for two such persons to agree, both alike vain and positive. He proceeded no farther than about a sheet, and they then parted friends, and seem to have continued such. The kind office of finishing the work, and superintending the publication, was lastly taken up by Dr Morell, who went through the remainder of the book. The preface was in like man¬ ner corrected by the Reverend Mr Townley. The family of Hogarth rejoiced when the last sheet of the “ Analysis,” was printed off j as the frequent disputes he had with his coadjutors, in the progress of the work, did not much harmonize his disposition. This work was translated into German by Mr Mylins, when in England, under the author’s inspection j and the trans¬ lation was printed in London, price five dollars. A new and correct edition was in 1754 proposed for pub¬ lication at Berlin, by Ch. Fr.

"Hogarth had one failing in common with most peo¬ ple who attain wealth and eminence without the aid of liberal education.—Fie affected to despise every kind of knowledge which he did not possess. Having esta¬ blished his fame with little or no obligation to litera¬ ture, he either conceived it to he needless, or decried it because it lay out of his reach. His sentiments, in short, resembled those of Jack Cade, who pronounced sentence on the clerk of Chatham because he could write and read. Till, in evil hour, this celebrated ar¬ tist commenced author, and was obliged to employ the friends already mentioned to correct his “ Analysis of Beauty,” he did-not seem to have discovered that even spelling was a necessary qualification 5 and yet he had ventured to ridicule the late Mr Rich’s deficiency as to this particular, in a note which lies before the Rake whose play is refused while he remains in confinement for debt. Previous to the time of which we are now speaking, one of our artist’s common topics of decla¬ mation was the uselessness of books to a man ot Ins profession. In “ Beer-street,” among other volumes consigned by him to the pastry-cook, we find Turn- bull “ on Ancient Paintinga treatise which Ho¬ garth should have been able to understand before he ventured to condemn. Garrick himself, however, was not more ductile to flattery. A word in praise of “ Sigismunda,” his favourite work, might have com¬ manded a proof print, or forced an original sketch out of our artist’s hands. The following authenticated story of our artist will also serve to show how much more easy it is to detect ill placed or hyperbolical adu¬ lation respecting others than when applied to ourselves","Chatham, Ho","GB,GH",6,"United Kingdom,Ghana","Europe,Africa"

Handel is a giant in music j” Greene only a light Florimel kind of a com¬ poser.”—“ Aye,” says our artist’s informant j “ but at the same time Mr Freke declared you were as good a portrait-painter as Vandyck.”—“ There he was in the right,” adds Hogarth $ “ and so by G— I am, give me my time, and let me choose my subject !” A specimen of Hogarth’s propensity to merriment, on the most trivial occasions, is observable in one of his cards requesting the company of Dr Arnold King to dine with him at the Mitre. Within a circle, to which a knife and fork are the supporters, the written part is contained. In the centre is drawn a pye, with a mitre on the top of it; and the invitation of our artist concludes with the following sport on the Greek letters—to Tta Beta Pi.

"Holbein said that he had forgot his title, but remem¬ bered his face so well, that he believed he could draw his likeness 5 which he did so perfectly, that the noble¬ man, it is said, was immediately known by it. The chancellor having now adorned his apartments with the productions of this great painter, resolved to introduce him to Henry VIII. For this purpose he invited that prince to an entertainment; having, before he came, hung up all Holbein’s pieces in the great hall, in the best order, and placed in the best light. The king, on his first entrance into this room, was so charmed with the sight, that he asked whether such an artist was now alive, and to be had for money ? Upon this, Sir Thomas presented Holbein to his majesty, who immediately took him into his service, and brought him into great esteem with the nobility and gentry, by which means he drew a vast number of portraits. But while he was here, there happened an affair which might have proved fatal to him, had he not been pro¬ tected by the king. On the report of this painter’s character, a lord of the first quality came to see him when he was drawing a figure after the life. Holbein sent to desire bis lordship to defer the honour of his visit to another day ; which the nobleman taking for an afiront, broke open the door, and very rudely went up stairs. Holbein hearing a noise, came out of his chamber ; and meeting the lord at his door, fell into a violent passion, and pushed him backwards from the top of the stairs to the bottom^ However, immediately reflecting on what he had done, he escaped from the tumult he had raised, and made the best of his way to the king. The nobleman, much hurt, though not so much as he pretended, was there soon after him ; and Holbein Upon opening his grievance, the king ordered Holbein || to ask his pardon. But this only irritated the noble-, Holdc1'- man the more, who would not be satisfied with less * "" than his life; upon which the king sternly replied, “ My lord, you have not now to do with Holbein but with me; whatever punishment you may contrive by way of revenge against him, shall certainly be in¬ flicted on yourself. Remember, pray, my lord, that I can whenever I please make seven lords of seven ploughmen, but I cannot make one Holbein of even seven lords.” Holbein died of the plague at his lodg¬ ings at Whitehall in 1554* “ It is amazing (says De Piles, that a man born in Switzerland, and who had never been in Italy, should have so good a .g&sYo, and so fine a genius for painting.” He painted alike in every manner; in fresco, in water-colours, in oil, and in miniature. His genius was sufficiently shown in the historical style, by two celebrated compositions which he painted in the hall of the Stillyard company. He was also eminent for a rich vein of invention, which he showed in a multitude of designs which he drew for engravers, statuaries, jewellers, &c. and he had this singularity, that he painted with his left band",Whitehall,"CH,IT,US",6,"Switzerland,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"HOLINGSHED, Ralph, or Raphael, was one of the humble but useful class of historians called chro~ nologers. He was educated at Cambridge, according to Bishop Tanner, and became A. M. in the year 1544. The nature and extent of his education, as well as his profession, are involved in uncertainty. It seems probable, however, that he was steward to Thomas Burdett, Esq. of Bomcote in Warwickshire, where he died about the year 1580. He has given name to a compilation of Chronicles of English history from the earliest times, the first edition of which was published at London in 1577, in two volumes folio, and the se¬ cond edition in three volumes, was printed about seven years after his death, brought down to 1586. Ibis work, according to the testimony of Holingshed him¬ self, was begun by the advice of Reginald Wolfe, prin¬ ter to Queen Elizabeth. Part of it was compiled by himself, but he received considerable assistance from William Harrison, John Hooker, Abraham Fleming, Francis Tbvnne, and some others. It was continued by John Stowe after the death of Holingshed. Some parts of the first edition were altered in the second and third, because they gave offence to Queen Elizabeth and the ministry, who laid many restrictions on the liberty of the press. The first edition of consequence is both scarce and valuable ; but the suppressed sheets were afterwards printed by themselves.

Its greatest extent from north to south including the island of Texel, is about 90 English miles j but from east to west its extent varies from 40 to 25. To defend it against the sea, dykes have been erected at an immense expence, and innumerable canals cut to drain it, as being naturally very low and marshy. Some parts of the province are very fruitful in corn j but the greater part consists of rich pastures, wherein are kept large herds of kine, which supply them with incredible quantities of butter and cheese. Of the latter, that of Edam, in North Holland, is highly esteemed. The many rivers and canals that intersect the province are of great advantage to its commerce, but contribute to render the air foggy and unwholesome. There is a Communication by water betwixt almost every town and village. Towards the middle also of the province are great numbers of turf-pits. The number of the inha¬ bitants in 1817 was 748,000. In point of cleanliness no country surpasses, and few come up to it, especially in North Holland, and that even in the villages. From the counts of Holland this province devolved, in 1436, to the dukes of Burgundy, and from them to the house of Austria, along with the other provinces. By the an¬ cient constitution of the country the states of Holland and West Friesland were composed of the nobility and deputies of the towns ; of the latter there were 18 that sent deputies to the assembly of the states, which was held at the Hague. The grand pensionary was a person of great dignity and weight in this assembly, and his office required extraordinary abilities. There were also two councils composed of deputies, one for South and another for North Holland, who had the cognizance of the revenue and military affairs. The whole province sent one deputy from among the noblesse to the states- general, who took precedence of all others, together with three or four more. There were two supreme courts of judicature for Holland and Zealand ; viz. the great council of Holland and Zealand, and the hof or court of Holland. To these appeals lay from the towns 5 but the causes of noblemen came before them in the first instance. With respect to the ecclesiastical government, there is a synod held annually both in South and North Holland, of which the former con¬ tains eleven classes, and the latter six ; and the mini¬ sters of both together amount to 331.

"Soon after the commencement of the French revo¬ lution, this ill-fated country became the theatre of war, the old government was subverted, and the stadtholder having fled to England for safety, the republican rulers of France imposed a political constitution upon it ac¬ cording to their pleasure. The infatuated people of Holland received their conquerors with apparent, perhaps with real satisfaction at first 5 but experience fatally taught them the pernicious nature of the change. As the government of France changed from directorial to consular, and from consular to imperial, that of Holland also received various modifications, till at last it was converted into a monarchy under one of Bonaparte’s brothers, who afterwards withdrew from his kingdom, and then Holland was annex- Vol. X.

"In 1619, Jan Van Edels gave his name to a southern part of New Holland. Another part situated between 30 and 330 received the name of Leuwen. Peter Van Nuitz gave his name, in 1627, to a coast which com¬ municates to Leuwen’s Land towards the westward j and a part of the western coast, near the tropic of Ca¬ pricorn, bore the name of De Wit's.

A great variety of birds were met with, which have since been particu¬ larly described j but the number of quadrupeds bears but a very small proportion to that of tbe other ani¬ mals. The most remarkable insects seen at this time were the green ants (a), who build their nests upon trees in a very singular manner. 3 This country has now become an object of more Settlement consequence than formerly, by reason of the establish-of a Bntifli ment of a British colony in it $ where the criminals condemned to be transported are sent to pass their time lan(j of servitude. Before this plan was resolved on by govern¬ ment, another had been discussed, viz. that of employ¬ ing these criminals in workhouses j and Judge Black- stone, with Mr Eden and Mr Howard, had con¬ sidered of the best method of putting it in execution j but though this plan had been approved by parliament as early as 1779, some difficulties always occurred, which prevented its going forward j and at length on the 6th of December 1786, orders were issued by his majesty in council for making a settlement on New Holland, establishing a court of judicature in the colony, and other regulations necessary on the oc¬ casion. The whole received the complete sanction of legislature in the beginning of the year 1787. The squadron appointed for putting the design in execution began to assemble at the Mother Bank, the place of rendezvous, in the Isle of Wight, on the 16th of March 1787. It consisted of the Sirius frigate Cap¬ tain John Hunter, the Supply armed tender Lieute¬ nant (a) These little animals form their habitations, by bending down the leaves of trees, and glueing the ends of them together, so as to form a purse. Though these leaves are as broad as a man’s hand, they perform this feat by main strength, thousands of them being employed in holding down the leavesj while multitudes of others apply the glutinous matter. Captain Cook’s people ascertained themselves that this was the case, by some¬ times disturbing them at their work ; in which case the leaf always sprung up with an elasticity, which they could not have supposed that such minute insects were capable of overcoming. For this curiosity, however, they smarted pretty severely j for thousands of these little enemies instantly threw themselves upon the aggres¬ sors, and revenged themselves by their bites or stings for the interruption they had met with. These were little less painful at first than the sting of a bee j but the pain did not last above a minute. Another species of ants burrow themselves in the root of a plant which grows on the bark of trees like the misletoe, and which is com¬ monly as big as a large turnip. When this is cut, it appears intersected with innumerable winding passages all filled with these animals j notwithstanding which, the vegetation of the plant suffers no injury. These do not give pain by their stings, but produce an intolerable itching by crawling about on the skin. They are about the size of the small red ant in this country. Another sort, which do not molest in any manner, resemble the white ant of the East Indies.

In this they succeeded to their wish ; and were about to depart on the 9th of June, when it was discovered that one of the convicts had made his escape, having found means to cut away a boat and make off with it.

"The rest of the fleet arrived in two days after the Supply j and that no time might be lost, Governor Phillip ordered the ground about Point Sutherland to be cleared, and preparations to be made for landing, while he went with several officers in three boats to exa¬ mine Port Jackson, which was only three leagues di¬ stant. Here they bad the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world, where 1000 sail of the line might ride in perfect safety. On examining the different coves, one was preferred which had a fine run of spring water, and where ships could anchor so close to the shore, that at a very small expence quays might be constructed for loading and unloading the largest vessels. This was named by the governor Sydney Cove, in honour of Lord Sydney, and the country around it destined for the place of settlement. It is about half a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad at the en¬ trance.

They had touched at the island of Santa Catharina on the coast of Brasil, and from thence gone by the extremity of South America into the Pacific ocean, where they had run along by the coasts of Chili and California; after which they had visited Easter Island, Nootka Sound, Cook’s river, Kamtschatka, Manilla, the isles des Na- vigateurs, and the Sandwich and Friendly Isles. -They had also attempted to land on Norfolk Island, but found it impossible on account of the surf.

"Their first landing was at the head of a small cove country, named Shell-covey near the entrance of the harbour on the north side. Proceeding in this direction, they ar¬ rived with great labour at a large lake, surrounded on all sides with bog and marshy ground to a considerable extent, and in which they frequently plunged up to the waist. Here they observed that bird so rare in other parts of the world, viz. a black swan. On being fired at, it rose, and shewed that its wings were edged with white, the bill being tinged red. They spent three days in a very laborious manner in passing the marshes and swamps which lie in the neighbourhood of the har¬ bour : and here they had an opportunity of observing, that all the small streams which descend into Port Jack- son proceed from swamps, occasioned by the stagnation of the water in the low grounds as it rises from the springs. On leaving these low grounds, they found them succeeded by a rocky and barren country $ the hills covered with various flowering shrubs, though fre¬ quently inaccessible by reason of various natural obsta¬ cles. At about 15 miles distance from the sea, the go¬ vernor had a fine view of the internal parts of the coun¬ try, which were mountainous. To the most northerly chain of these he gave the name of Carmarthen, and to the most southerly that of Lansdown Hills ; and to one which lay between these he gave the name of Richmond Hill.

During all this time they had not proceeded farther in a direct line than 30 miles, so great were the obstructions they had met with from deep ravines, &c. Their return, however, was effected with much greater ease, having cleared a track, and marked trees all the way as they went along to direct them in their journey back. The country explored at this time appeared so fine, that Governor Phillip determined to form a settlement there as soon as a sufficient number could be spared from those works which were immedi¬ ately necessary.

"The 4th of June being his majesty’s birth-day, was celebrated with as much festivity as circumstances would allow; and on this occasion it was first made public that the governor had given the name of Cumberland County to this part of the territory. The appointed boundaries were Carmarthen and Lansdown hills on the west, the northern parts of Broken Bay on the north, and the southern parts of Botany Bay on the south ; thus including these three principal bays, with Sydney Cove nearly in the centre. r The misfortunes which attended those convicts who A coink strayed to too great a distance from the settlement, exee'llfl1 were not sufficient to prevent some of them from ramb¬ ling into the woods, in hopes of subsisting themselves there and regaining their liberty. One of these, who had been guilty of a robbery, fled into the woods on the 5th of June, but was obliged to return half-starved on the 24th. He had found it impossible to subsist in the woods, and had met with very little relief from the natives. One of them gave him a fish, but made signs • for him to go away. According to his account, they themselves were in a very miserable situation ; and he pretended to have seen four of them apparently dying of hunger, who made signs to him for something to eat. He pretended also to have fallen in with a party who would have burnt him, and that he made his es¬ cape f»;om them with difficulty. He said also, that he had seen the remains of a human body lying on a fire ; and endeavoured to inculcate the idea of these savages eating human flesh when other provisions were scarce","Cumberland, Carmarthen, Sydney","US,GB,CA",6,"United States,United Kingdom,Canada","North America,Europe,North America"
"A good number of others have unaccountably disap¬ peared, and are supposed to have been murdered by the natives, or perished with hunger in the woods j so that, unless the numbers be recruited by more respec¬ table inhabitants, it is not likely that much can be ex¬ pected from the Port Jackson settlement for a long time to come. Of this, however, there seems to be little doubt: the general spirit of emigration which prevails through most, indeed we may say all the coun¬ tries of Europe, will undoubtedly soon supply a suffi¬ cient number j and even some of the Americans, not¬ withstanding the extent and fertility of their own country, and the liberty they enjoy in it, are said to be willing to exchange these blessings for the precari¬ ous hopes of what may be obtained in New Holland among British convicts and slaves. This rambling dis¬ position may perhaps be accounted for from an obser¬ vation which has been made, viz. that “ it may admit of a doubt whether many of the accommodations of a civilized life be not more than counterbalanced by the artificial wants to whioh they give birth. That these accommodations do not give a satisfaction equivalent to the trouble with which they are procured, is certain ; jj0j_ and it is no wonder, then, to find numbers of people in land, every country who are willing to exchange them for'—""v— independent ease and tranquillity, which belong, com¬ paratively speaking, to few individuals in those coun¬ tries which are called civilized.” jg With regard to the geography of this extensive General country, which may perhaps be reckoned a fifth gene-acconnt of ral division of the world, Captains Cook and Furneaux1^6 c<jUn' so fully explored its coast, that succeeding navigators tfy* have added little to their labours.

"HOLLAR, Wenceslaus, a celebrated engraver, born at Prague in 1607. His parents were in a gen¬ teel line of life ; and he was at first designed for the study of the law. But the civil commotions which happened in his youth, ruining his family afi’airs, he was obliged to shift for himself; and by discovering some genius for the arts, he was placed with Marian, a very able designer and engraver of views. Being himself a man of great ingenuity, he profited hastily from the instruction of his tutor. He principally ex¬ celled in drawing geometrical and perspective views and plans of buildings, ancient and modern cities and towns ; also landscapes, and every kind of natural and artificial curiosities, which he executed with a pen in a very peculiar style, excellently well adapted to the pur¬ pose. He travelled through several of the great cities of Germany : and, notwithstanding all his merit, met with so little encouragement, that he found it very dif¬ ficult to support himself. The earl of Arundel being in Germany, took him under his protection, brought him to England, and recommended him to the favour of Charles I. He engraved a variety of plates from the Arundel collection, and the portrait of the earl him¬ self on horseback. The civil wars which happened soon after in England, ruined his fortune. He was ta¬ ken prisoner, with some of the royal party, and with difficulty escaped j when he returned to Antwerp, aud joined his old patron the earl of Arundel. He settled in that city for a time, and published a considerable number of plates : but his patron going to Italy soon after for the benefit of his health, Hollar fell again in¬ to distress, and was obliged to work for the print and booksellers of Antwerp at very low prices. At the Re¬ storation he returned to England ; where, though he had sufficient employment, the prices he received for his engravings were so greatly inadequate to the la¬ bour necessarily required, that he could but barely sub¬ sist, and the plague, with the succeeding fire of Lon¬ don, putting for some time an effectual stop to business, his affairs were so much embarrassed, that he was never afterwards able to improve his fortune.

In 1642, he was made advocate at Magdeburg, and there applied himself to the study of experimental philosophy. Some time after he travelled into Italy ; and applied himself to the study of medi¬ cine, anatomy, and botany, at Padua. He afterwards studied at Bologna; and at Home learned optics, painting, sculpture, and music. He at length travel¬ led into France, England, and Holland ; obtained the degree of doctor of physic at Wirtemberg ; travelled into Germany and the North ; visited the mines of Saxony, Bohemia, Hungary, and Sweden; and re¬ turned to France, where he acquired the esteem of the learned.

When a young man, in order to improve himself in his favourite study, he corre¬ sponded with the famous Berkeley bishop of Cloyne, Dr Butler bishop of Durham, Dr Samuel Clark, and many othtr ingenious and learned men both in Bri¬ tain and Ireland. The letters of correspondence, we are happy to learn, have been carefully preserved by his son and heir George Home-Drummond, Esq. of Blair-Drummond^ The year 1751 gave birth to the first fruits of his k0[M lordship’s metaphysical studies, under the title of Essays r-- on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion, in two parts. Though a small volume, it was replete with ingenuity and acute reasoning, excited general attention, and gave rise to much controversy. It contained, in more explicit terms than perhaps any other work of a religious theist then known in Scotland, the doctrine which has of late made so much noise under the appel¬ lation of philosophical necessity. The same thing had indeed been taught by Hobbes, by Collins, and by the celebrated David Hume, Esq. hut as those authors either were professed infidels, or were supposed to be such, it excited, as coming from them, no wonder, and provo¬ ked for a time very little indignation. But when a wri¬ ter, who exhibited no symptoms of extravagant scepti¬ cism, who insinuated nothing against the truth of reve¬ lation in general, and who inculcated with earnestness the great duties of morality and natural religion, advan¬ ced at the same time so uncommon a doctiine as that of necessity; a number of pens were immediately drawn against him, and for a while the work and its author were extremely obnoxious to a great part of the Scot¬ tish nation. On the other hand, there were some, and those not totally illiterate, who, confounding necessity with predestination, complimented Mr Home on his ma¬ sterly defence of the established faith : and though be¬ tween these two schemes there is no sort of resemblance, except that the future happiness or misery of all men is, according to both, certainly foreknown and appointed bv God j yet we remember, that a professor in a dissent¬ ing academy so far mistook the one for the other, that he recommended to his pupils the Essays on Morality and Natural Religion, as containing a complete vindi¬ cation of the doctrine of Calvin. For this mistake he was dismissed from his office, and excluded from the communion of the sect to which he belonged. Lord Karnes, like many other great and good men, continued a Necessarian to the day of his death j but in a subse¬ quent edition of the Essays, he exhibited a remarkable proof of his candour and liberality of sentiment, by al¬ tering the expressions, which, contrary to his intention, bad given such general ofl’ence","Berkeley, Durham","US,IE",6,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"

Our limits do not permit us to give details ; but with regard to this book, we must inform the public, that all the intelligent farmers in Scotland uniformly declare, that, after perusing Young, Dickson, and a hundred other writers on agriculture, Lord Karnes’s Gentleman Farmer contains the best practical and rational information on the va¬ rious articles of husbandry which can any where be obtained. As a practical farmer, Lord Karnes has given many obvious proofs of his skill. After he suc¬ ceeded in right of his lady, to the ample estate of Blair-Drummond in the county of Perth, he formed a plan for turning a large moss, consisting of at least 1500 acres, into arable land.

The father and mother dy¬ ing, the young woman was left under the tuition of Cleonax her father’s friend, and sufl'ering herself to be deluded, was got with child. The guardian, though his care had not prevented the misfortune, was how¬ ever willing to conceal it; and therefore sent Critheis to Smyrna, which was then building, 18 years after the founding of Cumae, and about 168 after the taking of Troy. Critheis being near her time, went one day to a festival which the town of Smyrna was celebra¬ ting on the banks of the river Meles; where her pains coming upon her, she was delivered of Homer, whom she called Melesigenes, because he was born on the banks H O M [ 581 ] H O M cr. banks of that river. Having nothing to maintain her, —' she was forced to spin, and a man of Smyrna called Phernias, who taught literature and music, having of¬ ten seen Critheis, who lodged near him, and being pleased with her housewifery, took her into his house to spin the wool he received from his scholars for their schooling. Here she behaved herself so modestly and discreetly, that Phemius married her ; and adopted her son, in whom he discovered a wonderful genius, and the best natural disposition in the world. After the death of Phemius and Critheis, Homer succeeded to his father-in-law’s fortune and school ; and was admi¬ red, not only by the inhabitants of Smyrna, but by strangers, who resorted from all parts to that place of trade. A shipmaster called Menles, who was a man of learning and a lover of poetry, was so taken with Ho¬ mer, that he persuaded him to leave his school, and to travel with him. Homer, who had then begun his poem of the Iliad, and thought it of great consequence to see the places he should have occasion to treat of, em¬ braced the opportunity. He embaiked with Mentes, and during their several voyages never failed carefully to note down all that he thought worth observing. He travelled into Egypt; from whence he brought into Greece the names of their gods, the chief ceremonies of their worship, and a more improved knowledge in the arts than what prevailed in his own country. He visited Africa and Spain ; in his return from whence he touched at Ithaca, where he was much troubled with a rheum falling upon his eyes. Mentes being in haste to take a turn to Leucadia his native country, left Homer well recommended to Mentor, one of the chief men of the island of Ithaca, who took all possible care of him. There Homer was informed of many things relating to Ulysses, which he afterwards made use of in composing his Odyssey. Mentes returning to Ithaca, found Homer cured. They embarked toge¬ ther j and after much time spent in visiting the coasts of Peloponnesus and the islands, they arrived at Colo¬ phon, where Homer was again troubled with the de- fluxion upon his eyes, which proved so violent, that he is said to have lost his sight. This misfortune made him resolve to return to Smyrna, where he finished his Iliad. Some time after, the ill posture of his affairs obliged him to go to Cumae, where he hoped to have found some relief. Here his poems were highly ap¬ plauded : but when he proposed to immortalize their town, if they would allow him a salary, he was answer¬ ed, that “ there would be no end of maintaining all the or blind men and hence got the name of Homer. He afterwards wandered through several places, and stopped at Chios, where he married, and composed his Odyssey. Some time after, having add¬ ed many verses to his poems in praise of the cities of Greece, especially of Athens and Argos, he went to Samos, wdiere he spent the winter, singing at the houses of the great men, with a train of boys after him. From Samos he went to lo, one of the Sporades, with a de¬ sign to continue his voyage to Athens ; but landing by the way at Chios, he fell sick, died, and was buried on the sea shore","Smyrna, Troy, Smyrna, Smyrna, Smyrna, Ho, Ithaca, Mentor, Ithaca, Ithaca, Smyrna, Athens, Athens","US,GR,EG,ES,GH",6,"United States,Greece,Egypt,Spain,Ghana","North America,Europe,Africa,Europe,Africa"

After having examined several curi¬ ous books, he discovered a manuscript copy of the works of Homer, written about the conclusion of the 14th century, but evidently a transcript from a very an¬ cient and most valuable copy, which, besides the Iliad and the Odyssey, contains also 16 of the hymns, which have been long published under the name of Homer",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"The hymn to Ceres appears to be entire, excepting a few lines towards the close : and it is surely remarkable, that a Greek poem, attributed to Homer, which had been lost for ages, should be at length discovered in Muscovy, the rudest and most unclassical country in Europe. M. Matthtei, exulting in an acquisition so unexpected, and at the same time so valuable, commu¬ nicated it, with singular disinterestedness, to his learn¬ ed friend M. Ruhnkenius, with whose talents and ex¬ traordinary erudition he was well acquainted, that this gentleman might present it to the world without those delays which would probably have retarded the publica¬ tion of it at Moscow. He was rather induced to em¬ ploy M. Ruhnkenius in the publication of this curious and beautiful remnant of antiquity, because he knew that this gentleman had been particularly engaged in the study of the hymns of Homer, in order to give the public a complete edition of them. The hymn to Ce¬ res, and the fragment of the hymn to Bacchus, were printed in 1780 at Leyden, under the care of M. Ruhn- kenhis, who has added some very valuable notes and observations on the hymn to Ceres, which tend to illus¬ trate its beauties, and to throw a light on some of its obscurities. The learned editor observes, that nothing was more distant from his expectations than the disco¬ very of this hymn to Ceres. He knew indeed that a poem bearing that title, and ascribed to Homer, existed in the second century ; but as it had long been consi¬ dered as irretrievably lost, he had formed no hopes of ever seeing it rescued from the obscurity to which it had been consigned. He acknowledges, that he has many doubts with respect to the high and illustrious origin ascribed to this hymn : but as no positive external evi¬ dence can be produced to determine the point, he chooses to rest his argument on what appears to him the more certain ground of internal proof •, and observes, that though the poem be exquisitely beautiful, yet that it is evidently deficient in some of Homer’s more strik¬ ing and predominant characteristics. It wants his ener¬ gy and spirit; that vigour, that inspiration, which ani¬ mate and give an irresistible power, as well as an en¬ chanting beauty, to the poems of that sublime and ini¬ mitable bard. This opinion, as we have already seen, hath been given by other critics of all the hymns of 3 Homer. But though M. Ruhnkenius is not inclined to attribute to Homer the hymn to Ceres, he yet ac¬ knowledges, that the structure of its language is found- Hwmcidt","Ceres, Moscow, Ceres, Ceres, Ceres","ZA,US,GR",6,"South Africa,United States,Greece","Africa,North America,Europe"

He is of opinion, that it was written immediately after Homer, or at least in the age ef Hesiod } and he congratulates the age on the discovery of so curious a poem, rescued by mere accident from the darkest retreats of oblivion, and perhaps but at a slight distance from inevitable per¬ dition. He deems it to be an acquisition, not only cal¬ culated to gratify the curiosity of the connoisseurs in classic antiquity, or to entertain those lovers of Greek poetry whose studies are made subservient to a refined and elegant species of amusement, but he also esteems it to be of particular use to the critic, as it tends to il¬ lustrate some obscure passages both in the Greek and Latin poets",,GR,6,Greece,Europe
"At Athens, if any theft was committed by night, it was lawful to kill the criminal, if taken in the fact : and, by the Roman law of the twelve tables, a thief might be killed by night with impunity ; or even by day, if he armed himself with any dangerous weapon : which amounts very nearly to the same as is permitted by our own constitutions",Roman,RO,6,Romania,Europe
"1. Homicide per infortunium, or misadventure, is where a man, doing a lawful act, without any inten¬ tion of hurt, unfortunately kills another; as vvhere a man is at work with a hatchet, and the head thereof flies off and kills a stander-by; or where a person, qua¬ lified to keep a gun, is shooting at a mark, and unde- signedly kills a man : for the act is lawful, and the ef¬ fect is merely accidental. So where a parent is mode¬ rately correcting his child, a master his apprentice or scholar, or an officer punishing a criminal, and happens to occasion his death, it is only misadventure; for the act of correction was lawful : but if he exceeds the bounds of moderation, either in the manner, the instru¬ ment, or the quantity of punishment, and death ensues, it is manslaughter at least, and in some cases (accord¬ ing to the circumstances) murder ; for the act,of immo¬ derate correction is unlawful.

"Even the slaughter of enemies required a solemn pur¬ gation among the Jews; which implies, that the death of a man, however it happens, will leave some stain behind it. And the Mosaical law appointed certain cities of refuge for him “ who killed his neighbour un¬ awares ; as if a man goetli into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the ax to cut down a tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die, lie shall flee into one of those cities and live.” But it seems he was not held wholly blameless, any more than iu the English law; since the avenger of blood might slay him before he reached his asylum, or if he afterwards stirred out of it till the death of the high priest. In the imperial law likewise casual homi¬ cide was excused, by the indulgence of the emperor signed with his own sign manual, adnotatione princi- pis ; otherwise, the death of a man, however commit- tod, was in some degree punishable. Among the Greeks, homicide by misfortune was expiated by vo¬ luntary banishment for a year. In Saxony, a fine is paid to the kindred of the slain ; which also, among the western Goths, was little inferior to that of voluntary homicide : and in France, no person is ever absolved in cases of this nature, without a largess to the poor, and the charge of certain masses for the soul of the party killed",,"FR,UK",6,"France,N/A","Europe,N/A"

It seems rather to have consist¬ ed in a forfeiture, some say of all the goods and chat¬ tels, others of only a part of them, by way of fine or weregild: which was probably disposed of, as in France, in pios usus, according to the humane super¬ stition of the times, for the benefit of his soul who was thus suddenly sent to his account with all his im¬ perfections on his head : But that reason having long ceased, and the penalty (especially if a total forfei¬ ture) growing more severe than was intended, in pro¬ portion as personal property has become more consider¬ able, the delinquent has now, and has had as early as our records will reach, a pardon and writ of restitution of his goods as a matter of course and right, only pay¬ ing for suing out the same. And, indeed, to prevent this expence, in cases where the death has notoriously happened by misadventure or in self desence, the judges will usually permit (if not direct) a general verdict of acquittal",,FR,6,France,Europe

"After his father’s death, which happened in 1653, he received some instructions from his uncle John Bap¬ tist Weeninx ; but his principal and best instructor was nature, which he studied with intense application.— His pencil was wonderfully neat and delicate; bus touch light; his colouring exceedingly natural, lively, and remarkably transparent; and the feathers of his fowls were expressed with such a swelling softness, as might have readily and agreeably deceived the eye of any spectator* w HON [ 587 ] HON toot- spectator. It is reported that he had trained up a cock to stand in any attitude he wanted to describe, and that it was his custom to place that creature near Ejr' his easel; so that at the motion of his hand the bird would fix itself in the proper posture, and would con¬ tinue in that particular position without the smallest perceptible alteration for several hours at a time.

"HONEY, a sweet vegetable juice, collected by the bees from the flowers of various plants, and deposited in the cells of the comb •, from which it is extracted either by spontaneous percolation through a sieve in a warm place, the comb being separated and laid there¬ on, or by expression. That which runs spontaneously is purer than that which is expressed, a quantity of the wax and other matters being forced out along with it by the pressure. The best sort of honey is of a thick consistence, a whitish colour inclining to yellow, an agreeable smell, and pleasant taste : both the colour and flavour are said to differ in some degree, accord¬ ing to the plants which the bees collect it from. It is supposed thaj: honey is merely the juice of the flower perspiring, and becoming inspissated thereon, and that the bee takes it up with its proboscis, and carries it to be deposited in its waxen cells, with which the young bees are to be fed in summer, and the old ones in winter-, but it is certain, that honey can be pro¬ cured by no other method of collecting this juice than by the bees. The honey wrought by the young bees, and that which is permitted to run from the comb without heat or pressure, is white and pure, and called virgin honey. The honey of old bees, and that which is forced from the comb by heat or pressure, is yellow, from the wax. Honey produced where the air is clear and hot, is better than that where the air is variable and cold.—The honey of Narbonne in France, where rosemary abounds, is said to have a very manifest flavour of that plant, and to be imitable by adding to other honey an infusion of rosemary flowers",Narbonne,FR,6,France,Europe
"Honey, considered as a medicine, is a very useful detergent and aperient, powerfully dissolving viscid juices, and promoting the expectoration of tough phlegm. In some particular constitutions it has an inconvenience of griping, or of proving purgative, which is said to be in some measure prevented by pre¬ viously boiling the honey. This, however, with all constitutions, is by no means effectual ; and the cir¬ cumstance mentioned has had so much weight with the Edinburgh college, that they do not now employ it in any preparation, and have entirely rejected the mella medicata, substituting syrups in their place : but there can be no doubt that honey is very useful in gi¬ ving form to different articles, although there be some individuals with whom it may disagree. In order, however, to obtain the good effects of the honey it¬ self, it must be used to a considerable extent, and as an article of diet. The following remarkable instances of the good effects of honey in some asthmatio cases, given by Mr Monro in his Medical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, deserve to be here inserted. “ The late Dr John Hume, one of the commissioners of the sick and hurt of the royal navy, was for many years vio¬ lently afflicted with the asthma. Having taken many medicines without receiving relief, he at last resolved to try the effects of honey, having long had a great opinion of its virtues as a pectoral. For two or three years he ate some ounces of it daily, and got entirely free of his asthma, and likewise of a gravelly complaint with which he had long been afflicted. About two years after he had recovered his health, when he was sitting one day in the office for the sick and hurt, a person labouring under a great difficulty of breathing, who looked as if he could not live many days, came to him, and asked him by what means he had been cured of his asthma ? Dr Hume told him the particulars of his own case, and mentioned to him the means by which he had found relief. For two years after he heard nothing of this person, who was a stranger to him, and had seemed so bad that he did not imagine he could have lived many days, and therefore had not even asked him who he was*, but at the end of that period, a man seemingly in good health, and de¬ cently dressed, came to the sick and hurt office, and returned him thanks for his cure, which he assured him had been entirely brought about by the free use of honey.” Honey Deiv, a sweet saccharine substance found on the leaves of certain trees, of which bees are very fond, by the husbandmen supposed to fall from the heavens like common dew. This opinion hath been refuted, and the true origin of this and other saccha¬ rine dews shown by the Abbe Boissier de Sauvages, in a memoir read before the Society of Sciences at Mont¬ pelier. “ Chance (says the abbe) afforded me an op¬ portunity of seeing this juice in its primitive form on the leaves of the holm oak : these leaves were covered with thousands of small round globules or drops, which, without touching one another, seemed to point out the pore from whence each of them had proceed¬ ed.

"His pursuers soon lost sight of him, for he had unper* ceived thrown himself over a garden wall. The owner, a Moor, happening to be in his garden, was addressed by the Spaniard on his knees, who acquainted him with his case, and implored concealment. “ Eat this,” said the Moor (giving him half a peach), “ you now know that you may confide in my protection.” He then locked him up in his garden apartment, telling him as soon as it was night he would provide for his escape to a place of greater safety. The Moor then went into his house, where he had but just seated himself, when a great crowd, with loud lamentations, came to his gate, bringing the corpse of his son, who had just been killed by a Spaniard. When the first shock of surprise was a little over, he learnt from the descrip¬ tion given, that the fatal deed was done by the very person then in his power. He mentioned this to no one ; but as soon as it was dark retired to his garden, as if to grieve alone, giving orders that none should follow him. Then accosting the Spaniard, he said, “ Christian, the person you have killed is my son ; his body is now in my house. You ought to softer ; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my faith, which must not be broken.” He then led the astonished Spaniard to his stables, mounted him on one of his fleetest horses, and said, “ Fly far while the night can cover you ; you will be safe in the morn¬ ing. You are indeed guilty of my son’s blood : but God is just and good ; and I thank him I am innocent of yours, and that my faith given is preserved.” This point of honour is most religiously observed by the Arabs and Saracens, from whom it was adopted by the Moors of Africa, and by them wms brought into Spain. The following instance of Spanish honour may still dwell in the memory of many living, and de¬ serves to be handed down to the latest posterity. In the year 1746, when we were in hot war with Spain, the Elizabeth of London, Captain William Edwards, co¬ ming through the gulf from Jamaica, richly laden, met with a most violent storm, in which the ship sprung a leak, that obliged them, for the saving of their lives, to run into the Havannah, a Spanish port.

A certain mauvmse ' honte hindered me at that time from giving a direct answer. The truth is, my lord, I cannot be said at present to be in any form of life, but rather to live extempore. The late epidemical distemper seized me, I endeavoured to be rich, imagined for a while that I was, and am in some measure happy to find myself at this instant but just worth nothing. If your lordship, or any of your numerous friends, have need of a ser¬ vant with the bare qualifications of being able to read and write, and to be honest, I shall gladly undertake any employments your lordship shall not think me unworthy of. I have been taught, my lord, that nei¬ ther a man’s natural pride, nor his self-love, is unequal judge of what is fit for him ; and I shall endeavour to remember, that it is not the short part we act, but the manner of our performance, which gains or loses us the applause of Him who is finally to decide of all human actions. My lord, I am just now employed in trans¬ lating from the French, a History of the Life of the late Archbishop of Cambray ; and I was thinking to beg the honour of your lordship’s name to protect a work which will have so much need of it. The ori¬ ginal is not yet published. ’Tis written by the author of the Discourse upon F.pic Poetry, in the new edi¬ tion of Telemaque. As there are some passages in the book of a particular nature, I dare not solicit your lordship to grant me the favour I have mentioned, till yon first have perused it. The whole is short, aud pretty fairly transcribed. If your lordship could find a spare hour to look it over, I would wait upon your lordship with it, as it may possibly be no unpleasing entertainment. I should humbly ask your lordship s pardon for so long an address in a season of so much business. But when should I be able to find » time in which your lordship’s goodness is not employed ? l am with perfect respect and duty, my lord, your lordship’s most obliged, most faithful, and most obedient humble servant, Nathaniel Hooke.” The translation here spoken of was afterwards printed in l2mo, From this period till his death, Mr Hooke enjoyed the con¬ fidence and patronage of men not less distinguished by virtue than by titles.

In October, in the same year, he was lor some trivial misdemeanor expelled the college, but was immediately restored. In 1581 he took orders j and, being appointed to preach at St Paul’s cross, he came to London, where he was unfortunately drawn into a marriage with Joan Churchman, the termagant daugh¬ ter of his hostess. Having thus lost his fellowship, he continued in the utmost distress till the year 15^4* when he was presented by John Cheny, Esq. to the rectory of Drayton-Beaucham in Buckinghamshire. In this retirement he was visited by Mr Edwin Sandys, and Mr George Cranmer, his former pupils. They found him, with a Horace in his hand, tending some sheep in the common field, his servant having been or¬ dered home by his sweet Xantippe. They attended him to his house j but were soon deprived of his company by an order, from his wife Joan, for him to come and rock the cradle. Mr Sandys’s representation to his father, of his tutor’s situation, procured him the mas¬ tership of the Temple. In this situation he met with considerable molestation from one Travers, lec¬ turer of the Temple, and a bigotted Puritan, who in the afternoon endeavoured to confute the doctrine de¬ livered in the morning. From this disagreeable situa¬ tion he solicited Archbishop Whitgift to remove him to some country retirement, where he might prosecute his studies in tranquillity. Accordingly in 1591, he obtained the rectory of Boscomb in Wiltshire, toge¬ ther with a prebend in the church of Salisbury, of which he was also made sub-dean.

In the reign of Edward II. they complained to parlia¬ ment, that by foreigners buying up the horns in Eng¬ land, they were in danger of being ruined, and this business lost to the nation. For this reason was made the statute 6 Edw. IV. by which the sale of horns to foreigners (except such as the said horners refused) was prohibited ; and the wardens had power granted them to search all the markets in London, and twenty-four miles round, and to inspect Sturbridge and Ely fairs, to prevent such practices, and to purchase horns at sta¬ ted prices. But on plausible pretences this law was re¬ pealed in the reign of James I. and thereupon the old evil revived. The horners again applied to parlia¬ ment, and King Edward’s statute was renewed (except¬ ing as to the inspection of the fairs), and still remains in force. The importation of unwrought horns into this country is also prohibited. In 1750, there were exported to Holland 514,500 lantern leaves, besides powder flasks. There was formerly a duty of 20 shil¬ lings a thousand, under which in 1682 were exported 76,650 ; but in the reign of George I. this duty was taken off, and these and all other manufactures made of horns may be exported free.

"Hospital, Wilham-Francis-Antony, Marquis of, a great mathematician of France, was horn of an ancient family in 1661. He was a geometrician almost from his infancy; for one day being at the duke of Rohan’s, where some able mathematicians were speaking of a problem of Paschal’s which appeared to them extreme¬ ly difficult, he ventured to say, that he believed he could solve it. They were amazed at such presump¬ tion in a boy of 15, for he was then no more; never¬ theless, in a few days he sent them the solution. He entered early into the army, and was a captain of horse ; but being extremely short-sighted, and exposed on that account to perpetual inconveniences and errors, he at length quitted the army, and applied himself en- , tirely to his favourite amusement. He contracted a friendship for Malebranche, and took his opinion upon all occasions. In 1693, he was received an honorary member of the academy of sciences at Paris ; and he published a work upon Sir Isaac Newton’s calculations, entitled, VAnalyse des wfinimens petits. He was the first in France who wrote upon this subject; and on this account was regarded almost as a prodigy. He engaged afterwards in another work of the mathemati¬ cal kind, in which he included Les Sections Coniques, les Lieux Geometriques, la Construction des Equations, ct Une Theorie des Courbes Mechaniques: but a little before he had finished it, he was seized with a fever, of which he died Feb. 2. 1704, aged 43.

"The laws of the Salvi ordained that the moveables of an inhospitable person should be confiscated, and his house burnt. They were even so solicitous for the en¬ tertainment of strangers, that they permitted the land¬ lord to steal for the support of his guest.” The hospitality of our British ancestors, particularly of the great and opulent barons, hath been much ad¬ mired, H O S [ 629 ] H O S » italiiy, mired, and considered as a certain proof of the noble- Z y—~J ness and generosity of their spirits. The fact is well attested. The castles of the powerful barons were ca¬ pacious palaces, daily crowded with their numerous retainers, who were always welcome to their plentiful tables. They had their privy counsellors, their trea¬ surers, marshals, constables, stewards, secretaries, chap¬ lains, heralds, pursuivants, pages, henshmen or guards, trumpeters, minstrels, and in a word all the officers of a royal court. The etiquette of their families was an exact copy of that of the royal household ; and some of them lived in a degree of pomp and splendour little inferior to that of the greatest kings. Richard Ne¬ ville, earl of Warwick, we are told, “ was ever had in great favour of the commons of the land, because of the exceeding household which he daily kept in all countries wherever he sojourned or lay : and when he came to London, he held such an house, that six oxen were eaten at a breakfast; and every tavern was full of his meat.” The earls of Douglas in Scotland, before the fall of that great family, rivalled or rather exceed¬ ed their sovereigns in pomp and profuse hospitality. But to this manner ot living it is highly probable these great chieftains were prompted by a desire of increa¬ sing the number and attachment of their retainers, on which, in those turbulent times, their dignity, and even their safety, depended, as much as to the innate generosity of their tempers. Those retainers did not constantly reside in the lamilies of their lords ; but they wore their liveries and badges, frequently feasted in their halls, swelled their retinues on all great solem¬ nities, attended them in their journeys, and followed them into the field of battle. Some powerful chief¬ tains had so great a number of these retainers constant¬ ly at their command, that they set the laws at defiance, were formidable to their sovereigns, and terrible to their fellow-subjects j and several laws were made against giving and receiving liveries. But these laws produced little effect in this period","Warwick, London, Douglas","US,GB",6,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

"The Europeans first became acquainted with this country in the year 1493, when Bartholomew Diaz, a Portuguese admiral, discovered the most southerly point of Africa, now called the Cape of Good Hope, but by him Cabos dos totos tormentos, or Cape of all Plagues, on account of the storms he met with in the neighbourhood; but John, then king of Portugal, ha¬ ving from the account of Diaz concluded that a pas¬ sage to the East Indies was now discovered, changed the name to that of the Cape of Good Hope, which it still retains. In 1497* was circumnavigated by Vasco de Gama, who made a voyage to India that way ; however, it remained useless to Europeans till the year 1650, when Van Riebeck a Dutch surgeon first saw the advantages that would accrue to the East India company in Holland from a settlement at such a convenient distance both from home and from India",Holland,"IN,PT,US,NL",6,"India,Portugal,United States,Netherlands","Asia,Europe,North America,Europe"

"The coast abounds in capes, bays, and roads. Thir¬ ty leagues to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, in S. Lat. 34. 21. is another cape which runs out be- yond 350, called by the Portuguese, who first doubled it, Cabo dos Agulhas, or the Cape of Needles, on ac¬ count of some strange variations in the magnetical needle observed as they came near it. Near this cape is a flat shore, with plenty of fish : it begins in the west near a fresh-water river, and, extending 15 leagues in the main sea, ends in the east near Fish-bay. Cabo Falso, so called by the Portuguese, who returning from India mistook it for the Cape of Good Hope, lies to the eastward between these two capes, about eight or time leagues beyond that of Good Hope. Along the coasts, on both sides of the Cape of Good Hope, are many fine bays. Twenty-seven leagues to the north¬ west is Saldanha bay, so named from a Portuguese cap¬ tain shipwrecked on the coast. The largest and most commodious is Table Bay, on the south, and near the mountain of that name, six leagues in circumference, with four fathoms water close to the beach. Opposite to this bay is Bobu Eilan, or the island of Rabbits in 34. 30. S. Lat. 67 leagues east from the Cape of Good Hope. Peter Both, in 1661, discovered a bay, which he named Uleest, sheltered only from north winds, in which is a small island, and on the west a rivulet of fresh water extremely convenient for European mariners","Cabo, Along, Saldanha","PT,IN,BR,ZA",6,"Portugal,India,Brazil,South Africa","Europe,Asia,South America,Africa"

"Most accounts of this country that have been pub¬ lished mention a surprising phenomenon which is an¬ nually to be seen on the top of Table-hill from Sep¬ tember to March ; namely, a white cloud hovering on its top, and called by sailors the Devil's table-cloth. (See the article GooD-Hope'). This cloud is said by some to appear at first no bigger than a barley-corn ; then increases to the size of a walnut, and soon after co¬ vers the whole top of the mount. But, according to Mr Kolben, it is never less, even on its first appear¬ ance, than the size of a large ox, often bigger. It bangs in several fleeces over the Table-hill and the Wind or Devil’s-hill ; which fleeces, at last uniting, form a large cloud that covers the summits of these two hills. After this has rested for some time with¬ out change or motion, the wind bursts out suddenly from it with the utmost fury. The skirts of the cloud are white, but seem much more compact than the mat¬ ter of common clouds j the upper parts are of a leaden colour. No rain falls from it, but sometimes it dis¬ covers a great deal of humidity j at which times it is of a darker colour, and the wind issuing from it is broken, raging by fits of short continuance. In its usual state, the wind keeps up its first fury unabated for one, two, three, or eight days ; and sometimes for a whole month together. The cloud seems all the while undiminished, though little fleeces are from time to time detached, from it, and hurried down the sides of the hills, vanish¬ ing when they reach the bottom, so that during the stoim the cloud seems to be supplied with new matter","Most, March","CZ,GB",6,"Czechia,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"The first begins with our spring in March j the latter with September, when our summer ends. In the sum¬ mer monsoon reign the south-east winds already men¬ tioned j which though they clear and render the air more healthy, yet make it difficult for ships outward bound to enter Table-bay. In the bad season, the Cape is much subject to fogs $ and the north-west winds and rain make the inhabitants stay much at home. But there are frequent intermissions and many clear days till June and July j when it rains almost con¬ tinually, and from thence till summer. The weather in winter is cold, raw and unpleasant j but never more rigorous than autumn in Germany. Water ne¬ ver freezes to above the thickness of half a crown j and as soon as the sun appears the ice is dissolved. The Cape is rarely visited with thunder and lightning, ex¬ cepting a little near the turn of the seasons, which ne¬ ver does any hurt. During the continuance of the south-east winds which rage in summer, the sky is free of all clouds except that on the Table and Wind Hills, already mentioned j but during the north-west winds, the air is thick, and loaded with heavy clouds big with rain. If the south-east winds should cease for any length of time, the air becomes sickly by reason of the sea weeds driving ashore and rotting hence the Eu¬ ropeans are at such times affected with headachs and other disorders : but, on the other hand, the violence of those winds subjects them to inflammation of their eyes, &c",March,"DE,GB",6,"Germany,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"A general opinion has prevailed, that the Hottentot women have a kind of natural veil which covers the sexual parts ; but this is denied by our author. “ The women (says he) have no parts uncommon to the rest of their sex : but the clitoris and nymphse, particularly of those who are past their youth, are pretty much elon¬ gated , a peculiarity which has undoubtedly got foot¬ ing in this nation in consequence of the relaxation ne¬ cessarily produced by the method they have of besmear¬ ing their bodies, their slothfulness, and the warmth of the climate.” The Hottentots besmear all their bodies copiously with fat mixed up with a little soot. “ This (says our author) is never wiped off j on the contrary, I ne¬ ver saw them use any thing to clean their skins, ex¬ cepting that when in greasing the wheels of their wag¬ gons their hands were besmeared with tar and pitch, they used to get it off very easily with cow-dung, at the same time rubbing their arms into the bargain up to the shoulders with this cosmetic •, so that as the dust and other filth, together with their sooty ointment, and the sweat of their bodies, must necessarily, not¬ withstanding it is continually wearing off, in some mea¬ sure adhere to the skin, it contributes not a little to conceal the natural hue of the latter, and at the same time to change it from a bright umber-brown to a brownish yellow colour, obscured with filth and na¬ stiness.”—The doctor was enabled to discover the na¬ tural colour of the Hottentots by means of the nicety •f some Dutch farmers wives, who had made their Hottentot girls wash and scour their skins, that tbev Vol. X. Part II. f might be less filthy in looking after the children, or Hotteatois",,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"By the ointment of soot and grease stuck full of the powder of bucku, a paste is formed which defends the bodies ol the Hottentots in a great measure from the action of the air; so that they require very few clothes, and in fact go almost quite naked. The only cover¬ ing of the men consists of two leather straps, which generally hang down the back from the chine to the thighs, each of them in the form of an isosceles tri¬ angle, their points uppermost, and fastened to a belt which goes round their waist, their bases not being above three fingers broad ; so that the covering they form is extremely trifling. These straps have very little dressing bestowed upon them, so that they make a rat¬ tling noise as the Hottentot runs along ; and our author supposes that they may produce an agreeable coolness by fanning him. Besides this, the men have a bag or flap made of skin which hangs down before, and is fastened to the belt already mentioned. The hollow part of this seems designed to receive that which with us modesty requires to be concealed ; hut being only fastened by a small part of its upper end to a narrow belt, in other respects hanging quite loose, it is but a very imperfect concealment; and when the wearer is walking, or otherwise in motion, it is none at all. They call this purse by the Dutch name of jackall, it being almost always prepared of the skin of that animal, with the hairy side turned outwards",,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"Sometimes they are made of pieces of leather forming one entire ring ; so that the arms and feet must be put through them when the wearer wishes to put them on. They are strung upon the legs, small and great, without any nicety ; but are so large, that they shake and get twisted when the person walks. Kings of iron or copper, hut especially ol brass, of the size of a goose-quill, are considered as more genteel than those of leather. However, they are sometimes worn along with the latter, to the number of six or eight at a time, particularly on the arms. The girls are not allowed to use any rings till they are marriageable. The Hot¬ tentots seldom wear any shoes ; but such as they do make use of are of the same form with those worn by the African peasants, by the Esthonians, and Livo¬ nians, as well as by some Finlanders ; so that it is impossible to say whether they are the invention of the Dutch or the Hottentots themselves. They are made of undressed leather, with the hairy side outward ; with¬ out any other preparation than that of being beat and moistened. If it be a thick and stout hide, as that of a buffalo, it is kept for some hours in cow- dung, which renders it besides very soft and pliable",,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"There is a genus of insects (the mantis) which, it has been generally thought, the Hottentots worship; but our author is so far from being of this opinion, that he tells us they have more than once eatched se¬ veral of them for him, and assisted him in sticking pins through them as he did through other insects. “ There is (says he), however, a diminutive species of this in¬ sect, which some think it would be a crime, as well as very dangerous to do any harm to: but this we have no more reason to look upon as any kind of reli¬ gious worship, than we have to consider in the same light a certain superstitious notion prevalent among many of the more simple people in our own country (Sweden), who imagine that their sins will be forgiven them, if they set a cock-chafer on its feet that has happened to fall upon its back. The moon, according to Kolbe, receives a kind of adoration from the Hot¬ tentots ; but the fact is, that they merely take the op¬ portunity of her beams, and at the same time of the coolness of the night, to amuse themselves with dan¬ cing, and consequently have no more thoughts of wor¬ shipping her than the Christian colonists who are seen at that time strolling in great numbers about the streets, and parading on the stone steps with which their houses are usually encircled. The conjurers themselves, ac¬ cording to our author, are generally freethinkers, who have neither religion nor superstition of any kind",,SE,6,Sweden,Europe
"Of the Dutch settlements and policy at the Cape, Mr Forster gives the following account",Of,"TR,NL",6,"Turkey,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"] HOT The deputy-governor has the direction of the com¬ pany’s whole commerce here, and signs all orders to the different departments under him, as well as the governor to others. He and the fiscal have the rank of upper koopman. The fiscal is at the head of the po¬ lice, and sees the penal laws put in execution : his in¬ come consists of fines, and of the duties laid on cer¬ tain articles of commerce ; but if he be strict in exact¬ ing them, he is universally detested. The sound policy oi the Dutch has likewise found it necessary to place the fiscal as a check, to overawe the other officers of the company, that they may not counteract the inte¬ rests of their masters, or infringe the laws of the mo¬ ther-country. He is, to that end, commonly well versed in juridical affairs, and depends solely upon the mother-country. The major (at present Mr Von Prehn, who received us with great politeness) has the rank of koopman or merchant: this circumstance sur¬ prises a stranger, who, in all other European states, is used to see military honours confer distinction and pre¬ cedence; and appears still more singular to one who knows the contrast in this particular between Holland and Russia, where the idea of military rank is annexed to every, place, even that of a professor at the univer¬ sity. The number of regular soldiers at this colony amounts to about 700, of which 400 form the gar¬ rison of the fort, near the Cape-town. The inhabi¬ tants capable of bearing arms form a militia of 4000 men, of whom a considerable part may he assembled in a few hours, by means of signals made from alarm- places in different parts of the country. We may from hence make some estimate of the number of white people in this colony, which is at present so extensive, that the distant settlements are above a month’s jour¬ ney from the Cape : but these remote parts lie some¬ times more than a day’s journey from each other, are surrounded by various nations of Hottentots, and too frequently feel the want of protection from their own government at that distance. The slaves in this colony are at least in the proportion of five or more to one white person. The principal inhabitants at the Cape have sometimes from 20 to 30 slaves, who are in ge¬ neral treated with great lenity, and sometimes become great favourites with their masters, who give them ver y good clothing, but oblige them to wear neither shoes nor stockings, reserving these articles to themselves",Holland,"RU,US,NL",6,"Russian Federation,United States,Netherlands","Europe,North America,Europe"

There are, however, among the principal inhabitants, persons of both sexes, whose whole deportment, extensive reading, and well-culti¬ vated understanding, would be admired and distinguish¬ ed even in Europe. Their circumstances are in gene¬ ral easy, and very often affluent, on account of the cheap rate at which the necessaries of life are to be pro¬ cured : but they seldom amass such prodigious riches here as at Batavia j and I was told the greatest private fortune at the Cape did not exceed 100,000 dollars, or about 25,000!. sterling",Batavia,"US,FR,PT",6,"United States,France,Portugal","North America,Europe,Europe"
"“ Though the Dutch company seem evidently to discourage all new settlers, by granting no lands in piivate property j yet the products of the country 5 have of late years sufficed not only to supply the isles of Hottentots iiiiii? France and Bourbon with corn, but likewise to furnish HoUinger.ffr’ the mother-country with several ship loads. These ex- ports would certainly be made at an easier rate than at present, if the settlements did not extend so far into the country, from whence the products must be brought to the Table-bay by land-carriage, on roads which are al¬ most impassable. The intermediate spaces of unculti¬ vated land between the different settlements are very extensive, and contain many spots fit for agriculture; but one of the chief reasons why the colonists are so much divided and scattered throughout the country, is to he met with in another regulation of the company, which forbids every new settler to establish himself with¬ in a mile of another. It is evident, that if this settle¬ ment were in the hands of the commonwealth, it would have attained to a great population, and a degree of opulence and splendour of which it has not the least hopes at present; but a private company of East India merchants find their account much better in keeping all the landed property to themselves, and tying down the colonist, lest he should become too great and power¬ ful",,"FR,NL",6,"France,Netherlands","Europe,Europe"

Several other sorts grow in the neighbourhood of that plantation, which produce a sweet rich wine, that generally passes for genuine Con¬ stantia in Europe.

An ex¬ cellent dry wine, which has a slight agreeable tartness, is commonly drank in the principal families, and is made of Madeira vines transplanted to the Cape. Se¬ veral low sorts, not entirely disagreeable, are raised in great plenty, and sold at a very cheap rate ; so that the sailors of the East India ships commonly indulge themselves very plentifully in them whenever they come ashore",Shiraz,"IR,FR",6,"Iran, Islamic Republic of,France","Asia,Europe"

He discovered an invincible propensity to learning at a very early period, and acquired the knowledge of languages with astonishing facility. The trustees of the schools had their attention attracted towards Hottinger by his amazing progress in the knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, whom they determined to send to foreign universities at the public expence. In 1638 he studied for a short time at Geneva under the cele¬ brated Spanheim, and went afterwards to France. He next visited Holland and Flanders, and became a stu¬ dent HOT [ 639 ] H O U }k nger. <3ent in the university of Groningen, where he attended ' the theological lectures of the renowned Francis Gomar, and Professor Alting, and studied the Arabic language tinder Professor Pasor. Being anxious, however, to en¬ joy still more advantages than this situation afforded, he went to Leyden, where he became tutor to the chil¬ dren of Professor Golius, whose knowledge of oriental languages was at that time unrivalled. By his instruc¬ tions and those of a Turk then at Leyden, Hottinger’s knowledge of the Arabic became very extensive, and Golius allowed him to copy many of the Arabic ma¬ nuscripts which he had in his possession. In 1641 he was chosen chaplain to the embassy of the states-general to Constantinople j but the magistrates of Zurich would not allow him to accept of it, resolving that his talents should be exerted for the glory and benefit of their own public schools. They permitted him to visit Eng¬ land prior to his return home, where he contracted ha¬ bits of intimacy with some of the most distinguished li¬ terary characters. As soon as he returned to Zurich, he was appointed professor of church-history, when no more than 22 years of age ; and when 23, he was cho¬ sen professor of catechetical divinity and oriental lan¬ guages. About this period he married, and began his career as an author, in which he persevered for twenty years, with the most astonishing industry. In 1653 he was appointed professor of rhetoric, and professor ex¬ traordinary of the divinity of the Old Testament, and controversial theology","Geneva, Holland, Groningen","US,FR,NL,GR,TR",6,"United States,France,Netherlands,Greece,Turkey","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia"
"So justly celebrated about this time was Hottinger as a man of uncommon erudition, that his aid was earnest¬ ly requested by the elector palatine, to restore the fame of the university of Heidelberg. The magistrates of Zurich consented to lend him for three years. At Hei¬ delberg he was made professor of divinity, principal, ecclesiastical counsellor, and rector. He wrote in fa¬ vour of the re-union of Lutherans and Calvinists ; but he had no better success than all his predecessors in the same attempt. He continued at Heidelberg, by per¬ mission of the magistrates of Zurich, till 1661. On his return home, he was chosen president of the com¬ missioners who were appointed to revise the German translation of the Bible. He was requested to accept of professorships from the magistrates of Deventer, the landgrave of Hesse, and the magistrates of Amsterdam and Bremen j but the love of his country made him re¬ fect the whole. He was offered the divinity chair at Leyden in 1667, but the magistrates would not part with him.

"The months of January, February, and March, are the best for breeding; late puppies seldom thrive.

Some- times these animals will have an extraordinary number _ of whelps. Mr Beckford informs us, that he has known a bitch have 15 puppies at a litter; and he assures us, that a friend of his informed him, that a hound in his pack brought forth 16, all of them alive. In these cases it is proper to put some of the puppies to another bitch, if you want to keep them all; but if any are de¬ stroyed, the best coloured ought to be kept. The bitches should not only have plenty of flesh, but milk also ; and the puppies should not be taken from them till they are able to take care of themselves ; their mo¬ thers will be relieved when they learn to lap milk, which they will do in a short time. After the puppies are taken away from the mothers, the litter should have three purging balls given them, one every other morn¬ ing, and plenty of whey the intermediate day. If a bitch bring only one or two puppies, and you have an¬ other that will take them, by putting the puppies to her the former will soon be fit to hunt again.

Wood says, from tradition, that he was some time a student at Cardinal College, Oxford. In his youth he became enamoured of the Fair Geraldine, whom his sonnets have immortalized. In 1532, Howard with his companion Richmond was at Paris, where they continued some time. The latter died in 1536; after which our young hero made a tour to Italy, and at Florence, like a true enamorato, published a challenge against all comers, whether Christians, Jews, Saracens, Turks, or cannibals, in defence of the beau¬ ty of his fair Geraldine ; and was victorious in the tournament instituted by the grand duke on the occa- s on. The duke, we* are told, was so charmed with his gallant exploits, that he would gladly have retained him at his court j but be rejected tiie invitation, being determined to maintain the superlative beauty of his Geraldine in all the principal cities in Italy.

In January 1573, he succeeded his father in his title and estate ; after which he successively became chamberlain of the household and knight of the Garter, and in 1585 was made lord high admiral, at that critical juncture when the Spaniards were sending their Armada, in their opi¬ nion, to the assured conquest of this kingdom. When he received intelligence of the approach of the Spanish fleet, and saw the prodigious consequence it was to get out the few ships that were ready at Plymouth, he not only gave orders in every thing himself, but wrought also with his own hands, and the first night left the port with six ships. The next morning, though he had only 30 sail, and those the smallest of the fleet, he attacked the Spanish navy; but first dispatched his brother-in-law, Sir Edward Hobby, to the queen, to desire her to make the proper disposition of her land- forces for the security of the coast, and to hasten as many ships as possible to his assistance.

"But providence remarkably interposed to preserve so valuable a life, by inclining him that morning to go on horseback a different road.” But the sphere in which he had hitherto moved was too narrow for bis enlarged mind. Being named in 1773 to the office of sheriff of Bedfordshire, from that time his scene of usefulness was extended. His effice, as he himself observes, brought the distress of prisoners more immediately under his notice. A tense of duty induced him personally to visit the county-jail, where he observed such abuses and such scenes of calamity, as he had before no conception ofj end he soon exerted himself in order to a reform. With a view to obtain precedents for certain regulations which he proposed, he went to inspect the prisons in some neighbouring counties. But finding in them equal room for complaint and commiseration, be determined to visit the principal prisons in England. The farther be proceeded, the more shocking were the scenes pre¬ sented to his view: which induced him to resolve upon exerting himself to the utmost, in order to a general reform in these horrid places of confinement j consi¬ dering it as of the highest importance, not only to the wretched objects themselves, but to the community at large. Upon this subject he was examined in the house of commons in March 1774, when he had the honour of their thanks. This encouraged him to proceed in his design. He revisited all the prisons in the king¬ dom, together with the principal houses ol correction",March,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

"But in order to a more general and happy regula¬ tion, and the reformation of criminals, he determined to visit other countries, to see the plans there adopted ; in hope of collecting some information which might be useful in his own country. For this purpose he tra¬ velled into France, Flanders, Holland, Germany, and Switzerland. Afterwards through the Prussian and Austrian dominions. He visited also the capitals of Denmark, Sweden, Russia, and Poland, and some ci¬ ties in Portugal and Spain. In all these expensive and hazardous journeys, he denied himself the usual grati¬ fications of travellers, and declined the honours which were ofi’ered him by persons of the first distinction, ap¬ plying himself solely to his one grand object.

Nor was he sparing of advice, or of reproof, as he saw occa¬ sion, to persons of rank and influence, whereby the miseries of their countrymen might be relieved. As he courted the favour of none, neither did he fear the frowns of any ; but with a manly freedom and a Christian fortitude, spoke his mind to crowned heads (particularly the late emperor of Germany) in a man¬ ner to which they were not accustomed ; which, how¬ ever, in a person of such disinterested views, procured him reverence and esteem, and in some instances proved effectual for relieving the miserable and oppres¬ sed. On his return, he published in 1777, “ Tlie State of the Prisons in England and Wales, with Preliminary Observations, and an Account of some foreign Prisons.” 4to. And in 1778 he took a third journey through the Prussian and Austrian do¬ minions, and the free cities of Germany, and like¬ wise extended his tour through Italy, and revisited some of the countries he had before seen.

"The substance of all these travels was afterwards thrown into one narrative, which was published in 1784. He also published a curious account of theBas- tile, in 8vo. j that infamous French prison, happily now no more",,FR,6,France,Europe
"His travels and exertions, however, were not yet at an end. He conceived a further design, which was to visit the principal lazarettoes in France and Italy, in order to obtain information concerning the best me¬ thods to prevent the spreading of the plague, with a view to apply them with respect to other infectious disorders. Not gaining all the satisfaction here which he wished for, he proceeded to Smyrna and Constan¬ tinople, where that most dreadful of human distempers actually prevailed, “ pleasing himself (as he said) with the idea of not only learning, but of being able to communicate somewhat to the inhabitants of those di¬ stant regions.” In the execution of this design, though he was so much exposed to danger, and actually caught the plague, “ that merciful Providence (as he him¬ self piously remarks) which had hitherto preserved him, was pleased to extend his protection to him in this journey also, and to bring him home once more in safety.” In his return he revisited the chief pri¬ sons and hospitals in the countries through which he passed ; and afterwards went again to Scotland, and then to Ireland, where he proposed a new and very important object; namely, to inspect the Protestant Charter Schools, in some of which he had before ob¬ served shameful abuses, which he had reported to a committee of the Irish House of Commons. In this more extensive tour, he took a particular account of what he observed amiss in the conduct of this noble charity, with a view to a reformation, and not without considerable success. In the course of these journeys, particular cities and communities were not unmindful HOW to pay him proper respect. At Dublin, he was created Howard by the university a Doctor of Laws j and the city of'-—-^*1 Glasgow and the town of Liverpool did honour to themselves by enrolling him among their members","Smyrna, Providence, Howard, Glasgow","US,FR,IT,IE,GB",6,"United States,France,Italy,Ireland,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Not satisfied, however, with what he had already done, he concludes his “ Account of Lazarettoes” with announcing his “ intention again to quit his coun¬ try, for the purpose of revisiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, and extending his tour in the east. I am not insensible (says he) of the dangers that must attend such a journey. Trusting, however, in the protection of that kind Providence which has hi¬ therto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of unerring wisdom. Should it please God to cut off my life in the prosecution of this design, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to rashness or enthusiasm, but to a serious deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty, and to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrower circle of a retired life.” Accordingly, to the great concern of his friends, h« set out in summer 1789 on this hazardous enterprixe •, the principal object of which was to administer a me¬ dicine in high repute at home, in maligaant fever* under a strong persuasion that it would be equally effi-p*'v‘,er cacious in the plague. In this second tour in the east, “ it did please God to cut off his life :” for, ha¬ ving spent some time at Cherson, a new settlement of the empress of Russia, on the mouth of the Dnieper or Borysthenes, toward the northern extremity of the Black sea, near Oczakow, he caught, in visiting the Russian hospital of that place, or as some say a young lady who was ill of the same complaint, a malignant fever, which carried him off on the 20th of January, after an illness of about twelve days : and after ha¬ ving been kept, according to his express directions to his servant, five days, he was buried, by his own de¬ sire, in the garden of a villa in the neighbourhood, be¬ longing to a French gentleman from whom he bad received [ 650 ] *; M ]fi (in in *7 HOW [ 651 ] HOW imd received great civilities, by his faithful servant who had |j attended him on his former journeyings, and whom he we. expressly enjoined not to return home till five weeks from his death. While absent on his first tour to Tur¬ key, &c. his character for active benevolence had so much attracted the public attention, that a subscrip¬ tion was set on foot to erect a statue to his honour, and in no long space above 1500I. was subscribed for that purpose. But some of those who knew Mr Howard best, never concurred in the scheme, being well assured that he would neither countenance nor accede to it; and in ^'^•consequence of two letters from Mr Howard himself* |v0^i to the subscribers, the design was laid aside. It has, however, been resumed since his death: And surely, of all the statues or monuments ever erected by pub¬ lic gratitude to illustrious characters either in ancient or modern times, none was ever erected in honour of worth so genuine and admirable as his—who devoted his time, his strength, his fortune, and finally sacrificed his life, in the pursuits of humanity :—who (to adopt expressive words of Mr Burke f) “ visited all Eu- ^stn/ rope [and the east], not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the stateliness of temples j not to make ac¬ curate measurements of the remains of ancient gran¬ deur, nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art j not to collect medals, or to collate manuscripts : but to dive into the depth of dungeons ; to plunge into the infection of hospitals $ to survey the mansions of sorrow and of pain 5 to take the gauge and dimensions of mi¬ sery, depression, and contempt ; to remember the for¬ gotten to attend to the neglected ; to visit the forsa¬ ken ; and to compare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries. His plan is original ; and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity. It is a voyage of discovery, a circumnavigation of charity j and al¬ ready the benefit of his labour is felt more or less in every country.” HO WHEN, a town in the east riding of York¬ shire, 180 miles from London, stands on the north side of the Ouse, has a market on Saturdays, and four fairs in the year.

One of them built a very tall steeple to the church here, whither the inhabitants might retire in case of inundations; to which it is very liable from the great freshes that come down the Ouse sometimes at ebb.

From his early attachment to the life of a mariner, he quit¬ ted the school of Eton at the age of 14, and went on board the Severn, the honourable Captain Legge be¬ ing commander, destined for the South seas under Commodore Anson. Mr Howe next appeared in the Burford, Captain Lushington commander, who being killed in an expedition against the Caraccas, Commo¬ dore Knowles made Mr Howe an acting lieutenant. At the age of 20 he was promoted to the rank of command¬ er in the Baltimore sloop of war, and he joined a squa¬ dron at that time cruising off the coast of Scotland, where he met with an opportunity of displaying his undaunted courage and intrepidity, by engaging and beating off two French frigates of 30 guns each, by the assistance of another armed ship, notwithstanding he was severely wounded in the head during the action","Severn, Baltimore","US,UK,FR",6,"United States,N/A,France","North America,N/A,Europe"
"This service was immediately and very justly reward¬ ed with the rank of post-captain. He was soon after appointed to the rank of captain on board Commodore Knowles’s own ship of 80 guns, with which he return¬ ed to England in the year 1748. When hostilities again commenced, he commanded the Dunkirk of 60 guns, in North America ; which ship constituted part of the squadron under Admiral Boscawen, and with which he captured a French man of war of superior metal off the coast of Newfoundland ; viz. the Alcide of 64 guns. In order to annoy the coast of France, he received, in the year 1758, the command of a small squadron, with which he effected the destruction, at St Malo, of a number of magazines and ships. When he served on board the Essex, Prince Edward, afterwards duke of York, sailed with him, at which time he power¬ fully contributed to the reduction of the town of Cher¬ bourg. In 1758 his elder brother fell in North Ame¬ rica in the service of his king and country, on which event the young commodore succeeded to the family title and estate. In the following year he participated of the honourable victory gained by Sir Edward Hawke over the French fleet under Admiral Conflans. He afterwards served in the Channel, and was captain of the Amelia, the ship of admiral the duke of York. On the restoration of peace, he was nominated one of the lords of the admiralty, and some time afterwards, trea¬ surer of the navy. He rvasinthe year 1770, raised to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and chosen com¬ mander-in-chief on the Mediterranean station. In 1775, he rose to the station of rear-admiral of the blue ; in consequence of which rapid promotions, Lord Hawke paid him the following compliment in the house of peers: “ I advised his majesty to make the promo¬ tion. I have tried my Lord Howe on important occa¬ sions ; he never asked me how he was to execute any service, but always went and performed it”","Essex, Prince Edward, York, York","FR,US,CA",6,"France,United States,Canada","Europe,North America,North America"
"In the summer of 1776, Lord Howe appeared off Massachusets, as commander-in-chief of his Britannic majesty’s fleet acting in North America, and in the ca¬ pacity of a commissioner for restoring the blessings of an amicable reconciliation. All the provincial govern¬ ors were made acquainted with his arrival by means of circular letters, expressive also of the full extent of the authority invested in him and his fellow commissioners ; but as congress did not deem the conditions which these letters contained to be at all satisfactory, they were or¬ dered to be inserted in all the gazettes for the exami¬ nation of the people. His powers being thus circum¬ scribed at the very commencement, he could only act in the capacity of a naval commander, in which he aid¬ ed the operations of the land forces with uncommon skill. It was not to be imagined, however, that much glory could redound to his lordship from such an une¬ qual contest, till the junction of France with America placed the contending parties more upon a level.

Here he resigned his command, and came over to England $ but in 1782 he was promoted to the rank of admiral of the blue, made a viscount of Great Britain, and chosen command¬ er of the fleet which was sent for the relief of Gibral¬ tar.

"He was nominated first lord of the admiralty on the termination of the war, which he both resigned and re¬ sumed by difi’erent changes of administration. In the year 1787 he was chosen admiral of the white, and created an earl of Great Britain in the following year. When hostilities were renewed with France in 1793, his lordship accepted the command of the chan¬ nel fleet, at the express desire of his Britannic majes¬ ty, but he had it not in his power to do any thing decisive till the summer of 1794. On the ever me¬ morable 1st of June, with a fleet consisting of 25 sail of the line, he gave battle to a French fleet of 26, gain¬ ing a most signal victory over the enemy, capturing seven of their ships, one of which was so shattered as to go to the bottom, and several others were, in the language of seamen, very much crippled. His lordship had the good fortune not to lose a ship, and compara¬ tively but a few men, considering the prodigious loss in this respect sustained by the enemy. The gratitude of the nation was suitable to the importance of this naval victory, and it is more than probable that the first of June will never be forgotten. In 1795 he was made general of marines: but the infirmities which seldom fail to be the concomitants of old age, induced him to resign his naval command in the year 1797, and on his final retreat he was presented with the honours of the Garter. His great influence as a beloved officer, con¬ tributed greatly to stifle a spirit of mutiny and discon¬ tent which at this time exhibited alarming symptoms among the seamen of his majesty’s fleets. He termina¬ ted his brilliant and honourable career on the 5th of August 1799, in the 73d year of his age, leaving none but female issue behind him. His lordship’s valour, always cool and steady, was consequently of that nature which enables a commander to make the most of his situation j his judgment was sound and penetrating, which prevented him from being easily imposed upon by external appearances; and his seamanship was of the most consummate and masterly kind. It is with pleasure we close this concise account of his lordship’s public life by observing, that his country was deeply sensible of the value and importance of his services, a truth fully evinced by the honours and preferments Howe, Wi which it heaped upon him.

"Hudson's Bay, a large bay of North America, ly¬ ing between 51 and 69 degrees of latitude, discovered in 1610, by Henry Hudson. This intrepid mariner, in searching after a nor: h-west passage to the South seas, discovered three straits, through which he hoped to find out a new way to Asia by America. He had made two voyages before on the same adventure; the first in 1607, and the second in 1608. In his third and last, 16x0, he entered the straits that lead into this new mediterranean, the bay known by his name ; coasted a great part of it; and penetrated to eighty degree* and a half into the heart of the frozen zone. His ardour for the discovery not being abated by the diffi¬ culties he struggled with in this empire of winter, and world of frost and snow, he staid here until the ensu¬ ing spring, and prepared in the beginning of 1611 to pursue his discoveries •, but his crew, who suffered equal hardships, without the same spirit to support them, mutinied, seized upon him and seven of those who were most faithful to him, and committed them to the fury of the icy seas in an open boat.

"HUME, David, Esq. a celebrated philosopher and historian, was born in the south part of Scotland on the 26th of April O. S. in the year 1711. Being the younger son of a country gentleman of good family, but no great fortune, his patrimony was of consequence insufficient to support him. For this reason he was des¬ tined for the bar, and passed through his academical courses in the university of Edinburgh ; but being more inclined to studies of a different nature, he never put on „ , , the gown, nor even took the introductory steps for that short continuance ; and their sufferings, mitigated by purpose. The writings of Locke and Berkeley had di- the famous edict of Nantes, granted to them in 1598 reeled the attention of the generality of learned men to¬ wards HUM E 659 ] HUM I die. wards metaphysics j and Mr Hume having early ap- ^ plied himself to studies of this kind, published in 1739 the two first volumes of his Treatise of Human Nature, and the third the following year. He had the mortifi¬ cation, however, to find his book generally decried j and to perceive, that the taste for systematic writing was now on the decline. He therefore divided this trea¬ tise into separate Essays and Dissertations, which he af¬ terwards published at different times with alterations and improvements","David, Edinburgh, Berkeley, Nantes","PA,GB,US,FR",6,"Panama,United Kingdom,United States,France","North America,Europe,North America,Europe"
"These were better received than his former publica¬ tion 5 but contributed little to his reputation as an au¬ thor, and still less to his profit j and his small patri¬ mony being now almost spent, he accepted an invita¬ tion from the marquis of Annandale to come and live with him in England. With this nobleman he staid a twelvemonth ; during which time his small fortune W'as considerably increased. Pie then received an invitation from General St Clair, to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, hut afterwards ended in an excursion against the coast of France. In 1747, he received an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in his mi¬ litary embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. Pie then wore the uniform of an officer; and was introdu¬ ced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, afterwards General Grant. In 1749, he returned to Scotland, and lived two years with his brother at his countryPionse ; where he composed the second part of his essays, called Political Discourses. And now the general approbation of his performances was indicated by a more extensive sale than formerly, and likewise by the numerous an¬ swers published by different persons in order to counter¬ act their supposed pernicious tendency. In 1752, w’ere published at Edinburgh his Political Discourses, the only work of his which was well received on its first appearance ; and the same year at London, his Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which in his own opinion was incomparably the best of all his perform¬ ances. This year also he was appointed librarian to the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh ; the principal ad¬ vantage resulting from which employment was, that he had by that means the command of a large library. He then formed the plan of writing the History of Eng¬ land : but deeming the whole to be too extensive, he confined his history to that of Britain under the house of Stuart. The book was almost universally decried on its first appearance, and soon after seemed to sink in oblivion. Dr Herring, primate of England, and Dr Stone, primate of Ireland, were the only literati of the author’s acquaintance who approved of the work, and sent him messages not to be discouraged","Annandale, Vienna, Turin, Erskine, Edinburgh, London, Edinburgh, Stuart","GB,US,CA,FR,IE,IT",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Canada,France,Ireland,Italy","Europe,North America,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Notwithstanding the approbation of these eminent men, however, Mr Hume’s spirits were so much sunk by his bad success, that he had some thoughts of retir¬ ing to France, changing his name, and bidding adieu to his own country for ever ; but his design was ren¬ dered impracticable by the breaking out of the war of 1755 between France and Britain. He then published his Natural History of Religion ; to which an answer was published, soon after its appearance, in the name of Dr Hurd bishop of Litchfield and Coventry; of which, however, he since disclaimed being the sole Hume, author. In I75^> second volume of the His- ■ y— tory of the Stuarts was, published, two years after the appearance of the first. This was better received, and helped to retrieve the character of the former volume. Three years after, his History of the House of Tudor made its appearance ; which was almost as ill received as the History of the Stuarts had been, the reign of Elizabeth being particularly obnoxious. The author, however, had now learned to despise popular clamours; and continued to finish at his leisure the more early part of the English history, which was published in 1761, and was received with tolerable success","Coventry, Elizabeth","FR,US,UK",6,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"Mr Hume being now turned of fifty, and having ob¬ tained by the sale of his books a competent and inde¬ pendent fortune, retired into his native country of Scotland, determined never more to set his foot out of it. From this resolution, however, he was diverted by the earl of Hertford ; whom he attended as secre¬ tary on his embassy to Paris in 1763. In 1765, the earl being appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Mr Hume was intrusted with the sole management of the business of the state till the arrival of the duke of Richmond towards the latter end of the year. In 1767, lie returned to Edinburgh, with a much larger income, procured to him by the earl of Hertford, than he formerly had ; and now formed the same design he had formerly entertained, namely, of burying himself in his philosophical retreat. In this, however, he was again disappointed, by receiving an invitation from Ge¬ neral Conway to be under secretary ; and this invita¬ tion he was prevented from declining, both by the character of the person, and his connexions with Lord Hertford. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh, pos¬ sessed of IQ00I. a-year, healthy, and though some¬ what stricken in years, yet having a prospect of long enjoying his ease, and of seeing the increase of his re¬ putation. Of his last illness and character, he him¬ self gives the following account. In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels ; which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits ; inso¬ much, that were I to name the period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this latter period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty- five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities ; and though I see many symptoms of my literary repu¬ tation breaking out at last with additional lustre, I know that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present","Hertford, Paris, Richmond, Edinburgh, Hertford, Conway, Hertford, Edinburgh, Of","GB,US,IE,ZA,TR",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Ireland,South Africa,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa,Asia"
"“ To conclude, historically, with my own character, I am, or rather was (for that is the style 1 must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments)—I was, I say, a man of mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation 4 0 2 in Hume HUM F 660 ] HUM in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper, notwithstand¬ ing my frequent disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary •, and as I took particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men anywise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circum¬ stance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one ; and this is a mat¬ ter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.” His fears concerning the incurableness of his disorder proved too true. He died on the 25th of August 1776 ; and was interred in the Gallon burying-ground, Edinburgh, where a monument is erected to his me¬ mory",Edinburgh,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

Their horses are fleet, but not near so large as the German horses, and therefore they stand up on their short stirrups when they strike. The heydukes usually wear feathers in their caps, accord¬ ing to the number of the enemies they pretend to have killed.

See Guit-Arabic. This gum, combined with sugar and the whites of eggs, has been lately extolled in France, under the name of patigumo, as a remedy for catarrhal defluxions. Dr Percival has seen cakes made of these ingredients, and thinks they might very well be ap¬ plied to the purpose of obviating hunger. They are not perishable in the hottest climates, may be carried about the person with convenience, and though very tough are pleasant to the taste. In the formula by which they are made, the proportion of sugar is too large, and that of gum arable too small, if the mass be intended to assuage the cravings of appetite. Accord¬ ing to our author’s information, the receipt is as fol¬ lows. “ Take of fine sugar four ounces, and of gum- arabic one ounce : Levigate them well together j and add half an ounce of rose water, and of the white of eggs a sufficient quantity.” In our attempts to recover those who have suffered under the calamities of famine, great circumspection is required. Warmth, cordials, and food, are the means to be employed ; and it is evident that these may prove too powerful in their operation, if not administered with caution and judgment. For the body, by long fasting, is reduced to a state of more than infantile debility ; the minuter vessels of the brain, and of the other organs, collapse for want of fluids to distend them ; the stomach and intestines shrink in their capa¬ city ; and the. heart languidly vibrates, having scarcely sufficient energy to propel the scanty current of blood",,FR,6,France,Europe
"Under such circumstances, a proper application of heat seems an essential measure, and may be effected by pla¬ cing on each side a healthy man in contact with the pa¬ tient. Pediluvia or fomentations may also be used with advantage. The temperature of these should be lower than that of the human body, and gradually increased according to the effects of their stimulus. New milk, weak broth, or water gruel, ought to be employed both for the one and the other ; as nutriment may be conveyed into the system this way, by passages probably the most pervious in a state of fasting, if not too long f I iio.Vs protracted. “ A lad at Newmarket f, a few years ago, Ch ical * having been almost starved in order that lie might be reduced to a proper weight for riding a match, was ?

The wine probably stimulated the action of the nervous system, and incited nature, exhausted by abstinence, to open the absorbent pores of the whole body, in order to suck in some nourishment from the air.” But no such ab- Vol, X.

Slender wine-whey will perhaps best answer this purpose j and afford, at the same time, an easy and pleasant nourishment. When the stomach has been a little strengthened, an egg may be mixed with the whey, or administered under some other agree¬ able form.

"Hunter, Dr William, a celebrated anatomist and physician, was born on the 23d of May 1718, at Kilbride fli 'tart Jn t[,e county of Lanerk in Scotland. He was the se- (‘nUS venl^ ^ie children of John and Agnes Hunter, who •Vfr presided on a small estate in that parish called Zorcg Cal- igs of derwood, which had been long in the possession of his ' ' family. His great grandfather by his father’s side, ‘ r' was a younger son of Hunter of Hunterston, chief of the family of that name. At the age of fourteen his father sent him to the college of Glasgow. In this se¬ minary he passed five years, and by his prudent beha¬ viour and diligence acquired the esteem of the profes¬ sors, and the reputation of being a good scholar. His father had designed him for the church : but the idea of subscribing to articles of faith was so repugnant to the liberal mode of thinking he had already adopted, that he felt an insuperable aversion to his theological pursuits. In this state of mind he happened to be¬ come acquainted with Hr Cullen, the late celebrated professor at Edinburgh, who was then just established in practice at Hamilton under the patronage of the duke of Hamilton. Dr Cullen’s conversation soon de¬ termined him to lay aside all thoughts of the church, and to devote himself to the profession of physic. His father’s consent having been previously obtained, Mr Hunter in 1737 went to reside with Dr Cullen. In the family of this excellent friend and preceptor he passed nearly three years : and these, as he has been often heard to acknowledge, were the happiest years of his life. It was then agreed, that he should go and prosecute his medical studies at Edinburgh and Lon¬ don, and afterwards return to settle at Hamilton in HUN partnership with Dr Cullen. He accordingly set out Hunter, for Edinburgh in November 1740; and continued there —y—— till the following spring, attending the lectures of the medical professors, and amongst others those of the late Dr Alexander Monro, who many years afterwards, in allusion to this circumstance, styled himself his old master","Glasgow, Edinburgh, Hamilton, Hamilton, Edinburgh, Hamilton, Edinburgh","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Mr Hunter arrived in London in the summer of 1741, and took up his residence at Mr, afterwards Dr, Smellie’s, who was at that time an apothecary in Pall Mall. He brought with him a letter of recommenda¬ tion to his countryman Dr James Douglas, from Mr Foulis, printer in Glasgow, who had been useful to the doctor in collecting for him different editions of Ho¬ race. Dr Douglas was then intent on a great anato¬ mical work on the bones, which he did not live to complete, and was looking out for a young man of abilities and industry whom he might employ as a dis¬ sector. This induced him to pay particular attention to Mr Hunter; and finding him acute and sensible, he desired him to make him another visit. A second con¬ versation confirmed the doctor in the good opinion he had formed of Mr Hunter ; and without any farther hesitation he invited him into his family to assist in his dissections and to superintend the education of his son.—Mr Hunter having accepted Dr Douglas’s invi¬ tation, was by his friendly assistance enabled to enter himself as a surgeon’s pupil at St George’s Hospital under Mr James Wilkie, and as a dissecting pupil un¬ der Dr Frank Nichols, who at that time taught ana¬ tomy with considerable reputation. He likewise at¬ tended a course of lectures on experimental philosophy by Dr Desaguliers. Of these means of improvement he did not fail to make a proper use. He soon became expert in dissection, and Dr Douglas was at the ex¬ pence of having several of his preparations engraved","London, Douglas, Glasgow, Ho, Of","GB,US,GH,TR",6,"United Kingdom,United States,Ghana,Turkey","Europe,North America,Africa,Asia"
"In 1750 he seems to have entirely relinquished his views in surgery; as in that year he obtained the de¬ gree of Doctor of Physic from the university of Glas¬ gow’, and began to practise as a physician. About this time he quitted the family of Mrs Douglas, and went to reside in. Jermyn-street. In the summer of 1751 he revisited his native country, for which he al¬ ways retained, a cordial affection. His mother was still living at Long Calderwood, which was now become his property by the death of his brother James. Dr Cullen, for whom he always entertained a sincere re¬ gard, was then established at Glasgow, and had ac¬ quired considerable reputation both as a practitioner and teacher of physic ; so that the two friends had the pleasure of being able to congratulate each other on their mutual prosperity. During this visit he showed his attachment to his little paternal inheritance by giving many instructions for repairing and impro¬ ving it, and for purchasing any adjoining lands that might be offered for sale. After this journey to Scot¬ land, to which he devoted only a few weeks, he was ne¬ ver absent from London, unless his professional engage¬ ments, as sometimes happened, required his attendance at a distance from the capital","Glasgow, London",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"In 1755, on the resignation of Dr Layard, one of the physicians of the British lying-in hospital, we find jjtll]le the governors of that institution voting their “ thanks - to Dr Hunter for the services he had done the hospi¬ tal, and for his continuing in it as one of the physi¬ cians so that he seems to have been established in this office without the usual form of an election. The year following he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. Soon afterwards he was elected a member of the Medical Society ; and to the Observa¬ tions and Inquiries published by that society, he at dif¬ ferent periods contributed several valuable papers",,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"In 1763, we find him warmly engaged in controver¬ sy, supporting his claim to different anatomical disco¬ veries, in a work entitled Medical Commentaries, the style of which is correct and spirited. As an excuse for the tardiness with which he brought forth this work, he observes in his introduction, that it required a good deal of time, and he had little to spare j that the subject was unpleasant, and therefore he was very seldom in the humour to take it up. In this publica¬ tion he confined himself chiefly to a dispute with the present learned professor of anatomy at Edinburgh, concerning injections of the testicle, the ducts of the lachrymal gland, the origin and use of the lymphatic vessels, and absorption by veins. He likewise defend¬ ed himself against a reproach thrown upon him by Professor Monro senior, by giving a concise account of a controversy he was involved in with Mr Pott con¬ cerning the discovery of the Hernia Congenita. It was not long before Mr Pott took occasion to give the public his account of the dispute j and, in reply, Dr Hunter added a supplement to his commenta¬ ries, No man was ever more tenacious than Dr Hun¬ ter of what he conceived to be his anatomical rights",Edinburgh,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"In 1767, Dr Hunter was elected a fellow of the Royal Society : and in the year following communi¬ cated to that learned body observations on the bones, commonly supposed to be elephants bones, which have been found near the river Ohio in America. This was not the only subject of natural history on which our jjiintef *0- HUN [ 671 ] HUN } iter, our author employed his pen ; for in a subsequent vo- rUl ' lume of the Philosophical Transactions, we find him offering his remarks on some bones found In the rock of Gibraltar, and which he proves to have belonged to some quadruped. In the same work, likewise, he pub¬ lished an account of the nyl-ghau, an Indian animal not described before. In 1768, Dr Hunter became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries ; and the same year, at the institution of a Royal Academy of Arts, he was appointed by his majesty to the office of professor of ana¬ tomy. This appointment opened a new field for his abi¬ lities $ and he engaged in it, as he did in every other pur¬ suit of his life, with unabating zeal. He now adapted his anatomical knowledge to the objects of painting and sculpture, and the novelty and justness of his observa¬ tions proved at once the readiness and extent of his genius. In January xySi* he was unanimously elected to succeed the late Dr John Fothergill as president of the Medical Society. As his name and talents were known and respected in every part of Europe, so the honours conferred on him w'ere not limited to his own country. In 1780, the Royal Medical Society at Pa¬ ris elected him one of their foreign associates j and in 2782, he received a similar mark of distinction from the Royal Academy of Sciences in that city",,"GI,IN",6,"Gibraltar,India","Europe,Asia"
"He chose rather to execute it at his own expence ; and accordingly purchased a spot of ground in Great Wind¬ mill-street, where he erected a spacious house, to which lie removed from Jermyn-street in I770, I*1 this building, besides a handsome amphitheatre and other convenient apartments for his lectures and dissections, there was one magnificent room, fitted up with great elegance and propriety as a museum. Of the magni¬ tude and value of his anatomical collection some idea may be formed, when we consider the great length of years HUN [ 6?2 1 HUN years he employed in the making of anatomical prepa¬ rations and in the dissection ot morbid bodies, added to the eagerness with which he procured additions from the collections of Sandys, Hewson, .Falconer, Blackall, and others, that were at different times offer¬ ed for sale in this metropolis. His specimens of rare diseases were likewise frequently increased by presents from his medical friends and pupils j who, when any thing of this sort occurred to them, very justly thought theyS could not dispose of it more properly than by placing it in Hr Hunter’s museum. Speaking of an acquisition in this way in one of his publications, he savs, “ I look upon every thing of this kind which is given to me, as a present to the public ; and consider mvself as thereby called upon to serve the public with more diligence.” Before his removal to YVindmill-street, he had con¬ fined his collection chiefly to specimens of human and comparative anatomy and of diseases *, but now he ex¬ tended his views to fossils, and likewise to the promo¬ tion of polite literature and erudition. In a short space of time he became possessed of “ the most magnificent treasure of Greek and Latin books that has been accu¬ mulated by any person now living since the days of Mead.” A cabinet of ancient medals contributed like¬ wise much to the richness of his museum. A descrip¬ tion of part of his coins in this collection, struck by the Greek free cities, was afterwards published by the Doctor’s learned friend Mr Combe. In a classical de¬ dication of this elegant volume to the queen, Hr Hunter acknowledges his obligations to her majesty. In the preface some account is given of the progress of the collection, which has been brought together since the year 1770, with singular taste, and at the expence of upwards of 20,0001. In 1781, the museum received a valuable addition of shells, corals, and other curious subjects of natural history, which had been collected by the late worthy Dr Fothergill, who gave directions by his will, that his collection should be appraised after his death, that Dr Hunter should have the refusal of it at 500!. under the valuation. This was accordingly done, and Dr Hunter purchased it for the sum of 1200I. The fame of this museum spread throughout Europe.

"Dr Hunter, at the head of his profession, honoured with the esteem of his sovereign, and in possession of every thing that his reputation and wealth could con¬ fer, seemed now to have attained the summit of his wishes. But these sources of gratification were embit¬ tered by a disposition to the gout, which harassed him frequently during the latter part of his life, notwith¬ standing his very abstemious manner of living. On Sa¬ turday the 15th March 1783, after having for seve¬ ral days experienced a return of a wandering gout, he complained of great headach and nausea. In this state he went to bed, and for several days felt more pain than usual both in his stomach and limbs. On the Thurs¬ day following he found himself so much recovered, that he determined to give the introductory lecture to the operations of surgery. It was to no purpose that his friends urged to him the impropriety of such an a^ 5 tempt. He was determined to make the experiment, and accordingly delivered the lecture 5 but towards the conclusion his strength was so exhausted that he fainted away, and was obliged to be carried to bed by two ser¬ vants. The following night and day his symptoms were such as indicated danger; and on Saturday morn¬ ing Mr Combe, who made him an early visit, was alarmed on being told by Dr Hunter himself, that du¬ ring the night he had certainly had a paralytic stroke",March,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"As neither his speech nor his pulse were affected, and he was able to raise himself in bed, Mr Combe encou¬ raged him to hope that he was mistaken. But the event proved the doctor’s idea of his complaint to be but too well founded; for from that time till his death, which happened on Sunday the 30th of March, he voided no urine without the assistance of the catheter, which w7as occasionally introduced by his brother : and purgative medicines were administered repeatedly without procuring a passage by stool. These circum¬ stances, and the absence of pain, seemed to show, that the intestines and urinary bladder had lost their sensi¬ bility and power of contraction ; and it was reasonable to presume that a partial palsy bad affected the nerves distributed to those parts",March,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"By his will, the use of his museum, under the di¬ rection of trustees, devolved to his nephew Dr Matthew Baillie, and in case of his death to Mr Cruikshank for the term of thirty years 5 at the end of which period the whole collection is bequeathed to the university of Glasgow, with eight thousand pounds sterling as a fund for the support and augmentation of the collection, which is now deposited at Glasgow","Glasgow, Glasgow",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

"Having acquired some reputation from this first at¬ tempt, his brother employed him in a more difficult dissection, which was an arm wherein all the arteries were injected, and these and the muscles were to be preserved and exposed. In the execution of this task he also gave the highest satisfaction, and his brother predicted that he would become a good anatomist, and never want employment. Under the instructions of bis brother, and Mr Symonds his assistant, he enjoyed every favourable opportunity of increasing his anato¬ mical knowledge, since that school monopolized all the dissections then carried on in London",London,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe

"“ By the bye (says Dr Henry), we may observe that this agreement between the poems of Ossian and the Greek historian, in a circumstance so singular, is at once a proof of the genuine antiquity of these poems, and that the Greek and Roman writers were not so ill informed about the affairs and manners of the ancient Britons as some have imagined.” The Mexicans, whatever imbecility may be impu¬ ted to them in other respects, were very dexterous in hunting. They used bows and arrows, darts, nets, snares, and a kind of tubes named carbottane, through which they shot by blowing out little balls at birds",Roman,"GR,RO",6,"Greece,Romania","Europe,Europe"
"Fire was then set to the grass in a great number of places, and a terrible noise made with drums, horns, shouting, and whistling. The hunters gradually con¬ tracted their circle, continuing the noise till the game were inclosed in a very small space. They were then killed or taken in snares, or with the hands of the hunters. The number of animals taken or destroyed on these occasions was so great, that the first Spanish viceroy of Mexico would not believe it without ma¬ king the experiment himself. The place chosen for his hunting-match was a great plain in the country of 4 Q 2 the (a) Si quis canem veltraum aut segutium vel petrunculum, praesuraserit involare, jubemus ut convictus, coram artuu populo, posteriora ipsius osculetur",,"MX,ES",6,"Mexico,Spain","North America,Europe"
"The plain still retains the Spanish name Cazadero, which signifies the “ place of the chase.” The Mexicans, besides the usual methods of the chase, had particular contrivances for catching certain animals. Thus, to catch young asses, they made a small fire in the woods, putting among the burning coals a particular kind of stone named cacalottl, “ raven or black stone,” which bursts with a loud noise when heated. The fire was covered with earth, and a little maize laid around it. The asses quickly assembled with their young, in order to feed upon the maize j but while they were thus employed, the stone burst, and scared away the old ones by the explosion, while the young ones, unable to fly, were carried off by the hunters. Serpents were taken even by the hands, seizing them intrepidly by the neck with one hand, and sewing up their mouths with the other. This me¬ thod is still practised. They showed the greatest dex¬ terity in tracing the steps of wild beasts, even when an .European could not have discerned the smallest print of their feet. The Indian method, however, was by observing sometimes the herbs or leaves broken down by their feet j sometimes the drops of blood which fell from them when wounded. It is said that some of the American Indians show still greater dexterity in discovering the tracks of their enemies, which to an European would be altogether imperceptible",,ES,6,Spain,Europe
"Hunting was a favourite diversion of the great and bloody conqueror Jenghiz Khan, if indeed we can apply the word diversion to a monster whose mind was set upon the destruction of his own species, and who only endeavoured to make the murder of brutes subservient to that of men, by keeping his soldiers in a kind of warfare with the beasts when they had no human ene¬ mies to contend with. His expeditions were conduct¬ ed on a plan similar to that of the Mexicans already mentioned j and were no doubt attended with still greater success, as his numerous army could enclose a much greater space than all the Indians whom the Spanish viceroy could muster. The East Indian princes still show the same inclination to the chase ; and Mr Blane, who attended the hunting excursions of Asoph Ul Dowlah visir of the Mogul empire and nabob of Gude in 1785 and 1786, gives the following account of the method practised on this occasion",,"ES,IN",6,"Spain,India","Europe,Asia"
"The time chosen for the hunting party is about the beginning of December ; and the diversion is continued till the heats, which commence about the beginning of March, oblige them to stop. During this time a cir¬ cuit of between 400 and 600 miles is generally made j Han ling, the hunters bending their course towards the skirts —v-—/ of the northern mountains, where the country is wild and uncultivated. The visir takes along with him not only his court and seraglio, but a great part of the inhabitants of his capital. His immediate attendants may amount to about 2000 ; but besides these he is also followed by 500 or 600 horse, and several battalions of regular sepoys with their field-pieces. Four or five hundred elephants are also carried along with him t of which some are used for riding, others for fighting, and some for clearing the jungles and forests of the game. About as many sumpter horses of the beauti¬ ful Persian and Arabian breeds are carried along with him. A great many wheel carriages drawn by bul¬ locks likewise attend, which are used chiefly for the convenience of the women ; sometimes also he has an English chaise or two, and sometimes a chariot; but all these as well as the horses are merely for show, the visir himself never using any other conveyance than an elephant, or sometimes when fatigued or indisposed a palanquin. The animals used in the sport are prin¬ cipally grehounds, of which there may be about 3004 he has also about 200 hawks, and a few trained leo¬ pards for hunting deer. There are a great number of marksmen, whose profession it is to shoot deer j with many fowlers, who provide game : as none of the natives of India know how to shoot game with small shot, or to hunt with slow hounds. A vast num¬ ber of matchlocks are carried along with the company, tvith many English pieces of various kinds, 40 or 50 pairs of pistols, bows and arrows, besides swords, dag¬ gers, and sabres without number. There are also nets of various kinds, some for quail, and others very large, for fishing, which are carried along with him upon ele¬ phants, attended by fishermen, so as always to be ready for throwing into any river or lake that may be met with. Every article that can contribute to luxury or pleasure is likewise carried along with the army. A great many carts are loaded with the Ganges water, and even ice is transported for cooling the drink. The fruits of the season and fresh vegetables are daily sent to him from his gardens by bearers stationed at the distance of every ten miles j by which means each ar¬ ticle is conveyed day or night at the rate of four miles an hour.

"Virgilian Husbandry, a term used by authors to express that sort of husbandry, the precepts of which are so beautifully delivered in Virgil’s Georgies. The husbandry in England is Virgilian in general, as is seen by the method of paring and burning the surface, of raftering or cross-ploughing, and of the care in de¬ stroying Aveeds, upon the same principle, and by much the same means. In those parts of England along the southern coast, Avhere the Romans principally inhabi¬ ted, not only the practice, but the expressions, are in many respects the same Avith those of the ancient Ro¬ mans, many of the terms used by the ploughmen being of Latin origin, and the same with those used by those people on the like occasions. And on a strict observa¬ tion, more of Virgil’s husbandry is at this time practised in England than in Italy itself. This change in the Italian husbandry is, however, much more to the credit of that people, than the retaining the Virgilian scheme is to ours",,IT,6,Italy,Europe

"HUS [ 688 ] HUT name, was born in a little village in Bohemia, called Hussy and lived at Prague in the highest reputation, both on account of the sanctity of his manners and the purity of his doctrine. He was distinguished by Ins uncommon erudition and eloquence, and performed at the same time the functions ol professor o£ divinity in the university, and of ordinary pastor in the church of that city. He adopted the sentiments of Wickliffe, and the Waldenses; and in the year 1407 began openly to oppose and preach against divers errors in doctrine, as well as corruptions in point of discipline, then reign¬ ing in the church. Huss likewise endeavoured to the utmost of his power to withdraw the university of Prague from the jurisdiction of Gregory XII. whom the kingdom of Bohemia had hitherto acknowledged as the true and lawful head of the church. This oc¬ casioned a violent quarrel between the incensed arch¬ bishop of Prague and the zealous reformer, which the latter inflamed and augmented from day to day, by his pathetic exclamations against the court of Home, and the corruptions that prevailed among the sacerdotal order","Prague, Prague, Prague",CZ,6,Czechia,Europe
"There were other circumstances that contributed to inflame the resentment of the clergy against him. He adopted the philosophical opinions of the realists, and vehemently opposed and even persecuted the nomina¬ lists, whose number and influence wrere considerable in the university of Prague. He also multiplied the num¬ ber of his enemies in the year 1408, by procuring through his great credit, a sentence in favour of the Bohemians, who disputed with the Germans concern¬ ing the number of suffrages which their respective na¬ tions were intitled to in all matters that were carried by election in this university. In consequence of a de¬ cree obtained in favour of the former, which restored them to their constitutional right of three suffrages, usurped by the latter, the Germans withdrew from Prague, and, in the year 1409, founded a new aca¬ demy at Leipsick. This event no sooner happened, than Huss began to inveigh with greater freedom than he had before done against the vices and corruptions of the clergy, and to recommend, in a public manner, the writings and opinions of Wickliffe, as far as they re¬ lated to the papal hierarchy, the despotism of the court of Rome, and the corruption of the clergy. Hence an accusation was brought against him, in the year 1410, before the tribunal of John XXIII. by whom he was solemnly expelled from the communion of the church. Notwithstanding this sentence of excommuni¬ cation, he proceeded to expose the Romish church with a fortitude and zeal that were almost universally applauded","Prague, Prague, Rome","CZ,US",6,"Czechia,United States","Europe,North America"

"He HUT [ 689 ] HUT H hcson. tlien returned to Ireland : and entering into the v—ministry, was just about to be settled in a small con¬ gregation of dissenters in the north of Ireland, when some gentlemen about Dublin, who knew his great abilities and virtues, invited him to take up a private academy there. He complied with the invitation, and met with much success. He had been fixed but a short time in Dublin, when his singular merits and accomplishments made him generally known ; and his acquaintance was sought by men of all ranks, who had any taste for literature, or any regard for learn¬ ed men. Lord Viscount Molesworth is said to have taken great pleasure in his conversation, and to have assisted him with his criticisms and observations up¬ on his “ Inquiry into the Ideas of Beauty and Vir¬ tue,” before it came abroad. He received the same favour from Dr Synge, lord bishop of Elphin, with whom he also lived in great friendship. The first edi¬ tion of this performance came abroad without the au¬ thor’s name, but the merit of it would not suffer him to be long concealed. Such was the reputation of the work, and the ideas it had raised of the author, that Lord Granville, who was then lord lieutenant of Ire¬ land, sent his private secretary to inquire at the book¬ seller’s for the author ; and when he could not learn his name, he left a letter to be conveyed to him : in consequence of which he soon became acquainted with his excellency, and was treated by him, all the time he continued in his government, with distinguished marks of familiarity and esteem","Dublin, Dublin","IE,US",6,"Ireland,United States","Europe,North America"
"From this time his acquaintance began to be still more courted by men of distinction either for station or literature in Ireland. Archbishop King, the au¬ thor of the celebrated book De ongine mah, held him in great esteem j and the friendship of that prelate was of great use to him in screening him Irom two difterent attempts made to prosecute him for daring to take upon him the education of youth, without having qua¬ lified himself by subscribing the ecclesiastical canons, and obtaining a license from the bishops.

"HUTTON, Dr James, physician and naturalist, was the son of Mr WTilliam Hutton, a respectable mer¬ chant in Edinburgh. He was born on the 3d of June 1726, and lost his father while lie was very young, the charge of his education devolving on his mother, who determined that it should be very liberal. Having finish¬ ed his grammar-school education at the high school of Edinburgh, he entered the university at the age of 1,4 in the year 1740. He always considered himself as greatly indebted to Professor Stevenson’s lectures on lo¬ gic, not because they made him a logician, but because they accidentally gave him a predilection for chemistry which he retained and cherished to the close of life","Edinburgh, Edinburgh",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"He always evinced talents sufficient to encourage the prosecution of his studies; but it was the wish of his friends that he should turn his attention to business, with which he complied though contrary to his own inclinations. In 1743 he was put an apprentice to Mr George Chalmers, writer to the signet, where he soon discovered the ruling propensity of his mind ; for when he should have been transcribing law papers, he was amusing his fellow apprentices with experiments in che¬ mistry. Mr Chalmers perceiving this, generously freed him from his obligations to serve him, desiring him to turn his attention to some other employment more con¬ genial to his views. He fixed his choice on the study of medicine as nearly related to his favourite pursuits, and after spending about three years at Edinburgh, he studied two years at Paris, and returning home by the Low Countries, took his degree of doctor of medicine at Leyden, in September 1749.

"When he arrived in London, about the end of 1749, he conceived the design of settling in the world. He justly conjectured that Edinburgh did not hold out for him any flattering prospects in the capacity of a physi¬ cian, as the principal practice was in the hands of a few eminent physicians who had been long established. He accordingly wrote to his friends in Edinburgh with much anxieiy, as to the subject of his future prospects in life. To Mr James Davie, a young man nearly of liis own age, with whom he contracted a friendship which death only could extinguish, he also communi¬ cated the perplexed state of his mind. Their mutual knowledge of the nature of sal ammoniac led them to establish this manufacture, which afterwards became a most lucrative concern to both. The sentiments of Mr Davie were communicated to Dr Hutton while yet in London, which probably was the chief reason why he resolved to abandon entirely the practice of physic","London, Edinburgh, Davie, London","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"On his return to Edinburgh, in the year 1750, he resolved to devote all his attention to agriculture, which might probably be occasioned by his having succeeded to a small property in Berwickshire on the death of his lather. Mr Play lair of the university of Edinburgh has ascribed it, and we apprehend with great propriety, to the native simplicity of his character, and the mode¬ ration of his views, which wete always free from ambi¬ tion. His attachment to the life of a farmer was in¬ creased by his acquaintance with Sir John Hall of Dun- glass, a gentleman who was very ingenious, a friend and lover of science, and one who well understood agri¬ culture. Determined to make himself master of rural economy, Dr Hutton went into the county of Norfolk, where he continued for some time in the house of a far¬ mer, who was at once his preceptor and his host. The larmer’s name was John Dybold, whose practical know¬ ledge of agriculture Dr Hutton always mentioned in terms of the highest respect","Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Norfolk","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"During bis residence in this county, which was to him a paradise, he made frequent excursions into dif- terent parts of England; and although information re¬ specting rural economy was the great and primary ob- Hutton ject of his pursuit, yet it was here that he first com- ——y— menced the study of mineralogy, to serve him as an amusement on the road. Fie acquainted his friend Sir John Flail, that he was become remarkably fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was narrowly ex¬ amining every pit, or ditch, or bed of a river that fell in his way. The agricultural knowledge he acquired in Norfolk increased his desire to pay a visit to Flan¬ ders, the only place in Europe where husbandry can boast of the greatest antiquity. He set out accordingly in the spring of 1754, and returned to England during the summer of the same year. Soon after his arrival in London, he observed in a letter to Sir John Hail; “ had I doubted of it before I set out, I should have returned fully convinced that they are good husband¬ men in Norfolk.” About this time be returned to his native country, and was for some time at a loss what place to fix upon for the purpose of carrying into effect his agricultural improvements. His own farm at length became his choice, and a ploughman whom he had brought with him from Norfolk gave the first specimen of excellent tillage ever exhibited in that part of Scotland. To Dr Hutton the country is indebted for the introduction of the new husbandry into a county where it may be said to have made more astonishing progress than in almost any other part of the British empire. In the year 1764, he made an excursion into the north of Scotland, in company with Commissioner Clerk, who was after¬ wards Sir George Clerk, a man of singular worth and abilities. They went by Crieff, Dalwhinnie, F'ort Au¬ gustus, and Inverness, and returned along the coast by Aberdeen to Edinburgh. To increase his knowledge of geology was Dr Hutton’s chief aim in this tour, to which he was now determined to pay the most unremit¬ ting attention. About the year 1768 he devoted his whole time to scientific pursuits, and having met with a favourable opportunity of letting hk farm to advan¬ tage, he took up his constant residence in Edinburgh","Norfolk, London, Norfolk, Norfolk, Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Edinburgh","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

"Of the merits or defects of this theory (for an account of which, see Geology), our readers must judge for them- gelves. It has found a very able advocate in Professor Playfair of the university of Edinburgh, whose illustra¬ tions of it have received a very candid and ingenious re¬ ply from an anonymous writer, who entitles his book, A comparative view of the Jrluttonian and Neptunean sys¬ tems of geology. Hr Hutton’s theory did not meet with that reception from the public which the doctor’s admi¬ rers expected, and which it is probable he looked for himself. Professor Playfair thinks it was in a great mea¬ sure owing to the obscurity with which he wrote, so re¬ pugnant to the perspicuity of his conversation $ but as the world had received so many unsatisfactory theories before, it is not improbable that men were become dis¬ gusted with every thing of the kind, and almost deter¬ mined to refuse a hearing to every subsequent attempt","Of, Edinburgh","TR,GB",6,"Turkey,United Kingdom","Asia,Europe"

"HUYGENS, Christian, one of the greatest ma¬ thematicians and astronomers of the 17th century, was the son of Constantine Huygens, lord of Zuylichem, who had served three successive princes of Orange in the quality of secretary 5 and was born at the Hague, in 1629. He discovered from his infancy an extraor¬ dinary fondness for the mathematics ; in a little time made a great progress in them j and perfected himself in those studies under the famous professor Schooten, at Leyden. In 1649, he went to Holstein and Den¬ mark, in the retinue of Henry count of Nassau ; and was extremely desirous of going to Sweden, in order to see Des Cartes, but the count’s short stay in Den¬ mark, would not permit him. He travelled into France and, England; was, in 1663, made a member of the Royal Society ; and, upon his return into France, M. Colbert, being informed of his merit, settled a con¬ siderable pension upon him to engage him to fix at Pa¬ ris ; to which Mr Huygens consented, and staid there from the year 1666 to 1681, where he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. He lived a quiet and studious manner of life, and frequently re¬ tired into the country to avoid interruption, but did not contract that moroseness which is so frequently the effect of solitude and retirement. He was the first who discovered Saturn’s ring, and a third satellite belong¬ ing to that planet, which had hitherto escaped the eyes of astronomers. He discovered the means of render¬ ing clocks exact, by applying the pendulum, and ren¬ dering all its vibrations equal by the cycloid. He brought telescopes to perfection, made many other useful discoveries, and died at the Hague in 1695. He 4 S 2 was HUY [ 692 ] H Y A Huygens, was the author of several excellent works. The princi- Huysum. pal of these are contained in two collections ; the first "" of which was printed at Leyden in 1682, in quarto, under the title of Opera vana ; and the second at Am¬ sterdam in 1728, in two volumes quarto, entitled Opera reliqua","Orange, Nassau","FR,SE,US,BS",6,"France,Sweden,United States,Bahamas","Europe,Europe,North America,North America"
"HUYSUM, the name of several Dutch painters j the most celebrated of whom was John, whose sub¬ jects were flowers, fruit, and landscapes. According to Mr Pilkington, this illustrious painter hath sur¬ passed all who have ever painted in that style; and his works excite as much surprise by their finishing as they excite admiration by their truth. He was born at Amsterdam in 1682, and was a disciple of Justus van Huysum his father. He set out in his profession with a most commendable principle, not so much to paint for the acquisition of money as of fame ; and therefore he did not aim at expedition, but at deli¬ cacy, and, if possible, to arrive at perfection in his art. Having attentively studied the pictures of Mig- non, and all other artists of distinction who had paint¬ ed in his own style, he tried which manner would soonest lead him to imitate the lightness and singu¬ lar beauties of each flower, fruit, or plant, and then fixed on a manner peculiar to himself, which seems almost inimitable. His pictures are finished with in¬ conceivable truth; for he painted every thing after nature ; and was so singularly £xact, as to watch even the hour of the day in which his model appeared in its greatest perfection. By the judicious he was ac¬ counted to paint with greater freedom than Mignon or Breughel; with more tenderness and nature than Mario da Fiori, Michael Angelo di Campidoglio, or Segers ; with more mellowness than De Heem, and greater force of colouring than Baptist. His reputa¬ tion rose to such a height at last, that he fixed immo¬ derate prices on his works ; so that none but princes, or those of princely fortunes, could pretend to become purchasers. Six of his paintings were sold at a public sale in Holland for prices that were almost incredible","Amsterdam, Holland","US,NL",6,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"The vast sums which Van Huysum received for his works, caused him to redouble his endeavours to ex¬ cel ; no person was admitted into his room while he was painting, not even his brothers; and his method of mixing the tints, and preserving the lustre of his colours, was an impenetrable secret, which he never would disclose. Yet this conduct is certainly not to his honour, but rather an argument of a low mind, fearful of being equalled or surpassed. From the same principle, he would never take any disciples, except one lady, named Haverman ; and he grew envious and jealous even of her merit. By several domestic disquiets his temper became changed ; he grew morose, fretful, and apt to withdraw himself from society. He had many enviers of his fame, which has ever been the severe lot of the most deserving in all professions ; but he continued to work, and his reputation never dimi¬ nished. It is universally agreed that he has excelled all who have painted fruit and flowers before him, by the confessed superiority of his touch, by the delicacy of his pencil, and by an amazing manner of finishing; nor does it appear probable that any future artist will become his competitor. The care which he took to purify his oils and prepare his colours, and the various jj experiments he made to discover the most lustrous and Hyacin- durable, are instances of extraordinary care and indus- *^UIS' try as well as capacity. From having observed some v*— of his works that were perfectly finished, some only half finished, and others only begun, the principles by which he conducted himself may perhaps be discover¬ able. His cloths were prepared with the greatest care, and primed with white, with all possible purity, to prevent his colours from being obscured, as he laid them on very lightly. He glazed all other colours except the clear and transparent, not omitting even the white ones, till he found the exact tone of the co¬ lour ; and over that he finished the forms, the lights, the shadows and the reflections, which are all execu¬ ted with precision and warmth, without dryness or negligence. The greatest truth, united with the great¬ est brilliancy, and a velvet softness on the surface of his objects, are visible in every part of his composi¬ tions ; and as to his touch, it looks like the pencil of nature. Whenever he represented flowers placed in vases, he always painted those vases after some elegant model, and the bas-relief is as exquisitely finished as any of the other parts. Through the whole he shows a delicate composition, a fine harmony, and a most happy effect of light and shadow. Those pictures which he painted on a clear ground are preferred to others of his hand, as having greatest lustre, and as they demanded more care and exactness in the finish-, ing ; yet there are some on a darkish ground, in which appears rather more force and harmony. It is obser'? ved of him, that in the grouping of his flowers, he generally designed those which wrere brightest in the centre, and gradually decreased the force of his colour from the centre to the extremities. The birds nests and their eggs, the feathers, insects, and drops of dew* are expressed with the utmost truth, so as even to de¬ ceive the spectator. And yet, after all this merited and just praise, it cannot but be confessed, that sometimes his fruits appear like wax or ivory, without that pecu¬ liar softness and warmth which is constantly observable in nature. Beside his merit as a flower painter, he also painted landscapes with great applause. They are well composed ; and although he had never seen Rome, he adorned his scenes with the noble remains of ancient magnificence which are in that city. His pictures in that style are well coloured, and every tree is distinT guished by a touch that is proper for the leafing. The grounds are well broken, and disposed with taste and judgment; the figures are designed in the manner of Lairesse, highly finished, and touched with a great deal of spirit; and through the whole composition the scene represents Italy, in the trees, the clouds, and the skies.

"He repaired to London at the age of 17, being coun¬ tenanced and protected by his uncle, who was after¬ wards chief justice of the court of king’s bench. On the death of his uncle he was still a student, yet such a heavy H Y D [ 694 ] H Y B heavy misfortune did not deter him from the prosecu¬ tion of his designs. As a licentiousness of manners was at that time extremely prevalent, the well-disposed part of the community considered early marriage as a commendable preservative against irregularity of con¬ duct ; and therefore in compliance with an opinion so respectable, Mr Hyde united himself in wedlock with a beautiful young lady, when he wTas only in the 2ist year of his age, whom he had the misfortune to lose in six months after the celebration of their nuptials, she having fallen a victim to that loathsome malady the smallpox. After a widowhood of three years continu¬ ance, he married the daughter of Sir Thomas Ayles¬ bury, with whom he lived 36 years in conjugal felici¬ ty.

"H is diffidence is very amiably expressed in these words j “ that he never was so proud, or thought himself so good a man, as when he was the worst man in the company.” Being concerned in a cause in behalf of the mer¬ chants of London, he was thus introduced to the no¬ tice of Archbishop Laud, commissioner of the treasury, by whom he was treated with much respect, and had his advancement in the profession of the law greatly pro¬ moted. His easy circumstances and respectable connec¬ tions porverfully contributed to bring him forward and increase his business as a barrister. But in the multi¬ plicity of causes which he was employed to bring be¬ fore different courts, he never lost sight, of polite lite¬ rature, on the study of which he bestowed indefatigable attention, and in bis general deportment he exhibited more of the polished gentleman than of the mere law¬ yer. So great was the reputation which by this time he had acquired, that in 1640 he was chosen burgess for Wotton-Basset and Shaftesbury, in the parliament summoned by Charles I. on account of the Scotch re¬ bellion. As public grievances first attracted the atten¬ tion of this new parliament, Hyde brought forward a statement of the illegal oppressions and malpractices of the earl marshal’s court; but as it was soon dissolved, a radical investigation of the conduct of that court was for a time prevented. The borough of Saltash made choice of him for the new parliament, in which he pleaded so effectually against the earl marshal’s court as to procure its suppression. He now totally abandoned the profession of a barrister, and wholly confined him¬ self to the discussion of public business j and as he was generally supposed to be attached to no particular par¬ ty, he was frequently appointed chairman of commit¬ tees in the. transaction of the most important affairs","London, Hyde",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"Hyde was represented to his majesty in such a fa¬ vourable light, that the king requested a private inter¬ view with him, in the course of which he expressed his great obligations to him for his meritorious services, and was much pleased with his zealous attachment to the church. After this interview he may be considered as devoted to the royal cause 5 and in order to make a proper estimate of his subsequent conduct, it will be ne- Hyde, cessary for our readers to attend to his own declaration. '-—4** He informs us that be had “ a very particular passion and devotion for the person of the king ; and a most zealous esteem and reverence for the constitution of government, which he believed to be so equally poised, that if the least branch of the prerogative was torn off, the subject suffered by it; and he was as much troubled when the crown exceeded its just limits.” He believed the church of England to be most admirably calculated for the promotion of literature, piety, and peace, per¬ haps of any other in the whole world, and deemed the application of any part of its revenue to civil purposes to he the most abominable sacrilege and unpardonable robbery. He also considered the removal of bishops from the house of peers as a violation of the principles ol justice, which made him an enemy to every innova¬ tion in the church from conscientious motives","Hyde, Hyde",GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"When the commons published their remonstrance on the state of the nation, Hyde drew up a reply to it, merely to gratify his own personal indignation, accord¬ ing to his own confession, without the smallest intention of making it public, although it is more than probable that Lord Higby was made acquainted with its con¬ tents. He was, however, at length prevailed upon to allow it to appear as the king’s answer with the advice of h is council. This procured him an offer of the office of solicitor-general, which he thought proper to decline, although he undertook the management of the king’s affairs in parliament, in conjunction with Lord Higby and Sir John Colepepper. Fie opposed the king’s as¬ sent to the bill for depriving the bishops of their seats in the house of peers, in which the sovereign acted in direct opposition to the sentiments of his professed friend, by giving his assent. In the year 1642 his majesty sent for Hyde to York, where he contributed his as¬ sistance in drawing up various papers in the cause of the falling monarch. He was recalled by parliament, but he refused to obey the summons without the royal permission, which excluded him from pardon by a vote of the house","Hyde, York","GB,US",6,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Soon after the breaking out of hostilities between the king and parliament, when the court of the former was held at Oxford, Hyde was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, sworn a member of the privy council, and created a knight. He continued with his majesty till the month of March 1644, when he was appointed to accompany Prince Charles to the west, and afterwards to the island of Jersey, where Sir Edward Hyde con¬ tinued during two years after the departure of the prince, prosecuting his studies with indefatigable in¬ dustry, and composing a history of those memorable transactions in which he himself had borne a distinguish¬ ed part. He likewise published a reply to the parlia¬ mentary declaration of February 1647, in which it was declared improper to send any more addresses to the king. In 1648 he received orders to attend the prince at Paris, who having in the mean time set out for Hol¬ land, Sir Edward took shipping for Hunkirk. The prince was at the Plague when he received the melan¬ choly intelligence of his royal father’s fate. Upon this the council of the young king determined to send am¬ bassadors to Spain, and for this purpose made choice of Sir Edward Hyde and Lord Collington, who arrived at Madrid in 1694 $ and when their residence in that me¬ tropolis H Y D C 695 ] H Y D i(je- tropolis was no longer necessary, Sir Edward returned j to Paris. Tlie king’s court at the Hague was torn by dissension, which made Sir Edward apply for, and ob¬ tain leave to retire to Antwerp, the residence of his wife and children, as he clearly perceived that his personal attendance was not likely to be productive of any substantial good. This retreat afforded him lit- terary and domestic happiness, and was better suited to the reduced state of his finances.

"having assigned Sir Edward a house at Breda free of rent, out of gratitude for his warm attachment to her father, he was prevailed upon to remove to that city",Breda,NL,6,Netherlands,Europe
"It is but doing justice to the memory of Sir Edward Hyde to say that he was the most confidential and faithful minister of Charles II. at the time of the resto¬ ration ; and by the consent of all parties, the many public and private difficulties which this event occa¬ sioned, were settled by him with much wisdom, integri¬ ty and honour. Notwithstanding he was a warm ad¬ vocate for the royal prerogative, it says much for the wisdom of his head and the goodness of his heart, that he was an enemy to the extension of it beyond the li¬ mits prescribed by the constitution ; for when it was proposed to raise a great standing revenue, which would have made the king independent of parliament, it met from Sir Edward the warmest opposition, and he re¬ strained the zeal of the royalists, and their desire of revenge. His zeal for episcopacy was, however, car¬ ried to an extravagant height, as it led him to wish for the annihiliation of every vestige of presbyterianism",Hyde,GB,6,United Kingdom,Europe
"It would perhaps be improper to omit a remarkable circumstance respecting bis daughter, who was a maid of honour to the princess of Orange, as it had every ap¬ pearance of affecting his future fortune in a very ma¬ terial degree. The duke of York was so captivated with the charms of his lordship’s daughter, that he en¬ tered with her into a private contract of marriage, when he found it impracticable to triumph over her virtue, or procure her for a mistress. Finding herself pregnant, she boldly insisted that the duke would make an open avowal of their marriage, which rendered it necessary to make the king acquainted with it; but when it readied the ears of her father, he behaved on the occasion in such a manner, as greatly to tarnish a 5 character so illustrious. He said he would rather see Hyde, his daughter the duke’s mistress than his consort; ad- —y— vised to confine her in the Tower, and even asserted that she ought to lose her head. He was afraid of the king’s indignation, from a supposition that he was privy to the marriage, which there is no good reason for be¬ lieving, yet such an apprehension might bring such ex¬ pressions from him as were wholly incompatible with the feelings of a parent. His extravagant notions of royalty might also have their own weight in producing such an unnatural conduct, since he would conceive the blood of majesty to be contaminated by such an alli¬ ance. To the honour of Charles he behaved on the occasion in a very commendable manner; and not¬ withstanding the rage of the queen-mother, the base conduct of the duke in denying his marriage, and at¬ tempting by calumny to impeach the chastity of his consort, she was at length acknowledged as the du¬ chess of York, and became the mother of two English queens","Orange, York, Hyde, York","US,GB,UK",6,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"Earl Clarendon’s influence with the crown was na¬ turally increased by this marriage, while it as naturally procured him the envy of his fellow courtiers, and pa¬ ved the way to his subsequent degradation. The sale of Dunkirk to the French was viewed as dishonourable by the nation at large, although perhaps on the score of economy and sound policy it was capable of vindi¬ cation. To this we may add the unpopular measure of opposing the bill for granting liberty of conscience, as it brought on him the displeasure both of the king and of all religious sectaries. Even the unfortunate war with the Dutch was charged to his account, although he was known to be its enemy from its very commence¬ ment. Rigidly virtuous himself, the libidinous course of life pursued by his master could not fail to give him offence, and he certainly displeased the king by the freedom of his reproofs. In defiance, therefore, of all his former services, he was basely abandoned to the in¬ dignation of the people, and driven from every office of public trust in the month of August 1667. He was charged with the crime of high-treason by the house of commons, but the peers refused to commit him upon their charge; but while the dispute I ret ween the two houses was yet undetermined, Clarendon received his majesty’s orders to quit the kingdom. His apology to the peers was burnt by the common executioner, and a bill of banishment was issued against him for flying from justice. While he proceeded from Calais to Rouen, the court of France sent an order to him to quit that kingdom, which bodily distress at that time rendered impracticable, upon which the cruel order was reversed. The savage rage of some Englishmen nearly deprived him of his life as he passed from Rouen to Avignon after his recovery; but the court of France punished the perpetrators of the deed. At Montpe¬ lier he met with very respectful treatment during a re¬ sidence of four years, which time he devoted to the vindication of his conduct. Having spent some time at Moulins, he fixed his residence at Rouen, where he ter¬ minated his career in December 1674, in the 68th year of his age. His remains were brought to England, and interred in the abbey of Westminster","Calais, Rouen, Rouen, Avignon, Moulins, Rouen, Westminster","FR,US,NL",6,"France,United States,Netherlands","Europe,North America,Europe"

"Hyde, Dr Thomas, professor of Arabic at Oxford, and one of the most learned writers of the 17th cen¬ tury, was born in 1636 \ and studied first at Cam¬ bridge, and afterwards at Oxford. Before he was 18 years of age, he was sent from Cambridge to London to assist Mr Brian Walton in the great work of the Poly¬ glot Bible ; and about that period undertook to tran¬ scribe the Persian Pentateuch out of the Hebrew cha¬ racters, which Archbishop Usher, who well knew the difficulty of the undertaking, pronounced to be an im¬ possible task to a native Persian. After he had happi¬ ly succeeded in this, he assisted in correcting several parts of Mr Walton’s work, for which he was perfect¬ ly qualified. He was made archdeacon of Gloucester, canon of Christ-church, head keeper of the Bodleian library, and professor both of Hebrew and Arabic in the university of Oxford. He was interpreter and se¬ cretary of the Oriental languages, during the reigns of Charles II. James II. and William III. ; and was perfectly qualified to fill this post, as he could converse in the languages which he understood. There never was an Englishman in his situation of life who made so great a progress $ but his mind was so engrossed by his beloved studies, that he is said to have been but ill qualified to appear to any advantage in common con¬ versation. Of all his learned works (the very cata¬ logue of which, as observed by Anth. Wood, is a cu¬ riosity), his Religio Veterum Persarum is the most ce¬ lebrated.

"4. In the Greek school at Alexandria which flourish¬ ed under the auspices of the Ptolemies, the first at¬ tempts were made at the construction of hydraulic ma- entions chinery. About 1 20 years after the birth of Christ, r-usibiustjje fountain of compression, the syphon, and the for¬ cing pump, were invented by Ctesibius and Hero ; and though these machines operated by the elasticity and weight of the air, yet their inventors had no distinct notions of these preliminary branches of pneumatical science. The syphon is a simple instrument which is employed to empty vessels full of water or spirituous , ci«S liquors, and is of great utility in the arts. The forcing ' ^ pump, on the contrary, is a complicated and abstruse invention, which could scarcely have been expected in ] pt;an the infancy of hydraulics.

"5. Notwithstanding these inventions of the Alexan-Labours of drian school, its attention does not seem to have been Sextus Ju- directed to the motion of fluids. The first attempt to*‘us investigate this subject was made by Sextus Julius Frontinus, inspector of the public fountains at Rome in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan ; and we may justly suppose that his work entitled De Aqiiceductibus urbis Romce Commentarius contains all the hydraulic know¬ ledge of the ancients. Alter describing the Roman aqueducts, and mentioning the dates of their erection, he considers the methods which were at that time em¬ ployed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from adjutages, and the mode of distributing the waters of an aqueduct or a fountain. He justly remarks that the ex pence of water from an orifice, depended not on¬ ly on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the height of the water in the reservoir ; and that a pipe employed to carry off a portion of water from an aque¬ duct, should, as circumstances required, have a position more or less inclined to the original direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted with the true law of the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth of the orifice, we can scarcely be sur¬ prised at the want of precision which appears in his results","Rome, Roman","US,RO",6,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"His cotemporary Guglielmirti, who was inspector of the rivers and canals in the Milanese, had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers, to transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as Ma¬ riotte observed similar obstructions, even in glass pipes, where no transversecurrentscouldexist,thecauseassign- cd by Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher therefore regarded these obstruc¬ tions as the effects of friction. He supposes that the filaments of water which graze along the sides of the pipe lose a portion of their velocity j that the contigu¬ ous filaments having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity-, and that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to the distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity 3 current may be diminished, and consequently the Hisi0,.y# quantity of water discharged in a given time, must,' y—",,FR,6,France,Europe

"To defend themselves from the inundations with which they were threatened, it became necessary for the in¬ habitants to change the course of their rivers j and while they thus drove them from their own territories, they let them loose on those of their neighbours. Hence arose the continual quarrels which once raged between the Bolognese, and the inhabitants of Modena and Fer¬ rara. The attention of the Italian engineers was neces¬ sarily directed to this branch of science *, and hence a greater number of works were vvritten on the subject in Italy than in all the rest of Europe",Modena,IT,6,Italy,Europe
"Expeii- 18. An immense number of experiments on the mo¬ ments of tion of water in pipes and canals was made by Pro- Michelotti. fessor Miohelotti of Turin, at the expence of the sove¬ reign. In these experiments the water issued from holes of different sizes, under pressures of from five to twenty- two feet, from a tower constructed of the finest ma¬ sonry* Basons built of masonry, and lined with stucco, received the effluent water, which was conveyed in ca¬ nals of brickwork lined with stucco, of various forms •and declivities.

"E ri- 22. The most successful labourer in the science of in is and hydrodynamics, tvas the chevalier Buat, engineer in tl 'leva ordinary to the king of France. Following in the steps ,je of the abbe Bossut, he prosecuted the inquiries of that B t, philosopher with uncommon ingenuity ; and in the year 1786, he published his Principes d'l-lydrauh'que, which contains a satisfactory theory of the motion of fluids founded solely upon experiments. The che¬ valier du Buat considered, that if water were a per¬ fect fluid, and the channels in which it flowed infi¬ nitely smooth, its motion would be. continually accele¬ rated, like that of bodies descending in an inclined plane. But as the motion of rivers is not continually accelerated, and soon arrives at a state of uniformity, it is evident that the viscidity of the water, and the fric¬ tion of the channel in which it descends, must equal the accelerating force. M. Buat, therefore, assumes it as a proposition of fundamental importance, that when water flows in any channel or bed, the accelerating force, which obliges it to move, is equal to the sum of all the resistances which it meets with, whether they arise from its own viscidity or from the friction of its tied. This principle was employed by M. Buat, in the first edition of his work, which appeared in 1779’ but the theory contained in that edition was founded on the experiments of others. He soon saw, however, that a theory so new, and leading to results so different from the ordinary theory, should be founded on new experiments more direct than the former, and he was employed in the performance of these from 1780 to 1783. The experiments of Bossut having been made only on pipes of a moderate declivity, M. Buat found it necessary to supply this delect. He used declivities of every kind, from the smallest to the greatest; and made his experiments upon channels, from a line anti a hall 701 in diameter, or seven or eight square toises. All these Hydrosta- experiments he arranged under some circumstances of tics, resemblance, and produced the following proposition, l""“' « which agrees in a most wonderful manner with the im¬ mense number of facts which he has brought toge- , . 307 X vA/—01 —  ther, viz.

"120. To the preceding table as given by Mr Martin We have added the constant number for each fluid, or the pro¬ duct of the altitude of the liquid, and the diameter of the tube (art. 115.). By this number, therefore, we can find the altitude to which any of the preceding fluids will rise in a tube of a given bore, or the diameter of the bore when the altitude of the fluid is known $ for since the constant number CrrDA (art. 113.) we shall have C C Dor —and Arr —. Since the constant number, how- A D ever, as deduced from the experiments of Martin, may not be perfectly correct, it would be improper to de¬ rive from it the diameter of the capillary bore when great accuracy is necessary. The following method, therefore, may be adopted as the most correct that can ^ ^ ( be given. Put into the capillary tube a quantity of^1^.;^ mercury, whose weight in troy grains is W, and lettjie jn er- the length F of the tube which it occupies be accurate-nal diame ly ascertained •, then if the mercury be pure and at theternf9 temperature of 6o° of Fahrenheit, the diameter of thecai1'^fl1? /w tube",Martin,SK,6,Slovakia,Europe
"122. Such are the leading phenomena of capillary tubes. The rise of fluids between two plates of glass re¬ mains to be considered j and while it furnishes us with a very beautiful experiment, it confirms the reasoning by which we have accounted for the elevation of fluids in cylindrical canals. Let ABEF and C.DEF be two pieces of plate glass with smooth and clean surfaces, having their sides EF joined together with wax, and their sides AB, CD kept a little distance by ano- Plate ther piece of wax W, so that their interior surfaces, ftiXVI. whose common intersection is the line EF, may form a '»■ 5- small angle. When this apparatus is immersed in a vessel MN full of water, the fluid will rise in such a manner between the glass panes as to form the curve D oom E, which represents the surface of the elevated water. By measuring the ordinates m n, 0p, &c. of this curve, and also its abscissse F n, F p, &c. Mr Havvks- bee found it to be the common Apollonian hyperbola, having for its assymptotes the surface Db of the fluid, and EF the common intersection of the two planes. To the very same conclusion we are led by the principles already laid down ; for as the distance between the plates diminishes at every point of the curve D q 0 m E from D towards E, the water ought to rise higher at 0 than at q, still higher at rn, and highest of all at E, where the distance between the plates is a minimum. To illustrate this more clearly, g. 6. let ABEF and CDEF be the same plates of glass, (inclined at a greater angle for the sake of distinctness) and let EmqD, and E 0 s B be the curves which bound the surface of the elevated fluid. Then, since the altitudes of the water in capillary tubes are in¬ versely as their diameters or the distances of their op¬ posite sides, the altitudes of the water between two glass plates, should at any given point he inversely as the distances of the plates at that point. Now, the distance of the plates at the point m is obviously mo, or its equal np, and tbe distance at y is ^ s or r/; and since m n is the altitude of the water at m, and q r its altitude at q, we have m n : q v ~ 11 p : v t $ but (GEOMETRY, Sect. IV. Tiieor. XVII.) F n : F r—np therefore in n : q ?'~F n \ F that is, the altitudes of the fluid at the points m, q, which are equal to the abscissae I n, F r (fig. j.) are proportional to the ordinates q t\ m n, equal to F n, Fr, in fig. 5. But in the Apollonian hyper¬ bola the ordinates are inversely proportional to tiieir respective abscissae, therefore the curve Y) qo m E is the YNAMICS. 731 common hyperbola.—As the plates are infinitely near Capillary each other at the apex E, the water will evidently rise AUraction, to that point, whatever be the height of the plates. ^cc- 123. The phenomena which we have been endeavour- * J ing to explain, are all referable to one simple fact, that the particles of glass have a stronger attraction for the particles of water than the particles of water have for each other. This is the case with almost all other fluids jyieiCury except mercury, the particles of which have a stronger descends in attraction for each other than for glass. When capil-capdlary lary tubes therefore are plunged in this fluid, a new se-tul>es* ries of phenomena present themselves to our considera¬ tion. Let MN (fig. 7.) be a vessel full of mercury. Ds- 7- Plunge into the fluid the capillary tube CD, and the mercury, instead of rising in the tube, will remain sta¬ tionary atE, its depression below the level surface AB being inversely proportional to the diameter of the bore. This was formerly ascribed to a repulsive force supposed to exist between mercury and glass, but we shall presently see that it is owing to a very different cause",Plunge,LT,6,Lithuania,Europe
"tween two vertical planes, parallel to each other, andtvvopara plunged in the fluid at their lower extremities, the planes lei rertic tend to come together. Analysis shews us, that if thepl306®!1* fluid be raised between them, each plane will undergo from without inwards a pressure equal to that of a co-togCther, lumn of the same fluid, of which tbe height would be half the sum of the elevations above the level of the points of contact of the interior and exterior surfaces of the fluids with the plane, and of which the base should be the parts of the plane comprised between the two horizontal lines drawn through those points. If the fluid be depressed between tbe planes, each of them will in like manner undergo from without inwards, a pres¬ sure equal to that of a column of the same fluid, of which the height would be half the sum of the depres¬ sions below the level of the points of contact of the in¬ terior and exterior surfaces of the fluid with the plane, and of which the base should be tbe part of the plane comprised between the two horizontal lines drawn through those points.’ 130. As most philosophers seem to agree in thinking Acbarif’ that all the capillary phenomena are referable to theexP*”n^* cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of®”ce,sar the fluid, a variety of experiments has been made intorajge t order to determine the force required to raise a horizon- smface 1 tal solid surface from the surface of a fluid. Mr Ach- a s0^ a ard found that a disc of glass, i-§- French inches in dia- * meter, required a weight of 91 French grains to raise it ( < A i } e i t I t t ( t I ap. III",,FR,6,France,Europe
"Venturi, professor of natural philosophy in the university of Modena, who has illustrated it by a variety of ex¬ periments in his work on the lateral communication of motion in fluids. Let a pipe AC, about half an inch in diameter and a foot long, proceeding from the re¬ servoir AB, and having its extremity bent into the form CD, be inserted into the vessel CDG, whose side DG gradually rises till it passes over the rim of the vessel. Fill this vessel with water, and pour the same fluid into the reservoir AB, till, running down the pipe AC, it foTms the stream EGH. In a short while, the water in the vessel CDG will be carried ofTby the current EG, which communicates its motion to the adjacent fluid. In the same way, when a stream of water runs through air, it drags the air along with it, and produces wind. Hence we have the water blowing machine \yattr which conveys a blast to furnaces, and which shall be Wowing described in a future part of this article. The lateral i),ac^*1!C communication of motion, whether the surrounding fluid be air or water, is well illustrated by the follow¬ ing beautiful experiments of Venturi’s.

"350. If the rising-pipe be made wide, and thus room he made for the air to escape freely up through the wa¬ ter, it will rise to the height assigned ; but if it he nar¬ row, so that the air cannot get up, it rises almost as slow as the water, and by this circumstance the water is raised to a much greater height mixed with air, and this with hardly anv more power. It is in this way that we can account for the great performance of the Flo¬ rentine mac hine, which is almost triple of what a man can do with the finest pump that ever was made : in¬ deed the performance is so great, that one is apt to sus¬ pect some inaccuracy in the accounts. The entry into the rising-pipe should be no wider than the last part of the spiral ; and it would be advisable to divide it into four channels by a thin partition, and then to make the rising-pipe very wide, and to put into it a number ot slender rods, which would divide it into slender chan¬ nels that would completely entangle the air among the water. This will greatly increase the height of the he¬ terogeneous column. It is surprising that a machine that is so very promising should have attracted so little notice. We do not know of any being erected out of Switzerland, except at Florence in 1778. The account of its performance was in consequence of a very public trial in 1779, and honourable declaration of its merit, by Sig. Lorenzo Ginori, who erected another, which fully equalled it. It is shortly mentioned by Professor Sulzer of Berlin, in the Sammlungen Vermischlen Schri- sten for 1754. A description of it is published by the Philosophical Society at Zurich in 1766, and in the descriptions published by the Society in London for the encouragement of Arts in 1776. The celebrated Da¬ niel Bernouilli has published a very accurate theory of it in the Petersburgh Commentaries for 1772, and the machines at Florence were erected according to his in¬ structions. Baron Alstromer in Sweden caused a glass model of it to he made, to exhibit the internal motions for the instruction of artists, and also ordered an opera¬ tive engine to be erected; but we have not seen any account of its performance. It is a very intricate ma¬ chine in its principles j and an ignorant engineer, nay the most intelligent, may erect one which shall hardly do any thing •, and yet by a very trifling change, may become very powerful.
