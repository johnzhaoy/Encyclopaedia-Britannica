"16. But although number be a natural accident of nouns, it can only be considered as essential to those which denote genera or species. Thus we may have occasion to speak of one animal or of many animals, of one man or of many men ; and therefore the nouns ani¬ mal and man must be capable of expressingas well as unity. But this is not the case with respect to the proper names of individuals: for we can only say Xenophon, Aristotle, Plato, &c. in the singular; as, were any one of these names to assume a plural form, it would cease to-be proper name of an individual, and become the common name of a species. Of this, indeed, we have some examples in every language","Plato, Of","CO,TR",6,"Colombia,Turkey","South America,Asia"
"as such admits of a plural; as the Cwsars,the Howards, the Pelhams, the Montagues, &c.: but Socrates can ne¬ ver become plural; so long as we know of no more than one man of that name. The reason of all this will be obvious, if we consider that every genus may be found whole and entire in each of its species ; for man, horse, and dog, are each of them an entire and complete ani¬ mal: and every species may be found whole and entire in each of its individuals: for Socrates, Plato, and Xe¬ nophon, are each of them completely and entirely a man. Hence it is, that every genus, though ONE, is multiplied into many j and every species, though ONE, is also multiplied into MANY ; by reference to those be¬ ings which are their subordinates : But as no individual has any such subordinates, it can never in strictness be considered as MANY j and so, as well in nature as in name, is truly an individual which cannot admit of number",Plato,CO,6,Colombia,South America
"25 ronouns. When Horace says, Prata cauls alblcant pruinis,” ■■■.» the adjective canis denotes a quality common to all hoarfrost; and therefore cannot modify the substantive^ because it adds nothing to the conception of which that substantive is the name. But when the attribute ex¬ pressed by the adjective is competent to some individuals only of the species of which the substantive is the name, the adjective has then the effect of modifying ov limiting the substantive. Thus, when one says vir bonus, he makes use of an adjective which modifies the substantive vir, because it expresses a quality or attribute which -does not belong to all men",Prata,BR,6,Brazil,South America

"An bnpi o- to adversative disjunctives, it has been already said, per dhtiuc- after Mr Harris, that they imply opposition : but the tiou. truth seems to be, that they only unite in the same sen¬ tence words ovphrases of opposite meanings. Now it is obvious, that opposite attributes cannot belongtothe same subject; as when we say, Nereus was beautiful, we can¬ not superadd to this sentence, that he was ugly; we cannot say, he was beautiful but ugly. When there is opposition, it must be either of the same attribute in different subjects; as when we say, li Brutus was a pa¬ triot, BUT Ccesar was not:” Or of different attributes in the same subject j as when we say “ Gorgiusw&s a so¬ phist, but not & philosopher.” Or of different attributes in different subjects; as when we say, ” Plato was a philo¬ sopher, BUT Hippias was a sophist.” The conjunctions used for all these purposes hare been called absolute ad- versatives, we think improperly, as the opposition is not marked by the conjunctions, but by the words or sentences which they serve to connect. Mr Locke, speaking of the word but, says, that “ it sometimes intimates ft stop of the mind, in the course it was going, before it came to the end of itto which Mr Tooke replies with truth, that but itself is the farthest of any word in the language from intimating a stop. On the contrary, it always intimates something to follow; insomuch, that when any man in discourse finishes his words with BUT, instead of supposing him to have stopped, we always ask, BUT what ?- Besides the adversatives already mentioned, there are two other species, of which the most important are un¬ less and ALTHOUGH. For example, “ Troy will be taken, UNLESS the palladium be preserved; Troy will be taken, ALTHOUGH Hector defend it.” The na¬ ture of these adversatives may be thus explained. As every event is naturally allied to its cause, so by parity of reason it is opposed to its,preventive; and as every cause is either adequate ox inadequate (inadequate when it endeavours without being effectual), so in like man¬ ner is every preventive. Now adequate preventives are expressed by such adversatives as UNLESS : “ Troy will be taken, UNLESS the palladium be preserved that is, this alone is sufficient to prevent it. The inadequate are expressed by such adversatives as ALTHOUGH: “ Troy will be taken ALTHOUGH Hector defend itthat is, Hector's defence will prove ineffectual.

"However, it is probable, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of Strabo } for his papers contain a great number of notes and geo¬ graphical disquisitions on that author, particularly with respect to that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he has left upon almost every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that philosopher than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncom¬ mon labour was the Anthologia. In an interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has tran¬ scribed several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading ; has inserted a great number of cri¬ tical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, is uncertain. The only work which he meditated upon with this direct view from the be¬ ginning was a history of English poetry, upon a plan sketched out by Mr Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to those three fine imita¬ tions of Norse and Welsh poetry, which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems. But after he had made some considerable preparations for the exe¬ cution of this design, and Mr Mason had offered him his assistance, he was informed, that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of the same kind.

"The conquerors delivered them from these apprehen¬ sions. The British, indeed, are no merchants in their colonies.

An agent settled in some sea-port of Great Britain is intrusted with the furnishing the plantation and receiving the produce. This was im¬ practicable at Guadalupe j and the conquerors in this respect were obliged to adopt the custom of the con¬ quered. The-British, informed of the advantage the French made of their trade with the colonies, hastened, in imitation of them, to send their ships to the conquer¬ ed island*, and so multiplied their expeditions, that they overstocked the market, and sunk the price of all Eu¬ ropean commodities.

"1 hough it be hard to determine the precise epocha of the gymnastic art, yet it appears from several passages in Homer, and particularly the 23d book of the Iliad, where he describes the games celebrated at the funeral of Patroclus, that it was not unknown at the time of the Trojan war. From that description, which is the earliest monument now extant of the Grecian gymna¬ stics, it appears, that they had chariot-races, boxing, wrestling, toot-races, gladiators, throwing the discus, drawing the bow, and hurling the javelin} and it should seem from the particular account Homer gives of these exercises, that even then the gymnastic art wanted little of perfection : so that when Galen says there was no gymnastic art in Homer’s days, and that it began to appear no earlier than Plato, he is to be understood of the medicinal gymnastics only. This last, indeed, had its rise later} because, while men continued sober and laborious, they had no occasion for it} but when luxu¬ ry and idleness had reduced them to the sad necessity of applying to physicians, these, who had found that nothing contributed so much to the preservation and re-establishment of health as exercises, proportioned to the different complexions, ages, and sexes, did not fail to refer them to the practice of gymnastics",Plato,CO,6,Colombia,South America

"In after-times, the Anglo-Saxons and Danes also considered fine hair as one of the greatest beauties and ornaments of their persons, and were at no little pains in dressing it to advantage. Young ladies before niai’- riage wore their hair uncovered and untied, flowing in ringlets over their shoulders; but as soon as they were married, they cut it shorter, tied it up, and put on a head-dress of some kind or other, according to the pre¬ vailing fashion. To have the hair entirely cut off was so gieat a disgrace, that it was one of the greatest pu¬ nishments inflicted on those women who were guilty of adultery. The Danish soldiers who were quartered up¬ on the English, in the reigns of Edgar the Peaceable and of Ethelred the Unready, were the beaux of those times, and were particularly attentive to the dressing of their hair ; which they combed at least once every day, and thereby captivated the affections of the Eng¬ lish ladies. The clergy, both secular and regular, were obliged to shave the crowns of their heads, and keep their hair short, which distinguished them from the laity } aud several canons were made against their con¬ cealing their tonsure, or allowing their hair to grow long. The shape of this clerical tonsure was the sub¬ ject of long and violent debates between the English clergy on the one hand, and those of the Scots and Piets on the other ; that of the former being circular, and that of the latter only semicircular. It appears very plainly, that long flowing hair was universally esteemed a great ornament; and the tonsure of the clergy was considered as an act of mortification and self-denial, to which many of them submitted with re¬ luctance, and endeavoured to conceal as much as pos¬ sible. Some of them who affected the reputation of su¬ perior sanctity inveighed with great bitterness against the long hair of the laity ; and laboured earnestly to persuade them to cut it short, in imitation of the cler¬ gy. Ihus the famous St Wulstan bishop of Worcester, is said to have declaimed with great vehemence against luxury of all kinds, hut chiefly against long hair as most criminal and most universal. “ The English (says Wil¬ liam of Malmsbury in his life of St Wulstan) were very vicious in their manners, and plunged in luxury, through the long peace which they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The holy prelate Wul¬ stan reproved the wicked of all ranks with great bold¬ ness ; hut he rebuked those with the greatest severity who were proud of their long hair. When any of those vain people bowed their heads before him to receive his blessing, before he gave it, he cut a lock of their hair with a little sharp knife, which he carried about him lor that purpose ; and commanded them, by way of penance for their sins, to cut all the rest of their hair in the same manner. If any of them refused to comply with this command, he denounced the most dreadful judgments upon them, reproached them for their effe¬ minacy, and foretold, that as they imitated women in the length of their hair, they would imitate them in their cowardice when their country was invaded • which was accomplished at the landing of the Nor¬ mans.” Ihis continued to be long a topic of declamation among ,the clergy, who even represented it as, one of the greatest crimes, and most certain marks of repro- , bation. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went so „ far as to pronounce the terrible sentence of excom¬ munication against all who wore long hair, for which pious zeal he is very much commended. Serlo, a Norman bishop, acquired great honour by a sermon which he preached before Henry I. A. D. 1104, against long and curled hair, with which the king and all his courtiers were so much affected, that they consented to resign their flowing ringlets, of which they had been so vain. The prudent prelate gave them no time to change their minds, but immediately pulled a pair of shears out of his sleeve, and performed the operation :( with his own hand. Another incident happened about j 25 years after, which gave a temporary check to the i prevailing fondness for long hair. It is thus related by a contemporary historian : “An event happened, 1 A. D. 1129, which seemed very wonderful to our | young gallants ; who, forgetting that they were men, 1 had transformed themselves into women by the length l of their hair. A certain knight, who was very proud j of his long luxuriant hair, dreamed that a person suffo- S cated him with its curls. As soon as he awoke from i his sleep, he cut his hair to a decent length. The re- 1 port of this spread over all England, and almost all i the knights reduced their hair to the proper standard. ! But this reformation was not of long continuance ; ) for in less than a year all who wished to appear fashion- i able returned to their former wickedness, and contend¬ ed with the ladies in length of hair. Those to whom nature had denied that ornament supplied the defect by art.” The Greeks, and, after their example, the Romans, wore false hair","Young, Worcester, Wil, Canterbury, Norman","UK,UY,ZA,CH,GB,US",6,"N/A,Uruguay,South Africa,Switzerland,United Kingdom,United States","N/A,South America,Africa,Europe,Europe,North America"

Constantly attentive to his favourite cosmogra- phical inquiries, in searching the French libraries, he found a valuable history of Florida, which had been discovered about 20 years before by Captain Loudon- niere and others : this he caused to be published, at his own expence, in the French language, and soon after revised and republished Peter Martyr’s book De orbe novo. After five years residence in France, Mr Hak¬ luyt returned to England in company with Lady Shef¬ field, sister to the lord admiral Howard.

"HALLEY, Dr Edmund, an eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in 1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676, he went to the island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of those which lie near the south pole ; and having delineated a planisphere in which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in 1678. In the year 1680, he took what is called the grand tour, accompanied by his friend the celebrated Mr Nelson. In the midway be¬ tween Calais and Paris, Mr Halley had a sight of a re¬ markable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in its return from the sun. He had the Novem¬ ber before seen it in its descent; and now hastened to complete his observations upon it, in viewing it from the royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was, to settle a friendly correspond¬ ence between the two royal astronomers of Greenwich and Paris j and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a master as Cassini. From thence he went to Italy, where he spent great part of the year 1681 j but his affairs calling him home, he returned to England. In 1683, he published his Theory of the va¬ riation of the magnetical compass; in which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, vyith four magnetical poles, or points of attraction : but af¬ terwards thinking that this theory was liable to great exceptions, he procured an application to be made to King YV illiam, who appointed him commander of the Paramour pink, with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty’s settlements in America.—He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698 : but having crossed the line, his men grew sickly ; and his lieutenant mutinying, he re¬ turned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he set sail a second time in Sep¬ tember following, with the same ship, and another of less bulk, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the vast Atlantic ocean from one hemisphere to the other, as far as the ice would permit him to go ; and having made his observations at St Helena Brazil, Cape Yerd, Barbadoes, the Madeiras, the Ca¬ naries, the coast of Barbary, and many other latitudes arrived in September 1700 $ and the next year publish- 2 ed a general chart, showing at one view the variation Han of the compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as U he was now called, had been at home little more than Halm half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe'""""""""7"" the course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal head-lands in the British channel : which having executed with his usual expedition and accuracy, he published a large map of the British chan¬ nel. Soon after, the emperor of Germany resolving to make a convenient harbour for shipping in the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to view the two ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702 j passed over to Holland} and going through Germany to Vienna, he proceeded to Istria : but the Dutch opposing the design, it was laid aside } yet the emperor made him a present of a rich diamond-ring from his finger, and honoured him with a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Presently after his return, he was sent again on the same business ; when passing through Hanover, he supped with King George I. then electoral prince, and his sister the queen of Prussia. On his arrival at Vienna, he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new for¬ tifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703 } and the same year was made pro¬ fessor of geometry in the university of Oxford, in the room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by that university. He is said to have lost the professorship of astronomy in that city, because he would not profess his belief of the Christian religion. He was scarcely settled at Oxford, when he began to translate into Latin from the Arabic, Apollo¬ nius de sectione rationis ; and to restore the two books De sectione spatii of the same author, which are lost, from the account given of them by Pappus } and he published the whole work in 1706. Afterwards he had a share in preparing for the press Apollonius’s Conics} and ventured to supply the whole eighth book, the ori¬ ginal ol which is also lost. He likewise added Serenus on tlm section of the cylinder and cone, printed from the original Greek, with a Latin translation, and pub¬ lished the whole in folio. In I7I3> he was made secretary of the Royal Society} in 17 20, he was ap¬ pointed the king’s astronomer at the royal observatory at Greenwich, in the room of Mr Flamstead ; and, in 1729, was dhosen as a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He died at Greenwich in 1742","London, Calais, Paris, Paris, Holland, Vienna, Hanover, Vienna, Trieste, Oxford, Oxford, Paris","US,GB,FR,IT,DE,BR,NL,GR",6,"United States,United Kingdom,France,Italy,Germany,Brazil,Netherlands,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,South America,Europe,Europe"
"By their situation among a number of poor princes, the Hamburghers are continually exposed to their rapa¬ ciousness, especially that of the Danes, who have ex¬ torted vast sums from them. The city is very popu¬ lous in proportion to its bulk ; and in 1816 was estimated to contain 115,000 inhabitants, exclusive of 15 ,000 in the neighbouring territory under its au¬ thority.

"Harrington, James, a most eminent English wri¬ ter in the 17th century, bred at Oxford, travelled into Holland, France, Dehttiark, and Germany, and learned the languages of those countries. Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of the privy- chamber extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great fidelity, and made use of his inte¬ rest with his friends in parliament to procure matters to be accommodated with all parties. The king loved his company except when the conversation happened to turn upon commonwealths. He found means to see the king at St James’s ; and attended him on the gcaflold, H A R [ 279 ] H A R Hi ngton, scaffold, where, or a little before, lie received a token l I of his majesty’s affection. After the death of King * J Charles, he wrote his Oceana; a kind ot political ro¬ mance, in imitation of Plato’s Commonwealth, which he dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. It is said, that when Oliver perused it, he declared, that “ the gentle¬ man had wrote very well, but must not think to cheat him out of his power and authority ; for that what he had won by tbe sword, he would not suffer himself to be scribbled out of. This work was attacked by several writers, against whom he defended it. Beside his writings to promote republican principles, he in¬ stituted likewise a nightly meeting of several ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard, Westminster j which dub was called the Rota, and continued till the se¬ cluded members of parliament were restored by Ge¬ neral Monk. In 1661, he was committed to the Tower for treasonable designs and practices ; and Chancellor Hyde, at a conference with the lords and commons, charged him with being concerned in a plot. But a committee of lords and commons could make nothing of that plot. He was convey¬ ed to St Nicholas’s island, and from thence to Ply¬ mouth, where he fell into an uncommon disorder of the imagination. Having obtained his liberty by means of the earl of Bath, he was carried to London, and died in 1677* He published, besides the above works, several others, which were first collected by Toland, in one volume folio, in 1700 : but a more complete edition was published in I737> ^7 ^ie reverend Hr Birch","Oxford, Holland, Plato, Westminster, Rota, Bath, London","US,GB,FR,DE,CO,ES,UK",6,"United States,United Kingdom,France,Germany,Colombia,Spain,N/A","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,South America,Europe,N/A"
"HA V ANNA, a sea-port town in the island of Cuba, in the West Indies, and on the north-west part of it, op¬ posite to Florida. It is famous for its harbour, which is in eveiy respect one of the best in the West In¬ dies, and perhaps in the world. It is entered by a narrow passage, upwards of half a mile in length, which afterwards expands into a large bason, forming three cul de sacs, and is sufficient, in extent and depth, to contain 1000 sail of the largest ships, having almost throughout six fathoms water, and being perfectly co¬ vered from every wind. The town was built by Diego de Velasquez, who conquered the island of Cuba. It was but a small place, and named originally the port of Carenas; A ir H A V C 293 ] H A V jja ,imi( Carenas; but afterwards, wlien the city by its increase of wealth grew considerable, it was called St Christo¬ pher of the Havanna. In 1536, it was of so inconsi¬ derable a value, that being taken by a French pirate, he ransomed the place for the piltry sum of 700 pieces of eight. Some time after it was taken by the English, and a second time by the French : nor was its value understood, nor any care taken to put it in a posture of defence, till the reign of Philip II.; though what was then done proved insufficient. But since the acces¬ sion of a branch of the house of Bourbon to the Spa¬ nish crown, more pains have been taken to render it a place of strength",Florida,"CU,FR,UY,UK",6,"Cuba,France,Uruguay,N/A","North America,Europe,South America,N/A"

"Here the navy of Spain stationed in the West Indies ride ; and here the galleons, the flota, and other mer¬ chant ships from other ports both of the continent and islands, meet in September, to take in provisions and water, with great part of their lading, and for the convenience of returning to Spain in a body. A con¬ tinual fair is held till their departure, which generally happens before the end of the month, when proclama¬ tion is made, forbidding any person belonging to the fleet to stay in town on pain of death ; and accordingly, on firing the warning gun, they all retire on board.— The commerce carried on in this port, which is very considerable ; may be distinguished into the particular commerce of the island of Cuba, and that more general by the galleons and flota. The former consists in hides, usually styled of the Havanna, which are excel¬ lent, and of great value •, sugar, tobacco, admirable in its kind, &c. Though strangers are prohibited to trade, yet a contraband commerce is carried on brisker here than at Vera Cruz. Some little trade is car¬ ried on by other ports of Cuba, but it is very incon¬ siderable.

"The usual height of the plant when growing is from five to six feet, but this varies very considerably ac¬ cording to circumstances. I hat which is cultivated near Bischwiller in Alsace is sometimes more than 12 feet high, and upwards of three inches in circumfe¬ rence, the stalks being so deeply rooted that a very strong man can scarce pull them up. Mr Arthur Young, in a tour through Catalonia in Spain, says, that where the country is well watered, the crops of hemp are extraordinary j and that the plants generally rise to the height of seven feet. In Italy hemp is generally cultivated, though the Bolognese only can pretend to anv superiority in the management of it. It is there sown upon their best lands, which are rich strong loams j and on which they are at all possible pains to procure a fine friable surface. For manure they use dung, pieces of rotten cloth, feathers, and horns brought from Dalmatia. The plant, however, may be cultivated upon ground of every kind ; the poorer land produ¬ cing that which is finer in quality though in smaller quantity*, whereas strong and rich land produces a gieat quantity hut coarser. It does not exhaust the land on which it grows like flax ; whence it is pro¬ bable, that if properly managed, and care taken in the cultivation, it might be found to supersede flax en¬ tirely. A Sussex manufacturer, who writes on this subject in the Annals of Agriculture, informs us, that it may be raised for many years successively on the same ground, provided it be well manured. An acre requires from nine to twelve pecks, according to the nature of the soil *, the latter being the most usual, though a variation in the quality of the soil makes an alteration both in the quantity and quality of the i ] HEM hemp.

"IIENAULT, Charles John Francis, an inge¬ nious French writer, was the son of John Remi Henault lord of Moussy, and was born at Paris in 1685. He early discovered a sprightly benevolent disposition, and his penetration and aptness soon distinguished itself by the success of his studies. Claude de Lisle, father of the celebrated geographer, gave him the same lessons in geography and history which he had before given to the duke of Orleans, afterwards regent; and which have been printed in seven volumes, under the title of “ Abridgement of Universal History.” On quitting college, Henault entered the Oratory, where he soon attached himself to the study of eloquence; and, on the death of the abbe Rene, reformer of La Trappe, he undertook to pronounce his panegyric ; which not meet- HEN [ 374 ] HEN ilennult. ^,e approbation of Father Massilon, he quitted the  ^...

"In one instance, the extreme desire which Prince Henry had of being instructed in military affairs, car¬ ried him beyond those bounds which European nations have prescribed to one another. In 1607 the prince de Joinville, brother to the duke of Guise, came to England, having been obliged to leave France in con¬ sequence of his having made love to the countess de Moret the king’s mistress. After having been for a few weeks magnificently entertained at court, he departed for France in the beginning of June. The prince took an opportunity of sending to Calais in the train of the prince an engineer in his own service, who took the opportunity of examining all the fortifications of the town, particularly those of the Rix-Banc. This was discovered by the French ambassador, who imme¬ diately gave notice of it to court, but excused the prince, as supposing that what he had done was more out of curiosity than any thing else ; and the court seemed to be of the same opinion, as no notice was ever taken of the affair, nor was the friendship between King Henry and the prince in tlie smallest degree interrupt¬ ed. The martial disposition of his highness was great¬ ly encouraged by some people in the military line, who put into his hands a paper entitled “ Propositions for War and Peace.” Notwithstanding this title, how¬ ever, the aim of the author was evidently to promote war rather than peace ; and for this the. following ar¬ guments were used. t.

"On the 10th of June the fleet set sail from Santa Cruz in the island of Teneriffe, and on the 18th came in sight ot the Cape Verd islands, where they steered forStJago: but the want of a favourable wind and other circumstances prevented their getting in j so that as Governor Phillip did not choose to waste time, they did not touch land till they came to Rio Janeiro on the coast of Brazil. It may seem surprising, that a voyage to the eastward, which of itself may be accounted of sufficient length, should thus be wilfully made so much longer, by sailing twice across the Atlantic. The calms, however, so frequent on the coast of Africa, seem of themselves to be a sufficient inducement for na¬ vigators to preserve a westerly course $ and even the islands at which it is so necessary to touch, are not far distant from the American coast. The returning tracks of Captain Cook’s three voyages are all within a little space of the 45th degree of west longitude, which is even 10 degrees farther west than Cape St Roque ; and that course appears to have been taken voluntari¬ ly, without any extraordinary inducement",,"BR,US",6,"Brazil,United States","South America,North America"

"A still farther proof of the genuine and various pur¬ suits of this active mind was given in the year 1772, when his lordship published a work in one volume 8vo, under the title of The Gentleman Farmer, being an attempt to improve Agriculture by subjecting it to the test of rational principles. Our limits do not permit us to give details ; but with regard to this book, we must inform the public, that all the intelligent farmers in Scotland uniformly declare, that, after perusing Young, Dickson, and a hundred other writers on agriculture, Lord Karnes’s Gentleman Farmer contains the best practical and rational information on the va¬ rious articles of husbandry which can any where be obtained. As a practical farmer, Lord Karnes has given many obvious proofs of his skill. After he suc¬ ceeded in right of his lady, to the ample estate of Blair-Drummond in the county of Perth, he formed a plan for turning a large moss, consisting of at least 1500 acres, into arable land. Elis lordship had the pleasure, before he died, to see the plan successfully, though only partially executed. The same plan was afterwards carried on in a much more rapid manner by his son George Drummond, Esq. But as this is not a proper place for details of this nature, we must refer the reader to the article Agriculture •, where a par¬ ticular account of this extraordinary, but extensively useful, operation is given","Young, Perth","UY,GB",6,"Uruguay,United Kingdom","South America,Europe"

"The coast abounds in capes, bays, and roads. Thir¬ ty leagues to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, in S. Lat. 34. 21. is another cape which runs out be- yond 350, called by the Portuguese, who first doubled it, Cabo dos Agulhas, or the Cape of Needles, on ac¬ count of some strange variations in the magnetical needle observed as they came near it. Near this cape is a flat shore, with plenty of fish : it begins in the west near a fresh-water river, and, extending 15 leagues in the main sea, ends in the east near Fish-bay. Cabo Falso, so called by the Portuguese, who returning from India mistook it for the Cape of Good Hope, lies to the eastward between these two capes, about eight or time leagues beyond that of Good Hope. Along the coasts, on both sides of the Cape of Good Hope, are many fine bays. Twenty-seven leagues to the north¬ west is Saldanha bay, so named from a Portuguese cap¬ tain shipwrecked on the coast. The largest and most commodious is Table Bay, on the south, and near the mountain of that name, six leagues in circumference, with four fathoms water close to the beach. Opposite to this bay is Bobu Eilan, or the island of Rabbits in 34. 30. S. Lat. 67 leagues east from the Cape of Good Hope. Peter Both, in 1661, discovered a bay, which he named Uleest, sheltered only from north winds, in which is a small island, and on the west a rivulet of fresh water extremely convenient for European mariners","Cabo, Along, Saldanha","PT,IN,BR,ZA",6,"Portugal,India,Brazil,South Africa","Europe,Asia,South America,Africa"
"Haw H O U How much more reasonable, as well as efficacious, y—would it be, were he to see which were the combatants before he speaks to them. Punishment would then fall, as it ought, on the guilty only. In all packs there are some hounds more quarr'elsome than the rest; and it is to them we owe all the mischief that is done. If you find chastisement cannot quiet them, it may be prudent to break their holders; for since they are not necessary to them for the meat they have to eat, they are not likely to serve them in any good purpose. Young hounds should be fed twice a-day, as they seldom take kindly to the kennel meat at first, and the distemper is most apt to seize them at this time. It is better not to round them till they are thoroughly settled ; nor should it be put off till the hot weather, for then they will bleed too much. It may be better perhaps to round them at (heir quarters, when about six months old ; should it be done sooner, it would make their ears tuck up. The tailing of them is usually done before they are put out ; it might be better, perhaps, to leave it till they are taken in. Dogs must not be rounded at the time they have the distemper upon them, as the loss of blood would weaken them too much",Young,UY,6,Uruguay,South America
"When hounds are to be aired, it is best to take them out separately, the old ones one day, and the young another; though, if they are to have whey from a dis¬ tant dairy, both old and young may be taken out toge¬ ther, observing only to take the young hounds in cou¬ ples, when the old ones are along with them. Young hounds are always apt to fall into mischief, and even old ones when idle will be apt to join them. Mr Beck- ford mentions a whole pack running after a flock of sheep through the mere accident of a horse’s falling, and then running away. * With regard to the first entering of hounds to a scent, our author gives sucii directions as have sub¬ jected him to a severe charge of inhumanity. We shall give them in his own words. “ You had better enter them at their own game : it will save you much trouble afterwards. Many dogs, I believe, like that scent best which they were first blooded to: but be this as it may, it is most certainly reasonable to use them to that which it is intended they should hunt. It may not be amiss first when they begin to hunt to put light collars on them, oung hounds may easily get out of their knowledge ; and shy ones, after they have been much beaten, may not choose to return home. Col¬ lars, in that case, may prevent their being lost.—You say you like to see your young hounds run a trail- scent.—I have no doubt that you would be glad to see them run over an open down, where you could so easily observe their action and their speed. I cannot think the doing of it once or twice could hurt your hounds ; and yet as a sportsman I dare not recommend it to you",Young,UY,6,Uruguay,South America

"117. The preceding experiment completely overturns the hypothesis of Dr Hamilton, afterwards revived by Dr Matthew Young. These philosophers maintained that the fluid was sustained in the tube by the lower ring of glass contiguous to the bottom of the tube, that this ring raises the portion of water immediately below it, and then other portions successively till the portion of water thus raised be in equilibrium with the attraction of the annulus in question. But if the elevation of the fluid were produced in this way, the quantity supported would be regulated by the form and magnitude of the orifice at the bottom of the tube j whereas it is evident from every experiment, that the cylinder of fluid sus¬ tained in capillary tubes has no reference whatever to the form of the lower annulus, but depends solely upon the diameter of the tube immediately above the ele¬ vated column of water",Young,UY,6,Uruguay,South America
