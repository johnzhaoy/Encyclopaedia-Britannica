"AARON, high-prieft of the Jews, and brother to Mofes, was by the father’s fide great-grandfon, and by the mother’s grandfon, of Levi. By God’s command he met Mofes at the foot of mount Horeb, and they went together into Egypt to deliver the children of If- rael: he had a great ffiare in all that Mofes did for their deliverance; the feriptures call him the prophet of Mofes, and he a£led in that capacity after the Ifraelites had paffed over the Red Sea. He afeended mount Si¬ nai with two of his fons, Nadab and Abihu, and fe- venty elders of the people ; but neither he • nor they went higher than half way, from whence they fawthe glory of God; only Mofes and Jolhua went to the top, where they ftaid forty days. During, their abfence, Aaron, overcome by the people’s eager intreaties, fet up the golden calf, which the Ifraelites worfhipped by A his A B [ 2 ] ABA Aaron his confent. This calf has given rife to various con- y jeftures. Some rabbles maintain that he did not make   — the golden calf; but only threw the gold into the fire, to get rid of the importunities of the people; and that certain magicians, who mingled with the Ifraelites at their departure from Egypt, caft this gold into the figure of a calf. According to fome authors, the fear of falling a facrifice to the refentment of the people by giving a refufal, made Aaron com¬ ply with their defire: and they 'alledge alfo, that he hoped to elude their requeft, by demanding of the women to contribute their ear-rings, imagining they would rather choofe to remain without a vifible deity, than be deprived of their perfonal ornaments. This affair of the golden calf happened in the third month after the Ifraelites came out of Egypt. In the firft month of the following year, Aaron was appointed high-prieft by God, which office he executed during the time that the children of Ifrael continued in the wil- dernefs. He died in the fortieth year after their depar¬ ture from Egypt, upon mount Hor, being then an 123 years old; A. M. 2522, of the Julian period 3262, be¬ fore the Chriftian sera 1452.

"ABBOT (George), archbifhop of Canterbury, was born October 29.-1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He went through his ftudies at Oxford, and in 1597 was chpfen principal of Univerfity College. In'!599, he was inftalled dean of Winchefter : the year following, he was chofen vice-chancellor of the univerfity of Ox¬ ford, and a fecond time in 1603'. In 1604, that tranf- lation of the bible now in ufe was begun by the direc¬ tion of king James; and Dr Abbot was the fecond of eight divines of Oxford, to whom the care of tranfla- ting the whole New Teftament (excepting the epiftles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In 1608., he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar, to affift in efta- blifiiing ap union betwixt the kirk of Scotland and the * Beylin’s church of England; and in this affair he behaved* with hift. of Pref- j-jych addrefs and moderation, that it laid the founda- p^:anS' tion of all his future preferment. For king James ever after paid great deference to his advice and counfel; and upon the death of Dr Overton bifliop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his fucceffor, who was accordingly confecrated bilhop of thofe two united fees in December 1609. About a month afterwards he was tranflated to the fee of London, and on the fe¬ cond of November thereafter was raifed to the archie- pifcopal fee. His great zeal for the Proteftant religion made him a ftrenuous promoter of the match between the Eledtor Palatine and the princefs Elizabeth; which was accordingly concluded and folemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbifhop performing the cere¬ mony on a ftage erected in the royal chapel. In the following year happened the famous cafe of divorce be¬ twixt the iadyFrancis Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Effex : an affair which has been by many confidered as one of the greateft blemifhes of king James’s reign; but the part atted therein by the archbifhop added much to the reputation he had al¬ ready acquired for incorruptible integrity. The matter was by the king referred to a court of delegates. The archbifhop fawplainly, that his Majefly was very defirous tjie lady flioqld be divorced^ but. he -was, in his own judgment, dire£tly againfl the divorce. He labour¬ ed all he could to extricate himfelf from this difficulty, by having an end put to the caufe by fome other way than by fentence : but it was to no purpofe; for thofe who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be reftrained from bringing it to the conclufion the king defired. The archbifhop prepared a fpeech, which he intended to have fpoken againft the nullity of the mar¬ riage, in the court at Lambeth ; but he did not make ufe of it, becaufe the king ordered the opinions to be given in few words. He continued, however, in¬ flexible in his opinion againfl: the divorce ; and drew up his reafons, which the king thought fit to anfwer himfelf. It need fcarce be added, that fentence was gi¬ ven in the lady’s favour.—In 1618, the king publifh- ed a declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting fports and paftimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneafmefs to the archbifhop; Archbifhop who, happening to be at Croydon when it came thither,  had the courage to forbid its being read.—Being now in a declining flate of health, the archbifhop ufed in the fummer to go to Hampfhire for the fake of re¬ creation ; and being invited by lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greateft misfortune that ever befell him; for he accidentally kill¬ ed the game-keeper, by an arrow from a crofs-bow which he fhot at one of the deer. This accident threw him into a deep melancholy; and he ever afterwards kept a monthly fall on Tuefday, the day on which this fatal mifchance happened, and he fettled an an¬ nuity of 20/. on the widow*.

"He then gave himfelf up to the duties of his fundlion with great diligence and afliduity, vifiting his whole diocefe in perfon, and preaching every Sunday whilft health would permit. But this was not long: for his fe- dentary life, and clofe application to ftudy, brought upon him the gravel and ftone; of which he died on the 2d of March 1618, in the fifty-eighth year of his age; having not filled the fee quite two years and three months, and being one of the five bifhops which Salif- bury had in fix years.

"Many extraordinary particulars have been told rela¬ ting to his converfion from idolatry. It is a pretty general opinion, that he fucked in the poifon with his milk; that his father mack datues, and taught that they were to be worihipped as gods*.

Abraham anfwered, “ Fifty.”—“ Wretch that thou art, (faid the other,) for adoring, at fuck an age, a being which is but a day old!” Thefe words greatly confounded Abraham. Some time afterwards, a wo¬ man brought him fome flour, that he might give it as an offering to the idols; but Abraham, indead of doing fo, took up a hatchet and broke them all to ieces, excepting the larged, into the hand of which e put the weapon. Terah, at his return, aflced whence came all this havock ? Abraham made an- fwer, that the datues had had a great conted which (hould eat fird of the oblation; “ Upon whieh, (faid A B R A^ra[‘am> he), - the god you fee there, being the ftouteft, hewed ites*1” t^ie ot^ers to pieces with that hatchet.” Terah told — :— him this was bantering; for thofe idols had not the fenfe to aft in this manner. Abraham retorted thefe words upon his father againft the worfhipping of fuch ods.

"The ftory and circumftances relating to his martyrdom, according to Bede, are as follows. Being yet a pagan, (or at leaft it not being known that he was a Chriftian ), he entertained Amphibalus in his houfe. The Roman governor being informed thereof, fent a party of fol- diers to apprehend Amphibalus ; but Alban, putting on the habit of his gueft, prefented himfelf in his ftead, and was carried before that magiftrate. The governor having aiked him of what family he was ? Alban re¬ plied, “ To what purpofe do you inquire of my fa¬ mily ? if you would know my religion, I am a> Chri¬ ftian.” Then being aiked his name, he anfwered, “ My name is Alban; and I worihip the only true and living God, who created all things. ’ The magiftrate replied, “ If you would enjoy the happinefs of eternal life, delay not to facrifice to the great gods.” Alban anfwered, “ The facrifices you offer are made to devils; neither can they help the needy, or grant the petitions of their votaries.” His behaviour fo enraged the go¬ vernor, that he ordered him immediately to be behead¬ ed. In his way to execution, he was ftopped by a ri¬ ver, over which was a bridge fo thronged with fpefta- tors that it was impoffible to crofs it; the faint, as we are told, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and the ftream was miraculoufly divided, and afforded a paffage for himfelf and a thoufand more perfons. Bede does not indeed give us the name of this river; but, notwith- ftanding this omiffion, the miracle, we fuppofe, will not be the lefs believed. This wonderful event convert¬ ed the executioner upon the fpot, who threw away his drawn fword, and, falling at St Alban’s feet, defired he might have the honour to die with him. This hid¬ den converfion of the headfman occafioning a delay in the execution, till another perfon could be got to perform the office, St Alban walked up to a neigh¬ bouring hill, where he prayed for water to quench his thirft, and a fountain of water fprung up under his feet: here he was beheaded, on the 23d of June. The executioner is faid to have been a fignal example of di¬ vine vengeance ; for as foon as he gave the fatal ftroke, his eyes dropt out of his head. We may fee the opinion of Mr Milton in regard to this narrative, in his hif¬ tory of England: his words are thefe, fpeaking of St Alban, “ The ftory of whofe martyrdom, foiled and worfe martyred with the fabling zeal of fome idle fancies, more fond of miracles than apprehenfive of the truth, defcrves no longer digreffion.” Between 4 or 500 years after St Alban’s death, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a very large and (lately monaftery to his memory ; and the town of St Alban’s in Hert- fordlhire takes its name from our protomartyr",Offa,NG,2,Nigeria,Africa

The reafon, probably, is the bad fituation of the town; for it ftands fo low, that it is exceflively hot in fummer, and almoft overflowed with water in the winter. This they affirm to be owing to a curfe of one of their faints. Here are a great number of ftorks, who live very familiarly with the people, walking about the town, poffefiing the tops of the houfes and mofques without molefta- tion; for they efteem them facred birds, and account it finful to difturb them.

The the news"" ^ w^°^e c*ty was on the point of a general infurredtion, when the bafhaw and douwan iffued out a proclamation, forbidding, not only complaints and outcries, under the Algiers ir all foon killed, or forced to fubmit. Pinchinin, in the mean time, made feveral unfuccefsful attempts to re¬ lieve his men, as well as to furround the Dutchman with his other galleys: but that fhip lay fo deep in the water that every fhot did terrible execution among the pirates; fo that they were obliged to remove farther off. At laft the Dutch captain, having ordered his guns to be loaded with cartouches, gave them fuch a parting volley as killed 200 of them, and fent the reft back to Algiers in a moft difmal plight","Algiers, Algiers, Algiers","DZ,NL",2,"Algeria,Netherlands","Africa,Europe"
"But though Pinchinin thus returned in difgrace, the reft of the fleet quickly came back with vaft numbers of flaves, and an immenfe quantity of rich fpoils ; info- much that the Englifh, French, and Dutch, were o- bliged to cringe to the mighty Algerines, who fome- times vouchfafed to be at peace with them, but fwore eternal war againft Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greateft enemies to the Maho- 4? metan name. At laft, Lewis XIV. provoked by the Prepara- grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the tionsagainff coafts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a confiderable fleet to be fitted out againft them, under ei'vls the marquis du Quefne, vice-admiral of France.

"This feverity feemed only to be defigned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding they ftill continued their outrages on the French coaft, he failed to Algiers in Auguft 1682, cannonading and bombard¬ ing it fo furioufly, that the whole town was,in flames in a very little time. The great mofque was battered down, and moft of the houfes laid in ruins, infomuch that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a fudden, the wind turned about, and obliged Du Quefne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made reprifals, by fending a number of galleys and galliots to the coafts of Provence, 1- where they committed the moil dreadful ravages, and brought away a vaft number of captives: upon which a new armament was ordered to be got ready at Tou¬ lon and Marfeilles, againft the next year; and the Al¬ gerines, having received timely notice, put themfelves into as good a ftate of defence as the time would allow","Algiers, Toulon","FR,DZ",2,"France,Algeria","Europe,Africa"

"This laft demand having embarrafled the dey, he af- fembled the douwan, and acquainted them with it: upon which Mezomorto fell into a violent pafiion, and told the afiembly, that the cowardice of thofe who fat at the helm had occafioned'the ruin of Algiers; but that, for his part, he would never confent to deliver up any thing that had been taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the foldiery with what had paffed; which fo exafperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow chofe Mezomorto in his place. This was no fooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and hoftilitles were renewed with greater Algiers, fury than ever","Algiers, Algiers","DZ,FR",2,"Algeria,France","Africa,Europe"
"burnt with fuch vehemence, that the fea was enlight¬ ened with it for more than two leagues round. Mezo¬ morto, unmoved at all thefe difafters, and the vaft num¬ ber of the llain, whofe blood ran in rivulets along the ftreets; or rather, grown furious and defperate, fought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy ; and, not content with caufing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, ordered their conful to be tied hand and foot, and faftened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from ydience he was (hot away againft their navy.— By this piece of inhumanity Du Quefne was fo exaf¬ perated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had ut¬ terly deftroyed all their fortifications, (hipping, almoft all the lower part, and above two thirds of the upper part, of the city ; by which means it became little elfe than an heap of ruins. S® The haughty Algerines were now thoroughly con- vinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore, peac^ immediately fent an embaffy into France, begging in the moft abject terms for peace ; which Lewis imme¬ diately granted, to their inexpreffible joy. They now began co pay fome regard to other nations, and to be a little cautious how they wantonly incurred their dif- pleafure. The firft bombardment by the French had fo far humbled the Algerines, that they condefcended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renew¬ ed, upon terms very advantageous to the latter, in 1686",Algiers,"FR,DZ",2,"France,Algeria","Europe,Africa"
"It is not to be fuppofed, however, that the natural per¬ fidy of the Algerines would difappear on a fudden: not- withftanding this treaty, therefore, they loft no oppor¬ tunity of making prizes of the Englifh Ihips, when Sf they could conveniently come at them. Upon fome in- Seven of fringement of this kind, captain Beach drove alhore their (hips and burnt feven of their frigates in 1695; which pro- b""rnlbyK duced a renewal of the treaty five years after: but it cap eac ‘ was not till the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, that Britain could have a fufficient chek upon them to enforce the obfervation of treaties; and thefe have fince proved fuch reftraints upon Algiers, that they ftill con¬ tinue to pay a greater deference to the Englilh, than to any other European power. ji The prefent century furnilhes no very remarkable e- Expulfion vents with regard to Algiers; except the taking of the famed city of Oran from the Spaniards in 1708, (which however they regained in 1737,) and the expulfion of the Turkilh balhaw, and uniting his office to that of dey in 1710. This introduced the form of govern¬ ment which ftill continues in Algiers. 53 The dey is now abfolute monarch; and pays no o- Revenues, ther revenue to the Porte, than that of a certain num- of * c ber of fine boys or youths, and fome other prefents which are fent thither yearly. His own income, pro¬ bably, rifes and falls according to the opportunities he hath of fleecing both natives and foreigners; whence it is varioufly computed by different authors. Dr Shaw computes the taxes of the whole kingdom to bring into the treafury no more than 300,000 dollars; but fuppofes that the eighth part of the prizes, the effefts of thofe perfons wdio die without children, joined to the yearly contributions raifed by the government, prefents from foreigners","Algiers, Algiers, Oran, Algiers","DZ,GI",2,"Algeria,Gibraltar","Africa,Europe"

"We have already hinted, that the firft deys were e- lefted by the militia, who were then called the dounuan, or common-council. This elective body was at firft compofed of 800 militia-officers, without whofe con- fent the dey could do nothing; and upon fome urgent occafions, all the officers refiding in Algiers, amount¬ ing to above 1500, were fummoned to affift. But fince the deys, who may be compared to the Dutch Stadtholders, have become more powerful, the dou- wan is principally compofed of 30 chiak-balhaws, or colonels, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon fome emergencies; and, on the ele&ion of a dey, the whole foldiery are allowed to come and give their votes",Algiers,"DZ,NL",2,"Algeria,Netherlands","Africa,Europe"
"In leffer offences, they are fined, or their pay ftopped; and if officers, they are reduced to the ftation of com¬ mon foldiers, from whence they may gradually raife Algiers, themfelves to their former dignity.

"Divifion of The kingdom of Algiers is at prefent divided into three provinces or diftrifts, viz. the eaftern, weftern, and fouthern. The eaftern or Levantine government, which is by far the moft confiderable of the three, and is alfo called Beylick, contains the towns of Bona, Conftan- tina, Gigeri, Bujeyah, Steffa, Tebef, Zamoura, Bifcara, and Necanz, in all which the Turks have their garri- fons : befides which, it includes the two ancient king¬ doms of Cuco and Labez, though independent of the Algerine government, to whofe forces their country is inacceffible; fo that they ftilllive under their own cheyks, chofen by each of their adowars or hords. To thefe we may add a French faftory at Callo, under the di- re&ion of the company of the French Baftion.—The weftern government hath the towns of Oran, Tremecen, Moftagan, Tenez, and Secrelly with its caftle and gar- rifon.—The fouthern government hath neither town, village, nor even a houfe, all the inhabitants living in tents, which obliges the bey and his forces to be al- 58 ways encamped","Algiers, Oran","DZ,FR",2,"Algeria,France","Africa,Europe"
"Rivers. The moft confiderable rivers of Algiers are the Zha, or Ziz, which runs acrofs the province of Tremecen, and the defert of Anguid, falling into the Mediterra¬ nean, near the town of Tabecrita, where it has the name of Strut.

(5.) The Celef, fuppofed to be the Carthena of the ancients, falls into the fea, about three leagues weft of Algiers, after a Ihort courfe of 18 or 20 leagues. (6.) The Hued-al- quivir, fuppofed to be the Nalabata, or Nafaba, of the ancients,. and called by the Europeans Zinganir, runs down, with a fwift courfe, through fome high moun¬ tains of Cuco, and falls into the fea near Bujeyah","Algiers, Oran, Algiers",DZ,2,Algeria,Africa
"(8.) The Ladag, or Ludeg, runs down from mount Atlas through part of Conftantina, and falls into the fea a little eaftward of Bona. (9.) Guadi, or Guadel Barbar, fprings from the head of Orbus, or Urbs, in Tripoli, runs through Bujeyah, and falls into the fea near Tabarea. ga Befides thefe there are many others of lefs note ; of Account of which, however, we do not find that the Algerines a- ,hc corfiir| vail themfelves as they might do, their genius leading ^^nmerce» them too much to the piratical trade to mind any real advantage that might be derived from their own coun¬ try. The corfairs, or pirates, form each a fmall re¬ public, of which the rais or captain is the fupreme bafhaw; who, with the officers under him, form a kind of douwan, in which every matter relating to the vef¬ fel is decided in an arbitrary way. Thefe corfairs are chiefly inftrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by way of mer- chandife or prizes. Thefe confift chiefly of gold and filver ftuffs, damalks, cloths, fpices, tin, iron, plated brafs, lead, quickfilver, cordage, fail-cloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, alum, rice, fugar, foap, cot¬ ton raw and fpun, copperas, aloes, brazil and log¬ wood, vermilion, &c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world; the oil, wax, hides, pulfe and corn produced, being but barely fufficient to fupply the country; though, before the lofs of Oran, the merchants have been known to (hip off from one or other of the ports of Barbary feveral thoufand tons of corn. The confumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewife fo confiderable in this kingdom, that it is feldom permitted to be ftiipped off for Eu¬ rope. The other exports confift chiefly in oftriches feathers, copper, ruggs, filk fafties, embroidered hand¬ kerchiefs, dates, and Chriftian flaves. Some manu- fa&ures in filk, cotton, wool, leather, &c. are car¬ ried on in this country, but moftly by the Spaniards fettled here, efpeciaily about the metropolis. Carpets are alfo a manufacture of the country, which, though much inferior to thofe of Turkey, both in beauty and finenefs, are preferred by the people to lie upon, on account of their being both cheaper and fofter. There are alfo, at Algiers, looms for velvet, taffaties, and o- ther wrought filks ; and a coarfe fort of linen is like¬ wife made in moft parts of the kingdom. gt The inhabitants along the fea-coafts are a mixture Inhabitants ( of different nations; but chiefly Moors and Morefcos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain. Here are alfo great numbers of Turks, who come A L G [ 249 ] A L G Algiers, come from the Levant to feek their fortune ; as well as : multitudes of Jews and Chriftians taken at fea, who are brought hither to be fold for flaves. The Bere- bers are fame of the mod ancient inhabitants of the country; and are fuppofed to be defcended from the ancient Sabeans, who came hither from Arabia Felix, under the conduct of one of their princes. Others be¬ lieve them to be fome of the Canaanites driven out of Paleftine by Jofhua. Thefe are difperfed all over Bar¬ bary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their refpeftive chiefs: moft of them inhabit the mountainous parts; fome range from place to place, and live in tents, or portable huts; others in fcattered villages: they have, neverthelefs, kept themfelves for the moft part from in¬ termixing with other nations. The Berebers are reckon¬ ed the richeft of all, go better cloathed, and carry on a much larger traffic of cattle, hides, wax, honey, iron, and other commodities. They have alfo fome artifi¬ cers in iron, and fome manufafturers in the weaving branch.—The name of Bereler is fuppofed to have been originally given them on account of their being firft fettled in fome defert place. Upon their increafing in procefs of time, they divided themfelvcs into five tribes, probably on account of religious differences, called the Zinhagians, Mufamedins, Zeneti, Hoares, and Gome- res ; and thefe having produced 600 families, fubdi- vided themfelves into a great number of petty tribes.— To thefe we may add the Znuoruahs, by European au¬ thors called Azuagues, or AJfagues, who are likewife difperfed over moft parts of Barbary and Numidia","Tripoli, Oran, Algiers, Algiers, Bar","DZ,TR,ES,LY,UA",2,"Algeria,Turkey,Spain,Libya,Ukraine","Africa,Asia,Europe,Africa,Europe"

"“ Other caufes, no lefs remarkable, diminilh the ac¬ tive power of heat in thofe parts of the American con¬ tinent which lie between the tropics. In all that por¬ tion of- the globe, the wind blows in an invariable di- recxion from eaft to weft.

But this fame wind, which brings fuch an acceffion of warmth to the countries lying between the river of Senegal and Cafraria, traverfes the Atlantic ocean before it reaches tl* American (hore.

As neither of thefe fanatics wanted the talents neceffary for fuch an undertaking, great refolution, the appearance of fan&ity, bold pre- tenfions to infpiration, and a confident and plaufible manner of difcourfing, they foon gained many con¬ verts. Among thefe were Rothman, who had firft preached the Proteftant doblrine in Munfter, and Cnip- perdoling, a citizen of good birth and confiderable eminence. Emboldened by the countenance of fuch drfciples, they openly taught their opinions; and not fatisfied with that liberty, they made feveral attempts, tho* without fuccefs, to feize the town, in order to get their tenets eftablifhed by public authority. At laft, having fecretly called in their aflbciates from the neigh¬ bouring country, they fuddenly took poffeffion of the arfenal and fenate-houfe in the night-time; and running through the fleets with drawa fwords, and horrible bowlings, cried out alternately, “ Repent, and be Anabap- “ baptized,” and “ Depart ye ungodly.” The fe- nators, the canons, the nobility, together with the more fober citizens, whether Papifts or Proteftants, terrified at their threats and outcries, fled in confufion; and left the city under the dominion of a frantic mul¬ titude, confifting chiefly of ftrangers. Nothing now remaining to overawe or controul them, they fet about modelling the government according to their own wild ideas: and though at firft they fhowed fo much reve¬ rence for the ancient conftitution, as to ele£l fenators of their own feci, and to appoint Cnipperdoling and another profelyte confuls, this was nothing more than form; for all their proceedings were direfted by Mattjiias, who in the ftyle and with the authority of a prophet uttered his commands, which it was inftant death to difobey. Having begun with encouraging the multitude to pillage the churches, and-deface their ornaments; he enjoined them to deftroy all books, ex¬ cept the bible, as ufelefs or impious; he appointed theeftatesof fuch as fled to be confifcated, and fold to the inhabitants of the adjacent country ; he ordered every man to bring forth his gold, filver, and precious effefts, and to lay them at his feet: the wealth amafled by thefe means, he deppfited in a public treafury, and named deacons to difpenfe it for the common ufe of all. The members of his commonwealth being thus brought to a perfe6t equality, he commanded all of them to eat at tables prepared in public, and even prefcribed the difties which were to be ferved up each day. Ha¬ ving finiftied his plan of “reformation, his next care was to provide for the defence of the city; and he took meafures for that purpofe with a prudence which fa¬ voured nothing of fanaticifm. He colledled vaft ma¬ gazines of every kind ; he repaired and extended the fortifications, obliging every perfon to work in his turn ; he formed fuch as were capable of bearing arms into regular bodies, and endeavoured to add, the vigour of difcipline to the impetuofity of enthufiafm.

The firft command he enjoyed was that of the Weazle floop, in 1722 ; but the moft memorable aftion of his life, and the foundation of his future good for¬ tune, took place on his receiving the command of five fhips, a floop, and two viftuallers, equipped to annoy the Spaniards in the South feas, and to co-operate with admiral Vernon acrofs the Ifthmus of Darien : an ex¬ pedition the principal object of which failed by the unaccountable delay in fitting him out. He failed, however, in Sept. 1740; doubled Cape Horn in a dan¬ gerous feafon ; loft moft of his men by the fcurvy ; and with unly one remaining (hip, the Centurion, crofted the great Pacific Ocean. If no confiderable national ad ¬ vantage refulted from this voyage, Commodore Anfon made his own fortune, and enriched his furviving com¬ panions, by the capture of a rich galleon on her paffage from Acapulco to Manilla ; with which he returned home round the Cape of Good Hope. If he was lucky in meeting this galleon, he was no lefs fortunate in efcaping a French fleet then cruifing in the channel, by failing through it during a fog. He arrived at Spithead in June 1744. In a (hort time after his return, he was appointed rear-admiral of the blue, and one of the lords of the admiralty. In April 1745, he was made rear- admiral of the white, and the following year vice-ad¬ miral of the blue ; at which time he was chofen to re- prefent the borough of Heydon in parliament. In 1747, being on board the Prince George of 90 guns, in Company with Admiral Warren, and twelve other drips, he intercepted, off Cape Finifterre, a powerful fleet, bound from France to the Eaft and Weft Indies; when, by his valoiir and conduit, he again enriched himfelf and his officers, and at the fame time ftrength- ened the Britifh navy, by taking fix men of war and four Eaft-Indiamen, not one of them efcaping.

"In the year 170, Antoninus made vaft preparations againft the Germans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is faid to have happened, which, according to Dion Caflius, was as follows: Antoninus’s army being block¬ ed up by the Quadi, in a very difadvantageous place, where there was no poffibility of procuring water; in this fituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppreffed with heat and thirft, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an inftant the Iky was co¬ vered with clouds, and there fell a vaft quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thirft, when the enemy came upon them with fuch fury, that Antoninus they muft certainly Lave been defeated, had it not been for a fliower of hail, accompanied with a ftorm of thun¬ der and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the leaft annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the vidfory (b). ^In 175, Antoninus made a .treaty with feveral nations of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Caffius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor : this infurreftion, however, was put an end to by the death of Caflius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards thofe who had been engaged in Caflius’s p^r- ty : he would not put to death, nor imprifon, nor even fit in judgment himfelf upon any of the fenators enga- ed in this revolt; but he referred them to the fenate, xing a day for their appearance, as if it had been on¬ ly a civil affair. He wrote alfo to the fenate, defiririg them to a£b with indulgence rather than feverity; not to filed the blood of any fenator or perfon of quality, or of any other perfon whatfoever, but to allow this ho¬ nour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loft their lives, except in the firft heat of the tumult. In 176, Antoninus vifited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thofe countries, and ambaf- fadors alfo from Parthia, came to vifit him. He ftaid feyeral days at Smyrna; and, after he had fettled the affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his fon Commodus, whom, he chofe conful for the year fol¬ lowing, though he was then but 16 years of age, ha¬ ving obtained a difpenfation for that purpofe. On the 27th of September, the fame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commodus, on account of the vi&ories gained over the Germans. Dion Caflius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himfelf and the public treafury during 46 years, from the time that Hadrian had granted the fame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thofe debts. He applied himfelf likewife to correct many enormities, and introduced feveral excellent regulations. In the year 179, he left Rome with his fon Commodus, in order to go againft the Marcomanni, and other barba¬ rous nations; and the year following gained a confider- able vi&ory over them, and would, in all probability, have entirely fubdued them in a very ftiort time, had he not been taken with an illnefs, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign.

"Wa'' Antoninus’s Wall, the name of the third rampart or defence that had been built oi1 repaired by the Romans againft the incurfions of the North Britons. It is call¬ ed by the people in the neighbourhood, Graham's Dyke; from the notion that one Graham, or Grimus, firft made a breach in it after the retreat of the Romans out of Bri¬ tain. The firft barrier erefted by the Romans was the t Sec dgri- chain of forts made by Agricola f from the frith of cola. porth to that of Clyde, in the year 81, to proteft his conquefts from the inroads of the Caledonians. The * See Adri- fecon(j was the vallum, or dyke, flung up by Adrian * in the year 121. It terminated on the weftern fide of the kingdom, at Axelodunum, or Brugh, on the Solway fands; and was fuppofed to have reached no further than Pons JElii, or Newcajlle, on the eaftern. But from an infeription lately difeovered, it appears to have ex- 4 See Seve- tended as far as the wall of Severus if. This rampart m' of Adrian’s was fituated much further fouth than A- gricola’s chain; the country to the north having been either, according to fome authors, recovered by the na¬ tive Britons after the departure of Agricola; or, ac¬ cording to others, voluntarilyflighted by Adrian. How¬ ever, this work of Adrian’s did not long continue to be the extreme boundary of the Roman territories to the north in Britain. For Antoninus Pius, the adopted fon and immediate fucceffor of Adrian, having, by his lieutenant Lollius Urbicus, recovered the country once conquered by Agricola, commanded another rampart to be erefted between the friths of Forth and Clyde, in the trail where Agricola had formerly built his chain of forts. The great number of inferiptions which have been found in or near the ruins of this wall, or rampart, to the honour of Antoninus Pius, leave us no room to doubt its having been built by his direction and com¬ mand. If the fragment of a Roman pillar with an in¬ feription, now in the college library of Edinburgh, be¬ longed to this work, as it is generally fuppofed to have done, it fixes the date of its execution to the third confullhip of Antoninus, which was A. D. 140, only 20 years after that of Adrian, of which this feems to have been an imitation. This wall or rampart, as fome imagine, reached from Caer-ridden on the frith of Forth, to Old Kirkpatrick on the Clyde; or, as o- thers think, from Kinniel on the eaft, to Dunglafs on the weft. Thefe different fuppofitions hardly make a mile of difference in the length of this work, which, from feveral ailual menfurations, appears to have been 37 Englilh or 40 Roman miles. Capitolinus, in his life of Antoninus Pius, diredlly affirms, that the wall which that emperor built in Britain was of turf. This in the main is unqueftionably true; though it is evident (from the veftiges of it ftill remaining, which not very many years ago were dug up and examined for near a mile together) that the foundation was of ftone.

"Whether Apollo was ever a real perfonage, or only the great luminary, many have doubted. Indeed, Vof- fius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a metaphorical being, and that there never was anyo- ther Apollo than the fun. “ He was ftyled the fon of Jupiter, (fays this author), becaufe that god was rec¬ koned by the ancients the author of the world. His mother was called Latona, a name which fignifies hid¬ den; becaufe, before the fun was created, all things were wrapped up in the obfeurity of chaos. He is always reprefented as beardlefs and youthful, becaufe the fun never grows old or decays. And what elfe can his bow and arrows imply, but his piercing beams And adds, “ that all the ceremonies which were per¬ formed to his honour, had a manifeft relation to the great fource of light, which he reprefented. Whence (he concludes) it is in vain to feek for any other divi¬ nity than the fun, which was adored under the name of Apollo.” However, though this is in general true, yet it does appear, from many paflages in ancient authors, that there was fome illuftrious perfonage named Apollo, who, after his apotheofis, was taken for the fun; as Ofiris and Orus in Egypt, whofe exiftence cannot be called in queftion, were, after their death, confounded with the fun, of which they became the fymbols, either from the glory and fplendor of their reigns, or from a belief that their fouls had taken up their refidence in that luminary",Jupiter,"EG,US",2,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

"The names of thefe two governors, who were of very- different difpofitions, were Youkinna and John.

He would therefore gladly have prevailed on Youkinna to purchafe a peace from the Arabs with money, rather than make his country a fcene of blood and ravages} but this not fuiting the martial genius of Youkinna, he armed a confiderable number of the ci¬ tizens, among whom were feveral Chriftian Arabs, and dittributed money among them. He then told his men that he intended to aft offenfively againft the Arabs, and even to engage them if pofiible before they drew too near. To infpire them with the greater refolution, he obferved, that the Moflem army was divided into fe¬ veral bodies; one of which had orders to befiege Cae- farea, another to march to Damafcus, and the third to invade Egypt.

"Though the two armies did not come to a general engagement, yet they had frequent fkirmilhes, in which the Arabs always got the better, and in fome the Greeks fuffered very confiderably. This, together with the fe- verity of the feafon, which was then uncommonly cold, fo deje&ed the foldiery, that they began to defert in great numbers. Conftantine therefore, finding his troops to diminiffi daily, and the Arabs to grow ftronger and ftronger, took the advantage of a tempeftuous night to efcape to Cssfarea, which Yezid had not been able to take, leaving his camp to be plundered by the enemy.

The furrender of this city was followed by that of all the other cities and fortrefles in the province; and thus the Arabs drove the Greeks out of the whole country of Syria extend¬ ing from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates.

"His firft attempt was on Tarma, a town lituated on the ifthmus of Suez. This he reduced after a month’s fiege; and having narrowly viewed its fituation, he formed a defign of cutting through the ifthmus, and thus joining the Mediterranean and Red fea : but this roje& was not well relifhed by the khalif, who appre- ended that it would facilitate the entrance of the Chriftians into the peninfula of Arabia. From Tarma he marched to Mefr, the Memphis of the ancient geo¬ graphers; which, after a fiege of feven months, was de¬ livered up to him by the treachery of A1 Mokawkas the governor. From Mefr he continued his march to¬ wards Alexandria, and, having defeated the emperor’s army, clofely invefted that city. While his army lay be¬ fore this capital, Amru himfelf had the misfortune to be taken prifoner and carried into the town. Being brought before the governor, he afked him why he committed fuch ravages and depredations in the Chri- ftian territories ? To this Amru refolutely anfwered, “ We are come hither fo oblige you either to profefs Mahometanifm,. or pay an annual tribute to the kha¬ lif ; te one of which conditions you mutt fubmit, or be all of you put to the fword.” A Greek who ftood by,, hearing this, told the governor, that Amru was cer¬ tainly the Modem general, and therefore defired him to cut off his head.

In compliance with this order, Amru fent a train of camels laden with corn, in a continued line from E- gypt to Medina, the lirft of which were entering Me¬ dina when the laft were leaving Alexandria. But this method of conveying corn proving too tedious and ex- penfive, he ordered him to clear the Amnis Trajanus of Ptolemy, now the Khalis, which runs from one end of Cairo to the other, of the fand and gravel with which it was choked. This he accordingly did, and by that means rendered the communication between Egypt and Arabia much more eafy than it had formerly been. p(j While the Arabs thus extended their conquefts in The Fer¬ tile weft, they were no lefs fuccefsful in the eaft.

As the kings of Hira were under the protedlion of the Perfian monarchs, the deftrudlien of that kingdom ne- ceffarily brought on a war with the Perfians. After the departure of Khaled, the command of the forces was left with Abu Obeid Ebn Mafud, together with A1 Mothanna Ebn Haretha, Amru Ebn Hafem, and Salit Ebn Kis. Abu Obeid having paffed a river, con¬ trary to the advice of the other generals, was killed, and his troops in great danger; however, A1 Mothanna made an excellent retreat, and repaffed the river with¬ out any conliderable lofs. After this he fortified him¬ felf in his camp till he received a confiderable reinforce¬ ment from the khalif; when the Modem army marched to Dir Hind, and thence continued to make frequent excurfions, ravaging that part of Irak that lay next to the Euphrates.

Sedition was induftrioufly propagated through all the provinces of the empire, and articles of accufation brought againft the khalif. The chief of thefe were, That he had recalled one who had been ba- nifhed by the prophet; that he had removed Saad, an officer of diilinguifhed bravery, and fupplied his place by one who drank wine, and was otherwife of a fcan- dalous life ; that he had fquandered away vaft fums a- mong his favourites ; that he had removed Amru from the government of Egypt, to which he had preferred his own fofter-brother; and, laftly, that he had pre- 4 B 2 fumed A R A [ 568 ] A R A Arabia, fumed to fit on the top of Mahomet’s pulpit, whereas Abu Beer had always fat on the higheft ftep, and Omar on the loweft. To this formidable accufation the poor khalif pleaded guilty, and promifed to make all the re¬ paration in his power; but his condefcenfion only fer- ved to increafe the infolence of the rebels. They were however appeafed by Ali; and public tranquillity had undoubtedly been reftored, had it not been for Ayefha, one of Mahomet’s widows, who procured the deftruc- tion of the khalif by a fcheme truly worthy of the wife of fuch an huiband. That traitrefs, being defirous of raifing one of her favourites named Telha to the digni¬ ty of khalif, prevailed on Merwan thefecretary offtate to write a letter to the prefect of Egypt, enjoining him to put to death Mahomet Ebn Abu Beer, with whom it was fent, and who was to be his fucceffor. This letter Merwan took care Ihould be difeovered; and Ma¬ homet taking it for a genuine order of the khalif, pu- bliihed the fuppofed injury all over the neighbouring countries. He then marched with a body of rebels to Medina, where the innocent khalif was befieged in his palace; and, notwithftanding all his proteftations, no¬ thing lefs than his death could fatisfy the enraged mul¬ titude. In this deplorable fituation, Othman fent to Ali for affiftance, who commanded his two fons Hafan and Hofein to defend the palace-gates.

"After this viftory, Ali had no enemies to contend with either in Arabia, Irak, Egypt, Perfia, or Khora- fan. A ftrong party, however, ftill remained in Sy¬ ria, headed by Moawiyah, who founded his claims to the khalifat on a pretended declaration of Otbman that he fhould be his fucceffor.

This he continued to do after Merwan was proclaimed khalif, infomuch that a battle foon enfued between his followers and thofe of Merwan, in which Dahak was defeated and killed; and thus Merwan became matter of all the province of Sy¬ ria. Soon after this victory, Merwan advanced with a confiderable body of troops towards Egypt; but fent before him Amru Ebn Said with a detachment, in or¬ der to facilitate his paffage. That general having de¬ feated Abdalrahman, Abdallah’s lieutenant, in feveral hr ilk aftions, he at laft furrendered the whole country to Merwan for a fum of money, and retired with the Arabs under his command to Hejaz. The Syrian troops, therefore, immediately took poffeffion of that country, and obliged the inhabitants to take an oath of allegiance to Merwan, who, having appointed his fon Abdalazziz to prefide over Egypt, returned with the greateft part of his forces to Damafcus.

But while Soliman and his troops remained yet inaftive, A1 Mokhtar, who had ferved under Abdallah, and was difgufted at not having been promoted as he expe&ed, arrived at Cufa, and, reprefenting the inca¬ pacity of Soliman, who indeed appears to have been totally unfit for fuch an enterprize, offered to take the command upon himfelf.

Upon this di- fafter, A1 Mokhtar, fearing the houfe of Ali might be intimidated, fent a letter to Mahomet Ebn Hanifyah, one of that family, in which he offered his affiftance 139 with a powerful army.

"A R A [ 582 ] A R A perfpicuous and clear Arabic, is referred to I/htnael as its author; who, fay the above-mentioned writers, firft fpoke it; and, as Dr Pocock believes, after he had con- trafted an alliance with the family of Jorham by mar¬ riage, formed it of their language and the original He¬ brew. As, therefore, the Hamyaritic dialeft partook principally of the Syriac, fo that of the Koreiih was fuppofed to confift chiefly of the Hebrew.

"Aratus, a Greek poet, born at Soli, or Solae, a town in Cilicia, which afterwards changed its name, 4 E and A R A [* 590 ] ARB and was called Pompeiopolis, in honour of Pompey the Great. He flourilhed about the 124th, or, according to forne, the 126th Olympiad, in the reign of Ptole¬ my Philadelphus king of Egypt. He difcovered in his youth a remarkable poignancy of wit, and capaci¬ ty for improvement ; and having received his education under Dionyfius Heracleotes, a Stoic philofopher, he efpoufed the principles of that deft. Aratus was phy- fician to Antigonus Gonatus, the fon of Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedon : this prince, being a great encourager of learned men, fent for him to court, admitted him to his intimacy, and encouraged him in his ftudies. The Phenomena of Aratus, which is ftill extant, gives him a title to the charafter of an aftro- nomer, as well as a poet; in this piece he defcribes the nature and motion of the ifars, and fhews the particular influences of the heavenly bodies, with their various dif- politions and relations. He wrote this poem in Greek verfe: it was tranflated into Latin by Cicero ; who tells us, in his firltbook De oratore, that the verfes of A- ratus are very noble. This piece was tranflated by o- thers as well as Cicero ; there being a tranflation by Germanicus Csefar, and another into elegant verfe by Feftus Avienus. An edition of the Phenomena was publifliedby Grotius, at Leyden, in quarto, 1600, in Greek and Latin, with the fragments of Cicero’s verfion, and the tranflations of Germanicus and Avie¬ nus, all which the editor has illuftrated with curious notes. He was certainly much efteemed by the an¬ cients, frnce we find fo great a number of fcholiafts and commentators upon him. There are feveral other works alfo afcribed to Aratus. Suidas mentions the following: Hymns to Pan; Aftrology and Aftrothefy; a compofition of Antidotes; an EkiSvIixov on Theopro- pus; an Hdoxout on Antigonus ; an Epigram on Phila, tfie daughter of Ahtipater, and wife of Antigonus ; an Epicedium of Cleombrotus; a Corre6fion of the Odyffey ; and fome Epiftles, in profe. Virgil, in his Georgies, has imitated or tranflated many paffages from this author; and St Paul has quoted a pafiage of Aratus.

The height of Solomon’s pillars, without the chapiter, was 18 cu¬ bits ; that of the chapiter itfelf was five cubits ; the circumference was 12 cubits ; from whence, according to the Scripture language, we may reckon the diame¬ ter to have been exaftly four cubits.

"This was terraced, and ferved as a plain for people to walk on; and from this they could look through the windows down into the room. To this terrace there was no covering required, as the Egyptians were in no fear of rain. The Egyptians decorated this fort of building with ftatues; and no kind of ornament could anfwer it fo well, as the light cannot fall upon ftatues to fuch advantage in any dire&ion, as when it comes from above, in fuch a regular, proportioned, and unin¬ terrupted manner. 13 We have already taken notice, that among the an- Ancient ar¬ dent Egyptians, Perfians, and Babylonians, the vaft chitefture ftrength and extent of their buildings feems to have gr2ndeur to been what they chiefly valued; and in this they cer- the modern, tainly as much excelled the Greeks and modern nations, as the latter excel them in the beautiful proportion and elegance of their ftructures. There are not want¬ ing, however, fome modern authors, who endeavour to deprive the ancients of what isjuftly their due, and will have every thing to be exaggerated which feems be¬ yond the power of modern princes to accomplifli.

Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effeft, that the walls of Babylon could have been 318 feet high, and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhew us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium, and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it mull contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiltorians, this immenfe mafs of building was fmifhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchednezzar, or whoever fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for ten years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as llrongly as it is faid to have been ; *for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly fo, amounting to 18,189,600 folid fathoms. When our author afterwards gafconades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power, tafte, and time, to finilh Verfailles, with all its defe&s, than to confiruA a pyramid, or e- re& an obelilk.” The genius, tafte, and time, we (hall not difpute ; but as the fame author confefles that 100,000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftruflion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time the abovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fome of the works of which M. Goguet boafts fo much.

His imagination,was warm and lively, and his genius particularly turned to raillery: he had alfo great- fpirit and refolution ; and was a declared enemy to flavery, and to all thofe who wanted to opprefs their country. The Athenians fuf- fered themfelves in his time to be governed by men who had no other views than to make themfelves ma¬ tters of the commonwealth. Ariftophanes expcfed the defigns of thefe men, with great wit and feverity, upon the ftage. Cleo was the firft whom he attacked, in his- comedy of the Equites ; and as there was not one of the comedians who would venture to perfonate a man of his great authority, Ariftophanes played the character himfelf, and with fo much fuccefs, that the Athenians obliged Cleo to pay a fine of five talents, which were given to the poet. He defcribed the af¬ fairs of the Athenians in fo exa<tt a manner, that his comedies are a faithful hiftory of that people. For this reafon, when Dionyfius king of Syracufe deisred to learn the ftate and language of Athens, Plato fent him the comedies of Ariftophanes, telling him, thefe were the bett reprefentation thereof.

The ' Clouds, which he wrote in ridicule of Socrates *, is the moft celebrated of all his comedies : Madam Dacier tells us, (he was fo much charmed with this perform¬ ance, that after (lie had tranflated it, and read it over 200 times, it did not become the lead tedious to her, which (he could not fay of any other piece; and that the pleafure which (he received from it was fo exqui- fite, that (he forgot all the contempt and indignation which Ariftophanes deferved for employing his wit to ruin a man, who was wifdom itfelf, and the greateft ornament of the city of Athens.

Here he married Pythias, the filler of this prince, whom he is faid to have loved fo paffionate- ly, that he offered facrifice to her.

Some fay he poi- foned himfelf, to avoid falling into the hands of his e- nemies ; others affirm, that he threw himfelf into the Euripus, becaufe he could not comprehend the reafon of its ebbing and flowing ; and there are fome who tell us he died of a colic, in the 63d year of his age, being the third of the 114th Olympiad, two years after Alex¬ ander.

In the large towns of ancient Egypt, a phyfician was confined to a fingle difeal'e. In me¬ chanic arts that method is excellent. As a hand con¬ fined to a fingle operation becomes both expert and ex¬ peditious, a mechanic art is perfected by having its dif¬ ferent operations diftributed among the greateft num¬ ber of hands: many hands are employed in making a watch ; and a ftill greater number in manufacturing a web of woollen cloth.
