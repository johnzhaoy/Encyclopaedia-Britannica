"After furveying any particular fcience, it will be found equally ufeful and^ en¬ tertaining to acquire fome notion of the private hiftory of fuch eminent perfons as have either invented, cultivated, or improved, the particular art or fcience in which our attention has been recently engaged. This has induced the com¬ pilers to enrich the Encyclopsedia Britannica with a new department, which is not to be found in any other colledtion of the fame kind, except in the French Encyclopedie. Of all hiftorical purfuits, Biography is perhaps the moft delightful and inftrudtive. Its tendency to illuftrate particular palfages in general hiftory, and to diffufe new light through the arts and fciences in which the perfons whofe lives are related were employed, is too obvious to require ex¬ plication. Befides, it exhibits the human charader in all poflible forms and fi- tuations. It not only attends its hero through all the buftle of public life, but purfues him to his moft fequeftered retirements. It fhows, how diftinguifhed characters have been involved in misfortunes and difficulties; by what means they were extricated; or with what degree of fortitude and dignity they have difcharged the various functions, or fuftained the different viciffitudes, of a che¬ quered and fluctuating life. For thefe reafons it is, that every man of learning and genius has efteemed the biographical labours of Plutarch among the moft precious and valuable remains of antiquity.

Vanity and precipitance are the great fources of fcepticifm: hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plunged themfelves into an abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcepticifm.

Hence, by the medium of that fluid, founds can be propagated through wood, or metals, even more readily than through the open air. By the fame means, deaf people may be made fenfible of founds, if they hold a piece of metal in their mouth, one end of which is applied to the founding body. As it is certain, therefore, that air cannot penetrate metals, we muft acknowledge the medium of found to be of a more fubtile nature; and thus the elecftricaf fluid will naturally occur as the proper one. But why then is found no longer heard in an exbaufted receiver, if the air is not the fluid by which it is conveyed, feeing the electrical matter cannot be excluded ? The reply to this is ob¬ vious: The eleCtrical fluid is fo exceedingly fubtile, and pervades folid bodies with fo much eafe,thatany motion of a fo¬ lid body in a quantity of eleCtric matter by itfelf, can never excite a degree of agitation in it fufficient for producing a found ; but if the eleCtric fluid is entangled among the particles of air, water, wood, metal, &c. whatever affeCts their particles will alfo affeCt this fluid, and produce an audible noife. In the experiment of the air-pump, however, there may be an ambiguity, as the gradual exhaufting of the air creates an increafing difference of preffure on the outf.de, and may oceafion in the giafs a difficulty of vibrating, fo as to render it lefs lit to communicate to the air without the vibrations that ftrike it from within. From this caufe the diminution of found in an exhaufted receivertnay be fup¬ pofed to proceed, as well as from the diminution of the air. But if any internal agitation of Its parts fhould hap¬ pen to the eieCtrical fluid, exceeding loud noifes might be propagated through it, as has been the cafe when large me¬ teors have kindled at a great diftance from the earth. Of this an inftance is recorded in the Philofophical TranfaCtions by Dr Halley. (See Fire). It is alfo difficult to account for the exceeding great fwiftnefs-ef found, upon the fuppo- lition that it is propagated by means of air alone; for nothing is more certain, than that the ftrongeft and moft violent gale is, in its courle, inert and (luggifh, compared with the motion of found",Of,TR,2,Turkey,Asia
"Let us now then fuppofe a ftringed inftrument fitted up in the order mentioned above. For inftance: Let the firft firing be twice as long as the fecond ; let the third firing be three times Ihorter than the firft, let the fourth be four times, the fifth firing five times, and the fixth fix times as Ihort as the firft. Such an in¬ ftrument would probably give us a reprefentation of the lyre as it came firft from the hand of the inven¬ tor. This inftrument will give us all the feven notes following each other, in the order in which any two of them will accord together moft pleafingly; but yet it will be a very inconvenient and a very difagreeable inftrument: inconvenient, for in a compafs of feven firings only, the firft muft be feven times as long as the laft; and difagreable, becaufe this firft firing will be feven times as loud alfo; fo that when the tones are to be played in a different order, loud and foft founds Of Mufical would be intermixed with moft difgufting alternations. Sonndii' In order to improve the firft inftrument, therefore, fucceeding muficians very judicioufly threw in all the other firings between the two firft, or, in other words, between the two OClaves, giving to each, however, the fame proportion to what it would have had in the firft natural inftrument. This made the inftrument more portable, and the founds more even and pleafing. They therefore difpofed the founds between the Odtave in their natural order, and gave each its own proportional di- menfions. Of thefe founds, where the proportion be¬ tween any two of them is moft obvious, the concord between them will be moft pleafing. Thus Octaves, which are as two to one, have a moft harmonious effect; the fourth and fifth alfo found fweetly together, and they will be found, upon calculation, to bear the fame proportion to each other that O(Staves do. “ Let it “ not be fuppofed, (fays Mr. Saveur) that the mufi- “ calfcale is merely an arbitrary combination of founds: “ it is made up from the confonance and differences of “ the parts which compofe it. Thofe who have often “ heard a fourth and a fifth accord together, will be “ naturally led to difeover their difference at once; and “ the mind unites itfelf to their beauties.” Let us then ceafe to affign the coincidences of vibrations as the caufe of harmony, fince thefe coincidences in two firings vi¬ brating at different intervals, muft at beft be but fortui¬ tous ; whereas concord is always pleafing. The true caufe why concordis pleafing, muft arife from ourpower, in fuch a cafe, of meafuring more eafily the differences of the tones. In proportion as the note can be meafured with its fundamental tone by large and obvious diftinc- tiens, then the concord is moft pleafing; on the con¬ trary, when the ear meafures the diferiminations of two tones by very fmall parts, or cannot meafure them at all, it lofes the beauty of their refemblance: the whole is difeord and pain (c)",Of,TR,2,Turkey,Asia

The fmoke which arofe from this immenfe fire was fo thick, that the locufts, in crofting the valley, were ftifled by it, and fell in heaps on the ground.

"As to the folution of aenigmas, it may be obfer- ved, that thofe exprefled by figures are more difficult to explain than thofe confifting of words, by reafon images may fignify more things than words can; fo that to fix them to a particular fenfe, we muft apply every fituation, fymbol, fee. and without omitting a circumftance.—As there are few perfons in hiftory, or mythology, but have fome particular charadler of vice or virtue, we are, before all things, to attend to this charatter, in order to divine what the figure of a per¬ fon reprefented in a painting fignifies, and to find what agreement this may have with the fubject whereof we would explain it. Thus, if Proteus be reprefented in a pifture, it may be taken' to denote inconjlancy, and applied either to a phyfical or moral fubjedt, whofe character is to be changeable; e. g. an almanack, which exprefies the weather, the feafons, heat, cold, ftorms, and the like. The colours of figures may alfo help to unriddle what they mean : white, for inftance, is a mark of innocence, red of modefty, green of hope, black of forrovv, &c.

The force by which thefe ftones are projefted, as well as their magnitude, feems to be in proportion to the bulk of the mountain.

The out-lands were thofe at a greater diftance from the houfe, and were let to the ceorls, or farmers of thofe times, at very moderate rents. - By the laws of Ina king of the weft Saxons, w'ho reigned in the end of the feventli and begin¬ ning of the eight century, a farm, confifting of ten, hides, or plough-lands, w'as to pay the following rent: “ Ten calks of honey ; three hundred loaves of bread; “ twelve calks of ftrong ale; thirty calks of fmall ale; “ two oxen; ten wedders: ten geefe; twenty hens ; “ ten cheefes ; one calk of butter; five falmon ; twen- “ ty pounds of forage; and one hundred eels.” From this low rent the imperfection of agriculture at that time is eafily difcoverable ; but it is ftill more fo from the low prices at which land was then fold. In the ancient hiftory of the church of Ely, publilhed by Dr Gale, there are accounts of-many purchafes of lands by iEdel wold the founder of that church, and by other benefaCtors, in the reign of Edgar the Peaceable, in the tenth century. By a comparifon of thefe ac¬ counts it appears, that the ordinary price of an acre of the beft land in that part of England, in thofe times, was no more than 16 Saxon pennies, or about four Ihillings of our money ; a very trifling price, even in comparifon of that of other commodities at the fame time: for, by comparing other accounts, it appears, that four Iheep were then equal in value to an acre of the beft land, and one horfe of the fame value with three acres. The frequent and deplorable famines which afflifted England about this time, are further Inftances of the wretched ftate of agriculture. In 1043, a quarter of wheat fold for 60 Saxon pennies, (15 of our Ihillings) and at that time equal in value to feven or eight pounds of our money now",Ina,JP,2,Japan,Asia

The foil muft be highly cultivated for flax as well grain» as for red clover.

At the fame time, barley com¬ monly is fooner cut than either oats or wheat. In a word, barley is rather a nurfe than a ftepmother to clover during its infancy. When clover is fown in fpring upon wheat, the foil, which has lain five or fix months without being ftirred, is an improper bed for it; and the wheat, being in the vigour of growth, overtops it from the beginning.

"Natural allegiance is fuch as is due from all men born within the king’s dominions immediately upon their birth. For, immediately upon their birth, they are un¬ der the king’s proteftion; at a time too, when (during their infancy) they are incapable of protefting them- felves. Natural allegiance is, therefore, a debt of gra¬ titude; which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or alter¬ ed, by any change of time, place, or circumftance, nor by any thing but the united concurrence of the legifla- ture.

They have long footftalks, which come out horizontally, fo that the flowers hang downward. They are tubulous, and cut into fix unequal fegments to thedbottom, three be¬ ing alternately broader than the others.

The leaves of this fort are about four inches broad at their bafe, where they are near two inches thick, and diminifir gradually to a point, having a few indentures on their edges, and when young are fpotted with white. The flower-ftem rifes near three feet high. The flowers ftand in a flender loofe fpike with very fhort footftalks, hanging down¬ wards.

Thofe who live in a high country are fairer than thofe in the marftiy low lands on the coaft. Their face is round; farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people, from an oval fhape. Their fore-head is fmall; the ex¬ tremity of their ears far from the face; their lips thick; their nofe flat; their eyes black, or of a cheftnut colour, fmall, but capable of difcerning objedts at a great di¬ ftance.

At the firft afpedl, a South-American appears to be mild and innocent; but, on a more attentive view, one difcovers in his coun¬ tenance fomething wild, diftruftful, and fullen.” The Americans were alfo remarkable for their de¬ bility of body.

"At the fame time they found it impoffible to keep the Indians together. On their firft feeling of the climate, their thoughts were immediately turned on deferting their mafters. The firft inftance they had of this kind was fo unexpe&ed, that, had not one, of a better difpofition than the reft, ftaid and acquainted them of their defign, it might have proved of very bad confequence. The affair was this : There being on the top of the rock no room for pitching a tent for the In¬ dians, they ufed every evening to retire to a cave at the foot of the mountain ; where, befide a natural diminu¬ tion of the cold, they could keep a continual fire; and, confequently, enjoyed more comfortable quarters than their mafters. Before they withdrew at night> they faftened, on the outfide, the door of the hut, which was fo low that it was impoffible to go in or out without ftooping ; and as every night the hail and fnow which had fallen formed a wall againft the door, it was the bufinefs of one or two of the Indians to come early and remove this obftru&ion. For though the negro fervants were lodged in a little tent, their hands and feet were fo E e e 3 covered AND [ 408 ] AND covered with chilblains, that they would rather have fuffered themfelves to have been killed than move. The Indians therefore came conftantly up to difpatch this work betwixt nine or ten in the morning : but they had not been there above four or five days, when they were not a little alarmed to fee ten, eleven, and twelve o’clock come, without any news of their labourers; when they were relieved by thehoneft fervant mentioned above, who had withftood the feduftion of his countrymen, and informed his matters of the defertion of the four ethers.

"“ Hhallgiveyouwhatparticulars Irecolleft with regard to my furprifing friend.—I was then in company with feveral Englilh gentlemen : we were introduced to the automaton’s chamber: The machine was a well-dreffed Turkifh figure as large as life, feated at a fquare table, or rather box (as it was clofe on all fides), furrounded at a little diftance by a rail, within which no perfon en¬ tered but the proprietor (an independent gentleman of Prelburg.) The chefs-board feemed fixed to the table, which was fo placed, that any perfon from w-ithout the rail could play on it. Before the game began, the pro¬ prietor opened the fides of the table, and the body of the Turk; but nothing was to be feen but wheels upon wrheels. He then woundup the machine (this herepeated once during the game.) A gentleman of our company was his antagonift; and as he was but a wooden Turk, he gave him the firft move. I do not underftand the game; but thofe prefent who did, faid he played very w'ell. The game wasleftunfiniflied,as all therewere fully fatisfied that this wooden Turk did play the game ; but no one dared hazard a guefs on what principle, or who directed. His right hand, with which he made all his moves, had the fingers as it were drawn together, which he opened and clofed at pleafure when he remo¬ ved any of his men. His face had a ferious caft; which, added to a gray'e {hake of the head when any difficulty arofe in the game, had a moft ridiculous effedl: on the contrary, when his adverfary laid himfelf open, his mo¬ tions were quicker; and when he made a falfe ftroke (which he did on purpofe), he immediately remo¬ ved the man off the board with which the ftroke was made. I forgot to mention, that within the rail, at the diftance of fome feet from the machine, there flood F f f 2 n Amlroicpfy II Andromeda AND [ 4*6 ] AND a fmall fquare box on a fto'ol, which apparently had no connection with the machine, but which the proprietor faid he mull have opened had it gone wrong. I imagi¬ ned I heard a noife in the box like that occaJioned by the turning of wheels.—His arm moved horizontally, at a height fo as not to difcompofe the men. When his hand came over the man he wanted to move, he open¬ ed his fingers, let it down, clofed them on the man, lifted him up and carried him off the board, fet him down, and laid his arm down upon the table.”  As the inventor of this admirable piece of mechanifm hath not yet thought proper to communicate to the public the means by which it is aftuated, it is in vain for any, except thofe who are exquifitely (killed in me¬ chanics, to form conjeftures concerning them.—Many other curious imitations of the human body, as well as that of other animals, have been exhibited, though none of them equal to the laft mentioned one.

They who were left behind in the ftiip, finding Xifuthrus, and the perfons that accompanied him, did not return, went out themfelves to feek for him, calling him aloud by his name: but Xifuthrus was no more feen by them; only a voice came out of the air, which enjoined them, as their duty was, to be re¬ ligious ; and informed them, that, on account of his own piety, he was gone to dwell with the gods; and that his wife, and daughter, and pilot, were partakers of the fame honour.

Antonides took great pleafure in reading the Latin poets, and carefully compared them with Gro- tius, Heinfius, &c. By this means he acquired a tafte for poetry, and enriched his mind with noble ideas. He firft attempted to tranflate fome pieces of Ovid, Horace, and other ancients; and, having formed his tafte on thefe excellent models, he at length undertook one of the moft difficult tafks in poetry, to write a tragedy: this was intitled Traz'd, or The Invajion of China.

"In the year 170, Antoninus made vaft preparations againft the Germans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is faid to have happened, which, according to Dion Caflius, was as follows: Antoninus’s army being block¬ ed up by the Quadi, in a very difadvantageous place, where there was no poffibility of procuring water; in this fituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppreffed with heat and thirft, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an inftant the Iky was co¬ vered with clouds, and there fell a vaft quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thirft, when the enemy came upon them with fuch fury, that Antoninus they muft certainly Lave been defeated, had it not been for a fliower of hail, accompanied with a ftorm of thun¬ der and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the leaft annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the vidfory (b). ^In 175, Antoninus made a .treaty with feveral nations of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Caffius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor : this infurreftion, however, was put an end to by the death of Caflius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards thofe who had been engaged in Caflius’s p^r- ty : he would not put to death, nor imprifon, nor even fit in judgment himfelf upon any of the fenators enga- ed in this revolt; but he referred them to the fenate, xing a day for their appearance, as if it had been on¬ ly a civil affair. He wrote alfo to the fenate, defiririg them to a£b with indulgence rather than feverity; not to filed the blood of any fenator or perfon of quality, or of any other perfon whatfoever, but to allow this ho¬ nour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loft their lives, except in the firft heat of the tumult. In 176, Antoninus vifited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thofe countries, and ambaf- fadors alfo from Parthia, came to vifit him. He ftaid feyeral days at Smyrna; and, after he had fettled the affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his fon Commodus, whom, he chofe conful for the year fol¬ lowing, though he was then but 16 years of age, ha¬ ving obtained a difpenfation for that purpofe. On the 27th of September, the fame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commodus, on account of the vi&ories gained over the Germans. Dion Caflius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himfelf and the public treafury during 46 years, from the time that Hadrian had granted the fame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thofe debts. He applied himfelf likewife to correct many enormities, and introduced feveral excellent regulations. In the year 179, he left Rome with his fon Commodus, in order to go againft the Marcomanni, and other barba¬ rous nations; and the year following gained a confider- able vi&ory over them, and would, in all probability, have entirely fubdued them in a very ftiort time, had he not been taken with an illnefs, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign.

At the bottom, on one fide, ran the river Indus ; on the top was a fine plain, part of which was covered with a thick wood; the reft arable land, with a fountain furniftiing abundance of excellent water. This rock was taken by Alexander the Great, in whofe time there was a report that Hercules had at¬ tempted it in vain; however, according to Arrian, this report was without foundation. It is probable indeed, that it was raifed after the place was taken, in order to magnify Alexander’s exploit. While the Macedo¬ nian monarch was preparing all things neceffary for the fiege, an old man with his two fons, who had long li¬ ved in a cave near the fummit, came and offered to (hew him a private way of afcending. This being readily accepted, Ptolemy, with a confiderable body of light¬ armed troops, was difpatched with them, with orders, in cafe they fucceeded, to entrench themfelves ftrongly upon the rock, in the wood to which the old man was to dirett them, before they ventured to attack the In¬ dians. Ptolemy exadtly executed his orders; and gave notice by a lighted torch fet upon a pole, that he had got fafely up. Upon this, Alexander gave immediate orders for a body of troops to attempt the paffage by which the rock was commonly afcended; but they were repulfed with great (laughter.

"Of the Drones are fmaller than the queen, and larger than drones. wor]i;ng bees; and in flying they make a greater noife. If a hive is opened in the beginning of fpring, not a Angle drone will be found in it; from the middle of May to the end of June, hundreds of them will be found, commonly from 200 or 300 to 1000 ; and from thence to the following fpring, it would be in vain to feek for them. They go not out till 11 in the mor¬ ning, and return before Ax in the evening. To live, feems to be their only bufinefs ; yet their difleftion in¬ forms us that they have the male parts of generation, and obfervations have aflured us that they couple with the queen. While their prefence is thus neceflary for the queen, or whilft, in the opinion of many, their warmth is neceflary to cherifh the young, they are fuffered to enjoy the fweets of love and life; but as foon as they become ufelefs in the hive, the working bees declare the moft cruel war againft them, and make terrible flaughter of them.

"Of the In the plan and formation of thefe cells, they difeo- copibs. ver a moq wonderful fagacity. In conftrufting habita¬ tions within a limited compafs, an architeft would have three objefts in view: firlt, to ufe the fmalleft quantity that can be of materials; next, to give to the edifice the greateft capacity on a determined fpace ; and third¬ ly, to employ the fpot in fuch a manner that none of it may be loft. On examination, it will be found that the bees have obtained all thefe advantages in the hex¬ agonal form of their cells: for, firft, there is an (eco¬ nomy of wax, as the circumference of one cell makes part of the circumferences of thofe contiguous to it; fecondly, the (economy of the fpot, as thefe cells which join to one another leave no void between them; and thirdly, the greateft capacity or fpace ; as, of all the figures which can be contiguous, that with fix fides gives the largeft area. This thriftinefs prompts them to make the partitions of their cells thin ; yet they are conftrudted fo as that the folidity may compenfate for the fcantinefs of materials. The parts moft liable to injury are the entrance of the cells. Thefe the bees take care to ftrengthen, by adding quite round the circumference of the apertures a fillet of wax, by which jneans this mouth is three or four times thicker than I>he fides: and they are ftrengthened at the bottom by the angle formed by the bottom of three cells falling in the middle of an oppofite cell. The combs lie pa¬ rallel to each other; and there is left between every one of them, a fpace which ferves as a ftreet, broad e- nough for two bees to pafs by each other. There are holes which go quite through the combs, and ferve as lanes for the bees to pafs from one comb to another, without being obliged to go a great way about. When they begin their combs, they form at the top of the hive a root or flay to the whole edifice, which is to hang from it. Though they generally lay the foun- 2 ] API dations of the combs fo that there fhall be no more Apis, between them than what is fufficient for two bees to or Bee- pafs, yet they fometimes place thofe beginings of two ‘ combs too far afunder; and, in this cafe, in order to fill up part of the void fpace arifing from that bad difpo- fition, they carry their combs on obliquely, to make them gradually approach each other. This void fpace is fometimes fo confiderable, that the bees build in it an intermediate comb, which they terminate as foon as the original combs have only their due diftances. As the combs would be apt, when full, to overcome by their weight all the fecurity which the bees can give them againft falling; they who prepare hives, fet in them, croffwife, fticks, which ferve as props to the combs, and fave the bees a great deal of labour. It is not eafy to difeover the particular manner of their working ; for, notwithftanding the many contrivances ufed for this purpofe, there are fuch numbers in continual motion, and fucceed one another with fuch rapidity, that no¬ thing but confufion apears to the fight. Some of them, however, have been obferved carrying pieces of wax in their talons, and running to the places where they are at work upon the combs. Thefe they faften to the work by means of the fame talons. Each bee is em¬ ployed but a very fhort time in this way : but there is fo great a number of them that go on in a conftant fucceflion, that the comb increafes very perceptibly",Of,TR,2,Turkey,Asia

"Where the winters are extremely fevere, the authors of the Maijon Rujiique advife, to lay on the bottom of an old cade the depth of half a foot of very dry earth, powdered, and prefled down hard, and to fet on this the (tool with the hive; then, to preferve a communication with the air, which is abfolutely neceflary, to cut a hole in the calk, oppofite to the mouth of the hive, and place a piece of reed, or of alder made hollow, from the mouth of the hive to the hole in the calk; and after this to cover the hive with more of the fame dry earth.

In this country it Methods of is ufual, in feizing the (tores of thefe little animals, to rob them alfo of their lives. The common method thTwax."" is, That when thofe which are doomed for (laughter Common have been marked out (which is generally done in method in September), a hole is dug near the hive, and a (lick,thls coufl* at the end of which is a rag that has been dipped try' in melted brimftone, being (tuck in that hole, the rag is fet on fire, the hive is immediately fet over it, and the earth is inftantly thrown up all around, fo that none of the fmoke can efcape. In a quarter of an hour, all the bees are feemingly dead; and they will foon after be irrecoverably fo, by being buried in the earth that is returned back into the hole. By this lafl: means it is that they are abfolutely killed: for it has been found by experiment, that all the bees which have been affeCted only by the fume of the brimftone, reco¬ ver again, excepting fuch as have been finged or hurt by the flame. Hence it is evident, that the fume of brimftone might be ufed for intoxicating the bees, with fome few precautions.

"Mahomet now entered upon his apoftolic funftion with uncommon diligence and application; and foon gained over his uncle Hamza, and Omar Ebn A1 Khattah, a perfon very much efteemed, and who be¬ fore had been his violent oppofer. Notwithftanding this fuccefs, however, the Koreiih continued their op- pofition, and came to a refolution to profcribe all who had embraced Mahomet’s doctrine. In confequence of this refolution, the Mojlems, as his followers were cal¬ led, were now treated with fuch feverity, that they found it no longer fafe to continue in Mecca ; nay, feveral of them in the fifth year of his million found themfelves obliged to fly into Ethiopia, where they were kindly received by the Najafhi or king of that country, who refufed to deliver them up to thofe whom the Koreiih fent to demand them. At this refufal they were fo ex- afperated, that they came to a refolution to fupprefs effe&ually the new religion which had now made a confiderable progrefs. In order to this, they entered into a folemn league or covenant againft the Halher mites, and the family of Abdal Motalleb in particu¬ lar, engaging themfelves to contraft no marriages with them, nor to have any manner of communication with them otherwife ; and, to give this the greater weight, they reduced it into writing,, and laid it up in the Caaba. Upon this, the tribe became divided into two fadtions ; and all the family of Halhem, both Mof- lems and unbelievers, repaired to Abu Taleb as their head; except only Abdal Uzza, furnamed Abu La- heb, the fon of Abdal Motalleb, who, out of hatred to his nephew and his do&rine, went over to the op- pofite party. After this the authority of Abu Taleb was fcarce fufficient to protect Mahomet from the fury of the Koreiih ; who, according to A1 Jannabi, made frequent attempts upon him ; fometimes endeavouring to deftroy him by force, at other times by fecret wiles and machinations: nay, to compafs their end, he tells us that they had recourfe to magic, inchantments, and diabolical illufions.

"After this memorable event Mahomet remained with his uncle Abu Taleb, who furvived the reconciliation only about eight months. The fame year alfo died Khadijah, Mahomet’s wife. Her death, as well as that of his uncle, proved a great detriment to his affairs ; for the Koreiih, notwithftanding the former reconcilia- 35 tion, began now to profecute him with more violence Mahomet than ever.

In this, how¬ ever, he found himfelf miftaken; and though he ftaid a month in the city, during which time he gained over a few, yet at laft the lower fort of people rofe againft him and obliged him to return to Mecca. This refu¬ fal, though it greatly difcouraged the new converts, did not in the leaft abate the zeal of Mahomet : on the contrary, he continued to preach boldly to the public affemblies at the pilgrimage to Mecca, exclaiming a- gainft idolatry, and particularly againft the worlhip of two idols Allat and A1 Uzza, to which the tribes, e- fpecially the women of that of Thakif, were very much addi&ed. By this the prophet was often expofed to great danger : however, he gained fome converts, and amongft them fix of the inhabitants of Yathreb, of the Jewilh tribe of Khazraj ; who, on their return home, failed not to fpeak much in commendation of their new religion, and exhorted their fellow-citizens imme- 3(j diately to embrace it. Thefe converts of the tribe of Anfars, wh» Khazraj are by the Arab writers called Al Anfar, Al Anfarii, or Atifars; that is, afliftants, favourers, fup- porters, &c. becaufe they aflifted and fupported the prophet when he was purfued to the very brink of de- ftru&ion. They firft met Mahomet on a little hill cal¬ led Al Akaba, where a temple ftood, and where they firft took an oath to exert themfelves in fupport of their new apoftle and his religion. An uninterrupted friend- ‘fhip and harmony reigned for a long time amongft the members of the Jewifh tribes of Khazraj, Koreidha, and Nadir, whofe great progenitor, fay the Arabs, was Aaron the fon of Amran. Mahomet therefore infinuating himfelf into the good graces of the An- fars, they readily embraced his religion, and proved of very confiderable fervice. ^ The next remarkable thing recorded of Mahomet is Mahomet’s the invention of his night-journey to heaven. This he journey t* probably intended to fupply the place of miracles; heaven"" which, being performed by all other prophets, would no doubt have been confidered as a capital defeat in Maho¬ met’s million, had they been totally wanting. The abfurdities contained in that relation, however, are fo great, that when he related it to his uncle Al Abbas, and Omm Hana the daughter of Abu Taleb, they en¬ deavoured A R A [ S54 ] A R A Arabia, deavoured to difluade him from making it public. This thcrto he had propagated his religion by fair means on- Arabia ' advice he was fo far from following, that he related the whole to Abu Jahl, one of his moft inveterate enemies, who ridiculed him for it. Nay, he placed this ftory in fuch a ridiculous light to the Koreifh, that they were on the point of infulting him ; feveral of his followers left him; and the whole defign had probably been ruin- tTof hi« ech had not Abu Beer vouched for his veracity, and oi ms  .  ..    ^   i ly; and in feveral paffagesof the Koran, which hepre- ' tended were revealed before this time, he declared, that his bufinefs was only to preach and admonilh ; that he had no authority to compel any perfon ; and that whether they believed or not, was none of his concern, but belonged folely to God. But no fooner did he find himfelf enabled, by the alliance abovementioned, to caufe. declared, that, if Mahomet affirmed it to be true, he refill his enemies, than he gave out that God had ah firmly believed the whole. This happy incident not only retrieved the prophet’s credit, but increafed it to fuch a degree, that he was fure of making his difciples fwallow whatever he pleafed ; and on this occafion it is lowed him and his followers to defend themfelves ; and at length, as his forces increafed, he pretended not only to have leave to a£l on the defenfive, but to attack the infidels, deftroy idolatry, and fet up the true re¬ faid by fome that he gave Abu Beer the name of the ligion by the power of thefword.

But what moft e- ftablifhed the impoftor’s affairs, and was indeed the true foundation of all his future greatnefs, was his gain¬ ing the battle of Bedr, of which we have the follow¬ ing account. The prophet being informed that Abu Sofian Ebn Harb efcorted a caravan of the Koreifh with only 30 or 40 men, refolved to advance at the head of a fmall detachment of his troops to intercept it. To this he was excited by the riches of the cara¬ van, which confifted of a large quantity of merchan¬ dize, confifting of the riches of Syria, carried on the backs of a thoufand camels. He therefore fent out a party to reconnoitre it, with orders to wait in fome convenient place, where they might remain undifeo- vered. But Abu Sofian having notice of Mahomet’s motions, difpatched a courier to Mecca, requefling fuccours from his countrymen, that he might be able to Thefe overtook them ; and, as the Arab hiftorians tell us, Soraka’s horfe fell down when he attempted to feize Mahomet. Upon this he recommended himfelf to the prophet’s prayers, and remounted his horfe without hurt : but, as he ftill continued the purfuit, his horfe fell down with him a fecond time; upon which he re¬ turned to Mecca, without offering any further violence; and Mahomet, thus happily delivered from the greateft dangers, arrived without further moleftation at Medina, where he was received with the greateft demonftrations of joy.—This flight of the prophet from Mecca to Me¬ dina was reckoned fo remarkable by the Mcflems, that they made it the sera from whence all their remarkable tranfa&ions were dated; calling it the Mr a c,f the Hegira, or flight.

"On Mahomet’s arrival at Mecca, his firft care was to build a mofque for his religious worfhip, and an houfe for himfelf. The city of Medina at that time was inha¬ bited partly by Jews, and partly by heretical Chriftians, that formed two factions which perfecuted one another with great violence. This gave the impoftor fuch an opportunity of propagating his new religion, that in a fhort time the city was entirely at his devotion.

"and gave his own daughter Fatima in marriage to Ali the foh of AbuTaleb. The next point he had in view was the union of the Mohajerin, or thofe who fled from Mecca on account of their religion, with the Anfars a- bove mentioned. To facilitate this, after his mofque and houfe were finifhed, he eftablifhed among the Mof¬ lems a fraternity, the principal ftatute of which was, that they Ihould not only treat one another like bre¬ thren, but likewife moft cordially love and mutually eherifti one another to the utmoft of their power. But, left even this fhould prove infufficient, he coupled the individuals of the two bodies of A nfars and Mohajerin ; and this was the laft tranfadlion of the firft year of the Hegira",Mecca,SA,2,Saudi Arabia,Asia
"Mahomet, in the mean time, taking advantage of this lucky event, offered up his prayers to God with great fervency and vehemence ; after which, feigning himfelf in a trance, he pretended that God had affured him of victory. Then, throwing an handful of dull or gravel towards the enemy, he cried out, “ May the faces of them be confounded;” and attacked the Koreifti with fuch bravery, that they were foon put to flight, leaving 70 dead on the fpot, and having as many taken pri- foners. The lofs on Mahomet’s fide was only 14 men, and among the prifoners was A1 Abbas the prophet’s Jerufalem, probably with a view to ingratiate himfelf with the Jews ; and now, in order to gain the Pagan Arabs, he ordered his followers to pray with their fa¬ ces towards the eaft.

Nay, notwithftanding the fmall number of enemies to be overcome, and who were only mortal men, thefe ignorant bigots did not hefitate to own the affiftance of no lefs than four thou- fand angels, who, according to them, rode on black and white horfes, having on their heads white and yellow falhes, that hung down between their fhoulders! Notwithftanding this difafter, however, Abu Sofian made a pretty good retreat, and conducted the greateft part of the caravan to Mecca. This chagrined the Moflems, though they found great fpoils on the field of battle, the divifion of which had likely to have proved fatal to their caufe, by the quarrels that it oc- cafioned among them.

This became a law for his fucceffors; but, with regard to himfelf, the prophet often took the liberty of infringing it; for which, no doubt, a new revelation was always a ready and convenient falvo. As for thofe who were flain on Mahomet's part in this battle, they were all looked upon by the Moflems as martyrs; and the prophet per¬ ceiving among the prifoners two of his inveterate ene¬ mies, immediately caufed their heads to be ftruck off",Mecca,SA,2,Saudi Arabia,Asia
"The Koreilh, in order to be revenged on Mahomet for their late defeat at Bedr, fent Amru Ebn A1 As, who afterwards conquered Egypt, with fome other of their principal people, on an embaffy to the king of Ethiopia, in order to intereft him in their quarrel. To do this the more effe&ually, they accufed Mahomet and his followers of fpeaking difrefpe&fully of Jesus, and of his mother Mary ; which accufation they ho¬ ped would likewife induce him to deliver up the Mof- lem refugees that were then at his court. But the bad fuccefs that had attended the arms of the Koreifti hi¬ therto, joined to the excufes made by the refugees, not only hindered the Najafhi from delivering them up, but alfo prompted him to difinifs the ambafladors, and return the prefents they had brought him. In the mean time, Abu Sofian, who had fworn never to ufe perfumes or enjoy women till he had another battle with Mahomet, fet out from Mecca with a body of two hundred horfe. He advanced to a poft within three miles of Medina; from whence he fent a detachment, who burnt a barn, together with a man in it that was winnowing wheat.

He diftri- buted three ftandards among his troops ; of which one was given to the tribe of Aws, another to that of Khazraj, and the third to the Mphajerin. The grand ftandard was carried before the prophet by Mofaab Ebn Omair. With thefe forces Mahomet formed a Battle of camp in a village near Ohod, a mountain about four Ohod",Of,TR,2,Turkey,Asia

Ali, or, according to Abul- feda, Hamza, flew Arta the enemy’s great ftandard- bearer; which ftruck them with fuch terror, that they foon betook themfelves to flight, falling foul upon their own corps de referve. Victory had now been no longer doubtful, notwithftanding the vaft inferiori¬ ty of Mahomet’s troops, had not the 50 archers, con¬ trary to the prophet’s exprefs commands, quitted their poft to pillage the enemy. Upon this, Khaled per¬ ceiving the Moflem army to be greatly expofed, at¬ tacked them in the rear with fuch bravery, that he turned the fortune of the day. Not content with put¬ ting the troops there in diforder, he cried out with all his might “ Mahomet is flain and this had fuch an effeft upon the Moflems, that they immediately took to their heels, nor could the utmoft endeavours of the prophet himfelf afterwards rally them. He therefore Mahomet found himfelf obliged to quit the field of battle, in defeated, doing which he was very near lofing his life; being ftruck down by a ffiower of ftones, and wounded in the face by two arrrows, which occafioned the lofs of two of his fore-teeth. He likewife received a contu- fion on his upper lip ; and had even been killed on the fpot, had not one of his companions, named Telha, Abu Beer’s nephew, received a blow that was levelled at him. On this occafion Telha received a wound in his hand, which deprived him ever after of the ufe of fome of his fingers.

The good retreat made by thefe champions fo difeouraged the troops of Abu Sofian, that they did not purfue the flying ^nemy, but contented themfelves with remaining matters of the field of battle ; nor did that general, tho’ he exulted not a little in his vi&ory, make any further ufe of it than to give Mahomet a challenge to meet him the next year at Bedr, which was accepted ; and after his return to Mecca, he defired a truce with the Modems, which was readily granted","Of, Mecca","TR,SA",2,"Turkey,Saudi Arabia","Asia,Asia"

In 628, . he fent an agent to Conftantinqple, defiring leave of the Greek emperor to trade with his fubjeifrs ; which was immediately granted. The fame year alfo he conclu¬ ded a peace for ten years with the inhabitants of Mecca, and obtained liberty the next year to perform his devo¬ tions at the Caaba. • What tended confiderably to bring about this pacification was an account brought to the a Koreifh by one whom they had fent with an adlual de- Prodigious fiance to Mahomet, of the prodigious veneration which f^rMaho'1 his followers had for him.

This intimated how defpe- rately they would fight in his defence, and probably inclined his enemies to avoid hoftilities.

"This was done by communicating fome poifon to a (houlder of mutton, of which one of his companions na¬ med Bajhar Ebn Al Bara, eating heartily, died upon the fpot; and Mahomet himfelf, though he recovered a little, and lived three years after, yet never enjoyed perfect health. Notwithstanding this misfortune, how¬ ever, he itill continued his enterprizes. The year 630 proved remarkably fortunate.

Upon this, he applied to Abu Beer, AH, Omar, and Fatima, to intercede for their countrymen with the prophet ; but fome of thefe giving him rough anfwers, and others none at all, he was obliged to re¬ turn to Mecca as he came.

Then he entered the Caaba, where obferving feveral idols in the form of angels, and the ftatues of Abraham and Khmael with the arrows of divination in their hands, he caufed them all to be de- ftroyed. He alfo broke in pieces with his own hands a wooden pigeon, that had long been efteemed a deity by the idolatrous Koreifh. Afterwards entering into the interior part of the Caaba, he repeated with a loud voice the form ufed at this day by the Mahometans, “ Allah Akbar, God is Great,” &c. turning towards every part of the temple. Then he prayed between the two pillars there, with two. inclinations, as well as without the Caaba ; faying to thofe that attended him, “ This is your Kebla, or the place towards which you are to turn your faces in prayer.” Having thus effeftually fubdued the Koreifh, put an end to all commotions, and purged the Caaba of 360 idols, the prophet’s next care was to ingratiate himfelf with the people.

After the conclufion of his fermon, he pitched his tent made of hair, within fight of the city.

"Soon after Omar’s departure, Yezid advanced to Cae- farea; but found the place fo ttrong, that he was obli¬ ged to continue fame time in a ftate of ina&ion. Abu Obeidah, in the mean time, advanced towards Aleppo, the citadel of which was at that time the ftrongeft in Syria. The citizens were {truck with the utmott con- fternation at his approach. They had at that time two governors, who were brothers, and refided in the cattle, which was fituated at a little diftance from the city",Aleppo,SY,2,Syrian Arab Republic,Asia
"The names of thefe two governors, who were of very- different difpofitions, were Youkinna and John. Their father, by the emperor Heraclius’s appointment, pre- fided over all that tradt which lay betwixt Aleppo and the Euphrates; and, after his death, the chief manage¬ ment of affairs devolved upon Youkinna, his brother John fpending his time moftly in devotion and adts of charity. He would therefore gladly have prevailed on Youkinna to purchafe a peace from the Arabs with money, rather than make his country a fcene of blood and ravages} but this not fuiting the martial genius of Youkinna, he armed a confiderable number of the ci¬ tizens, among whom were feveral Chriftian Arabs, and dittributed money among them. He then told his men that he intended to aft offenfively againft the Arabs, and even to engage them if pofiible before they drew too near. To infpire them with the greater refolution, he obferved, that the Moflem army was divided into fe¬ veral bodies; one of which had orders to befiege Cae- farea, another to march to Damafcus, and the third to invade Egypt.

"After Youkinna’s departure, the inhabitants of A~ leppo, confidering the calamities that awaited them if their city Ihould be taken by ftorm, fubmitted without delay to Abu Obeidah, and were taken under the pro- teftion of the khalif. This difagreeable news being communicated to Youkinna, he potted home with all poffible expedition, left an attempt ftiould be made on the cattle in his abfence. On his arrival at Aleppo, he was fo highly incenfed againft the inhabitants, that he threatened them with death if they did not difannul the treaty with the Arabs, and deliver up the authors of it into his hands. This demand not being immedi¬ ately complied with, he fell upon the citizens with great fury, and killed 300 of them; among whom was his brother John, whofe head he caufed to be ftruck off, charging him with being the author and abettor of the late pernicious fcheme. He would have made a much greater {laughter, had not the Moflem army at that inftant arrived before the town; upon which You¬ kinna retired into the cattle with a confiderable body of troops : but before this could be effefted, he was obliged to fuftain an attack from the Arabs, in which he loft 3000 men.

"Immediately after Youkinna had {hut himfelf up in the cattle, a council of war was held in the Moflem camp, wherein it was deliberated what meafures were to be purfued on the prefent occafion. Khaled gave it as his opinion, that the cattle ought immediately to be attacked with all the Arab forces, before the emperor had time to fend them any afliftance. This advice was followed by Abu Obeidah, who caufed the citadel to be immediately invefted, and foon after he had fur- rounded it with all his forces, made a moft vigorous af- fault. The befieged defended themfelves with great bravery, and after a very warm difpute drove the enemy into their camp; and as they threw a great many ftones out of their military engines, many of the Moflems were killed, and a much greater number wounded. This encouraged Youkinna to make a fally with a ftrong party of the garrifon the following night. The fires being then out in the Moflem camp, and the befiegers not expefting fuch an unfeafonable vifit, 60 of them were killed on the fpot, and 50 taken prifoners. You¬ kinna, however, being brifkly attacked by Khaled, who foon drew together a body of troops to oppofe him, loft about 100 men in his retreat. The next day, he caufed the prifoners to be beheaded in fight of the Moflem camp ; and, receiving advice that a ftrong party of A- rabian cavalry was fent out to forage, he ordered a body of his horfe to drive them to their camp ; which they accordingly did, killed 130 of them, feized all their camels, horfes, &c. and then retired to the moun¬ tains.

Having nothing material to write to the khalif, he remained a long time filent; at which O- mar being very much concerned, wrote to him, defi¬ ring an account of the affairs in Syria. Abu Obeidah acquainted him that the city of Aleppo had fubmitted to him ; and that the citadel was the only place which held out in all that country, before which he had loft a great number ©f men, which, he faid, had induced him to think of raifing the fiege, and moving with his ar¬ my in that track which lay between Antioch and A- leppo.

"takenCbtatlel Among the troops fent by Omar on this occafion, ftratagem t^iere w-35 an Arab of a gigantic fize, called Dames, who was a man of great courage and refolution. He obferving the little progrefs made by the Modems, be¬ thought himfelf of a ftratagem by which that fortrefs might be reduced, which feemed fo difficult to be ac- ■complifhed by force. He therefore defired that Abu Obeidah would affign him the command of a party con- fifting only of thirty men, which at Khaled’s requeft was readily granted. Then he begged the general to raife the fiege, and retire to about three miles diftance from the caftle, which was likewife immediately com¬ plied with. The following night Dames, who had ported himfelf with his party very near the citadel, found means to feize a Greek, from whom he learned that Youkinna, after the fiege was raifed, had exacted large fums of money from the citizens, on account of the treaty they had concluded with the Arabs; and that he was one of thofe who had endeavoured to make their efcape from the oppreffion of fuch a tyrant, by Ibaping down from the wall. This man Dames took underhis pro t eft ion; but beheaded five or fix others who fell into his hands, and could give no good account of themfelves. He then covered his head and fhoulders with a goat’s fkin, and took a dry cruft in his hand, creeping on the ground till he got clofe to the foot of the wall. If he heard any noife, or fufpefted any Arabia-, I perfon to be near, he made fuch a noife with his cruft ' f as a dog does when he is gnawing a bone ; his compa¬ nions fometimes walking, and fometimes creeping after him in the fame manner. He had before difpatched two of his men to Abu Obeidah, to defire that a de¬ tachment of horfe might be fent him by break of day, to fupport his fmall party, and facilitate the execution of the plan he had formed. At laft Dames found an opportunity of raifing feven men upon his thoul- ders, who flood one upon another’s (boulders in fuch a manner that the higheft reached the top of the wTall. Here he foon placed himfelf, feized a watch¬ man whom he found afleep, and threw him over the j wall. Two others, whom he found in the fame condi¬ tion, he ftabbed with his dagger, and threw them over likewife. Then he laid down his turbant, and drew up the fecond of his brethren, as they two did the third, and by their help Dames himfelf and all the reft were enabled to mount the wall. He then private¬ ly {tabbed the centry at each of the gates, and put his men in pofleffion of every one of them. The fol- diers of the garrifon, however, were at laft alarmed, and furrounded the Arabs, who were on the point of periling, when Khaled appeared at the head of a de¬ tachment of cavalry. On fight of that general, who was now grown terrible to the Chriftians, the befieged threw down their arms and furrendered at diferetion. 8j Youkinna and fome of the principal officers turned Youldnna’s Mahometans, in order to fave their poffeffions; and the aP°ftaer* caftle, being taken by ftorm, was pillaged by the Modems. Dames acquired great glory by this exploit; and, out of complaifance to him. the army did not de¬ camp from Aleppo till he and his men were perfeftly cured of their wounds",Aleppo,"SY,GR",2,"Syrian Arab Republic,Greece","Asia,Europe"
"After the reduftion of the citadel of Aleppo, Abu Obeidah intended to march to Antioch; hut was di¬ verted by Youkinna, who was now become a violent enemy to the Chriftians. He told the Modem gene¬ ral, that his conqueft of that part of the country would not be complete without the reduftion of Azaz, a place of great importance, where Theodorus, Youkin¬ na’s coufin-german, was commandant. This fortrefs he propofed to become mafter of, by putting himfelf at the head of 100 Arab horfe dreffed in the Greek habit, who were to attend him to Azaz. Upon his arrival there, he was to aflure Theodorus that he was ftill in reality a Chriftian, and had taken that opportunity to efcape from the Modem camp. But, to make his fto- ry more probable, Abu Obeidah was to fend after him a detachment of 1000 horfe, who were to purfue him as far as Morah, a village in the neighbourhood of Azaz, with orders to port themfelves there; from whence, if fuch a meafure Ihould be found neceffary, they might eafily advance to Azaz, to facilitate the conqueft of that place. To this fcheme Abu Obeidah agreed; but Youkinna with all his men were immedi¬ ately taken prifoners by Theodorus, who had been in¬ formed of the whole affair by a fpy in the Modem camp, who had fent him a letter by a pigeon. The fortrefs, however, was foon reduced, and Youkinna re- gg , gained his liberty ; but was foon after taken prifoner a He is takesw fecond time, and brought before his old mafter Hera- prifoner anqu clius, who then redded at Antioch.

"Though the two armies did not come to a general engagement, yet they had frequent fkirmilhes, in which the Arabs always got the better, and in fome the Greeks fuffered very confiderably. This, together with the fe- verity of the feafon, which was then uncommonly cold, fo deje&ed the foldiery, that they began to defert in great numbers. Conftantine therefore, finding his troops to diminiffi daily, and the Arabs to grow ftronger and ftronger, took the advantage of a tempeftuous night to efcape to Cssfarea, which Yezid had not been able to take, leaving his camp to be plundered by the enemy. SJ This city was foon after invefted by Amru; and at the Yonkinna fame time Youkinna, having made himfelf mafter of takes Tri- Tripoli by treachery, feized 50 fhips from Cyprus and P°^‘ Crete, which carried a fupply of arms and provifions for 4 B the A R A [ 566 ] A R A 'Arallia- the emperor’s troops and had entered the port with¬ out knowing that the Arabs were matters of the town",Tripoli,"CY,LY",2,"Cyprus,Libya","Asia,Africa"

The furrender of this city was followed by that of all the other cities and fortrefles in the province; and thus the Arabs drove the Greeks out of the whole country of Syria extend¬ ing from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates.

But this method of conveying corn proving too tedious and ex- penfive, he ordered him to clear the Amnis Trajanus of Ptolemy, now the Khalis, which runs from one end of Cairo to the other, of the fand and gravel with which it was choked. This he accordingly did, and by that means rendered the communication between Egypt and Arabia much more eafy than it had formerly been. p(j While the Arabs thus extended their conquefts in The Fer¬ tile weft, they were no lefs fuccefsful in the eaft.

To this formidable accufation the poor khalif pleaded guilty, and promifed to make all the re¬ paration in his power; but his condefcenfion only fer- ved to increafe the infolence of the rebels. They were however appeafed by Ali; and public tranquillity had undoubtedly been reftored, had it not been for Ayefha, one of Mahomet’s widows, who procured the deftruc- tion of the khalif by a fcheme truly worthy of the wife of fuch an huiband. That traitrefs, being defirous of raifing one of her favourites named Telha to the digni¬ ty of khalif, prevailed on Merwan thefecretary offtate to write a letter to the prefect of Egypt, enjoining him to put to death Mahomet Ebn Abu Beer, with whom it was fent, and who was to be his fucceffor.

Before this period, the Ruffian commodities were ufually conveyed to Narva, in the gulph of Finland: but the channel of trade was foon turned to Archangel, and this traffic the Englifh for fome time enjoyed without competition.

There are not want¬ ing, however, fome modern authors, who endeavour to deprive the ancients of what isjuftly their due, and will have every thing to be exaggerated which feems be¬ yond the power of modern princes to accomplifli. In this way M. Goguet remarkably diftinguiflies himfelff and that without giving any reafon at all, but merely 4 F 2 that / 6oo A R C H I T that he takes it into his head. Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effeft, that the walls of Babylon could have been 318 feet high, and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhew us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium, and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it mull contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiltorians, this immenfe mafs of building was fmifhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchednezzar, or whoever fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for ten years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as llrongly as it is faid to have been ; *for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly fo, amounting to 18,189,600 folid fathoms. When our author afterwards gafconades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power, tafte, and time, to finilh Verfailles, with all its defe&s, than to confiruA a pyramid, or e- re& an obelilk.” The genius, tafte, and time, we (hall not difpute ; but as the fame author confefles that 100,000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftruflion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time the abovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fome of the works of which M. Goguet boafts fo much.

"When the Arabs conquered Spain, they introduced a mode of architedlure which was juft the reverfe of the Gothic. This was as remarkable for its lightnefs as the Gothic was for its clumfinefs ; and the fantaftic genius of the Arabs difplayed itfelf in the great number of fuperfluous and unnatural ornaments wherewith it was loaded. Examples of this kind of building are extant in fome cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors, par¬ ticularly that of Burgos.

"This barbarous prince was furnifhed with refources unknown to all other monarchs, even to the moft abfo- lute defpotic tyrant. His fubjedls wouldproftrate them- felves at the foot of his throne, requefting to die by his hand or order, as a favour by which they were fure of palling into paradife. On them if danger made any impreffion, it was an emulation to prefs forward ; and if taken in any enterprife, they went to the place of ex¬ ecution with a magnanimity unknown to others. Hen¬ ry count of Champaigne, who married Ifabella daugh¬ ter of Amaury king of Jerufalem, palling over part of the territory of the Afi'affins in his way to Syria, and talking highly of his power, their chief came to meet him, “ Ai-e your fubje&s (faid the old man of the mountain) as ready in their fubmiffion as mine?” and, without Haying for an anfwer, made a fign with his hand, when ten young men in white, who were Hand¬ ing on an adjacent tower, inftantly threw themfelves down. On another occafion, Sultan Malek-Shah fummoning the Scheik to fubmit himfelf to his govern¬ ment, and threatening him with the power of his arms, Ihould he hefitate to comply; the latter, very com- pofedly turning himfelf towards his guards, faid to one of them, “ Draw your dagger, and plunge it into your breaftand to another, “ Throw yourfelf headlong from yonder rock.” His orders were no fooner utter¬ ed, than they were joyfully obeyed : and all the anfwer he deigned to give the fultan’s envoy was, “ Away to thy mafter, and let him know I have many thoufand fubjefts of the fame difpofition.” Men fo ready to de- ftroy themfelves were equally alert and refolute in being the minifters of death to others. At the command of their fovereign, they made no difficulty of ftabbing any prince, even on his throne; and being well verfed in the different diale&s, they conformed to the drefs and even the external religion of the country, that they might with lefs difficulty ftrike the fatal blow required by their chief. With the Saracens they were Maho¬ metans ; with the Franks, Chriftians; in one place they joined with the Mamaluks; in another, with the eccle- fiaftics or religious; and under this difguife, feized the firft opportunity of executing their fanguinary commif- fion.

Being one day, with a few attendants, and they at fome diftance, reconnoi¬ tring the place for the better difpofition of the attack, a man rumed on him with a dagger in his hand, and wounded him in the head; but the fultan, as he was endeavouring to repeat his ftroke, wrefted the dagger from him, and, after receiving fevera! wounds, laid him dead at his feet. Before the fultah had well recovered himfelf, a fecond encountered him to finilh the treache¬ ry of the former; but he met with the fame fate : he was fucceeded with equal fury by a third, who alfo fell by the hand of that magnanimous prince whom he was fent to affaffmate. And it was obferved, that thefe wretches dealt about their fruitlefs blows as they lay in the agonies of death. With fuch rapidity was this tranfafted, that it was over before Saladin’s guards could come to his affiftance.
