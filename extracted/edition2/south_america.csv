"ACADEMICS, or Academists, a denomination given to the cultivators of a fpecies of philofophy ori¬ ginally derived from Socrates, and afterwards illu- ftrated and enforced by Plato, who taught in a grove near Athens, confecrated to the memory of Academus an Athenian hero; from which circumftance this phi¬ lofophy received the name of academical. Before the days of Plato, philofophy had, in a great meafure, fallen into contempt. The contradictory fyftems and hypothefes which had fucceffively been urged upon the world were become fo numerous, that, from a view of this inconftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal fcepticifm was the natural confequence of this conclu- fion. In order to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the human faculties, Plato laid hold of the principles of the academical philofophy; and, in his Academics, Phaedo, reafons in the following manner. “ If we are Academy","Plato, Athens, Plato, Plato","CO,US",2,"Colombia,United States","South America,North America"
"A philofopher poffeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrtfs ; but will feldom fall into errors, or have occalion to alter his opinion after it is once formed. Vanity and precipitance are the great fources of fcepticifm: hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plunged themfelves into an abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcepticifm. They pretend to difcredit things that are plain, Ample, and eafily comprehended ; but give peremptory and decilive judgments upon fubjedts that evidently exceed the limits of our capacity. Of thefe, Berkley and Hume are the moft confiderable. Berkley . denied the exiftence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a ftep further, and queftioned even the exiftence of ideas; but at the fame time has not hefitated to .give determined opinions with regard to eternity, providence, and a future ftate, miraculous interpofitions of the Deity, &c. fubjedts far above the reach of our faculties. In his effay on the academical or fceptical philofophy, he has confounded two very oppofite fpecies of philofophy. After the days of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firft academy were grofsly corrupted by Arcefilas, Carneades, &c. This might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the academical and fceptical philofophy were fynonimous terms. But no principles can be of a more oppofite nature than thofe which were inculcated by the old academy of-Socrates and Plato, and the fceptical notions which were propa¬ gated by Arcefilas, Carneades, and the other difciples of the fucceeding academics","Of, Plato, Plato","CO,TR",2,"Colombia,Turkey","South America,Asia"

Towards winter they collect in great docks, but in all feafonslive and feed in the fens. The grey lag is the origin of the domedic goofe; it is the only fpe¬ cies that the Britons could take young, and familiarize: the other two never breed here, and migrate during fummer.

To perpetuate the memory of this daughter, he intitled his commentary upon the Decretals of Grego¬ ry IX. the Novella. He married her to John Calde- rinus, a learned canonift. The firft work of Andreas was his Glofs upon the fixth Book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote alfo Gloffes upon the Clementines; and a Commentary in regulas Sexti, which he intitled Mercuriales, becaufc he either engaged in it on Wednefdays (diebus Mercit- rii,) or becaufe he inferted his Wednefdays difputes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durant, in the year 1347. This is all which Mr Bayle mentions of his writings, tho’ he wrote many more.

He was enlight¬ ened with the knowledge of the Chriftian religion by being prefent at a fermon in the great church of Va¬ lencia on the day of Aiiumption of the bleffed Virgin, in the year 1487. Upon this he defired to be bapti¬ zed; and, in memory of the calling of St John and St Andrew, he received the name John Andreas. “ Ha¬ ving received holy orders (fayshe), and, from an alfaqui and a flave of Lucifer, become a prieft and minifter of Chrift; I began, like St Paul, to preach and publifh the contrary of what I had erroneoufly believed and afferted ; and, with the affiftance of Almighty God, AND Andreas J converted at firll a great many fouls of the Moors, (J'’bn) who were in danger of hell, and under the dominion Andrelinas Lucifer, and conduced them into the way of falva-    tion. After this, I was fent for by the moll catholic prince, king Ferdinand, and queen Ifabella, in order to preach in Granada to the Moors of that kingdom, which their majefties had conquered: by God’s blef- fing on my preaching, an infinite number of Moors were brought to abjure Mahomet, and to turn to Chrift. A little after this, I was made a canon by their grace; and fent for again by the moll Chriftian queen Ifabella to Arragon, that I might be employed in the converfion of the Moors of thofe kingdoms, who ftill perfifted in their errors, to the great contempt and dilhonour of our crucified Saviour, and the prodigious lofs and danger of all Chriftian princes. But this ex¬ cellent and pious defign of her majefty was rendered in- effe£lual by her death.” At the defire of Martin Gar¬ cia, bilhop of Barcelona, he undertook to tranllate from the Arabic, into the language of Arragon, the whole law of the Moors ; and after having finilhed this undertaking, he compofed his famous work of Ths Confufton of the Sett of Mahumed; it contains twelve chapters, wherein he has collefted the fabulous ftories, impoftures, forgeries, brutalities, follies, obfcenities, absurdities, impoflibilities, lies, and contradi&ions, which Mahomet, in order to deceive the fimple peo¬ ple, has difperfed in the writings of that feft, and e- fpecially in the alcoran, which, as he fays, was revealed to him in one night by an angel, in the city of Meke; though in another place he contradicts himfelf, and af¬ firms that he was 20 years in compofing it. Andreas tells us, he wrote this work, that not only the learned amongft Chriftians, but even the common people might know the different belief and doCtrine of the Moors ; and on the one hand might laugh and ridicule fuch in- folent and brutal notions, and on the other might la¬ ment their blindnefs and dangerous condition.

"ARISTOPHANES, a celebrated comic poet of Athens. He was cotemporary with Plato, Socrates, and Euripides ; and moil of his plays were written during the Peloponnefian war. His imagination,was warm and lively, and his genius particularly turned to raillery: he had alfo great- fpirit and refolution ; and was a declared enemy to flavery, and to all thofe who wanted to opprefs their country. The Athenians fuf- fered themfelves in his time to be governed by men who had no other views than to make themfelves ma¬ tters of the commonwealth. Ariftophanes expcfed the defigns of thefe men, with great wit and feverity, upon the ftage. Cleo was the firft whom he attacked, in his- comedy of the Equites ; and as there was not one of the comedians who would venture to perfonate a man of his great authority, Ariftophanes played the character himfelf, and with fo much fuccefs, that the Athenians obliged Cleo to pay a fine of five talents, which were given to the poet. He defcribed the af¬ fairs of the Athenians in fo exa<tt a manner, that his comedies are a faithful hiftory of that people. For this reafon, when Dionyfius king of Syracufe deisred to learn the ftate and language of Athens, Plato fent him the comedies of Ariftophanes, telling him, thefe were the bett reprefentation thereof. He wrote above 50 comedies; but there are only 11 extant which are perfedt: thefe are, Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, E- quites, the Acharnenfes, the Wafps, Peace, the Birds, the Ecclefiazufae or Female Orators, the Thefmopho- fiazufe or Prieftefles of Ceres, and Lyfiftrata. The ' Clouds, which he wrote in ridicule of Socrates *, is the moft celebrated of all his comedies : Madam Dacier tells us, (he was fo much charmed with this perform¬ ance, that after (lie had tranflated it, and read it over 200 times, it did not become the lead tedious to her, which (he could not fay of any other piece; and that the pleafure which (he received from it was fo exqui- fite, that (he forgot all the contempt and indignation which Ariftophanes deferved for employing his wit to ruin a man, who was wifdom itfelf, and the greateft ornament of the city of Athens.
