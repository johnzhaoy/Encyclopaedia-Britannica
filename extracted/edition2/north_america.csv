"ABARIS, the Hyperborean; a celebrated fage of antiquity, whdfehiftory and travels have been the fubject of much learned difeufiion. Such a number of fabulous * Jamblicb. ftorjeS* were told of him, that Herodotus himfelf feems ^f Lab if t0 fcruple to relate them. Fie tells us only -j-, that this cap. 36. Barbarian was faid to have travelled with an arrow, and took no fuftenance : but this does not acquaint us with the marvellous properties which were attributed to that arrow; nor that it had been given him by the Hyperborean Apollo. With regard to the occafion of } Under the his leaving his native country, Harpocration J tells us, word ’Afa- that the whole earth being infefted with a deadly f” plague, Apollo, upon being confulted, gave no other ] ABA anfwer, than that the Athenians ftiould offer up prayers in behalf oi all other nations: upon which, feveral countries deputed ambaffadors to Athens, among whom was Abaris the Hyperborean. In this journey, he renewed the alliance between his country¬ men and the inhabitants of the ifland of Delos. It appears that he alfo went to Lacedaemon; fince, ac¬ cording to fome writers ||, he there built a temple con- fecrated to Proferpine the Salutary. It is aflerted, that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes, • driving away plagues, laying ftorms J, &c. He wrote feveral books, as Suidasf informs us, viz. Apollo’s arrival into the country of the Hyperboreans ; The nuptials of the river Hebrus; ©ioyov.a, or the Generation of the Gods; A colleftion of oracles; &c. Himerius * the fophift applauds him for'fpeaking pure Greek; which at¬ tainment will be no matter of wonder to fuch as con- fider the ancient intercourfe there was between the Greeks and Hyperboreans.—If the Hebrides, or Weftern Iflands of Scotland, (fays Mr Tolandf), were the Hyperboreans of Diodorus J, then the celebrated Abaris was of that country; and Ukewife a druid, having been the prieft of Apollo. Suidas, who knew not the diftin&ion of the infular Hyperboreans, makes him a Scythian; as do fome others, mifled by the fame vulgar error; though Diodorus has truly fixed his country in an ifland, and not on the continent. And indeed the fi&ions and miftakes concerning our Abaris are infinite: however, it is by all agreed that he travelled quite over Greece, and from thence into Italy, where he convetfed familiarly with Pythagoras, who favour¬ ed him beyond all his -difciples, by inftrufting him in his dodtrines (efpecially his thoughts of nature) in a plainer and more compendious method than he did any other. This diftindtion could not but be very advan¬ tageous to Abaris. The Hyperborean, in return, prefented the Samian, as though he equalled Apollo himfelf in wifdom, with the facred arrow, on which the Greeks have fabuloufly related * that he fat aftride, and flew upon it, through the air, over rivers and lakes, forefts and mountains; in like manner as our vulgar ftill believe, particularly thofe of the Hebrides, that wizards and witches fly whitherfoe ver they pleafe on their broom- fticks. The orator Himerius above mentioned, tho’ one of thofe who, from the equivocal fenfe of the word Hyperborean, feem tohave miftaken Abaris for a Scy¬ thian, yet deferibes his perfon accurately, and gives him a very noble charadter. “ They relate (fays he) “ that Abaris the fage was by nation an Hyperbo- “ rean, appeared a Grecian in fpeech, and refembled “ a Scythian in his habit and appearance. He came “ to Athens, holding a bow in his hand, having a “ quiver hanging on his ftioulders, his body wrapt up “ in a plad, girt about the loins with a gilded belt, “ and wearing trowzers reaching from his wafte down- “ ward.” By this it is evident (continues Mr To- land) that he was not habited like a Scythian, who were always covered with Ikins; but appeared in the native garb of an Aboriginal Scot. As to what re¬ lates to his abilities, Himerius informs us, that “he was affable and pleafant in converfation, in difpatch- 1 lnS great affairs fecret and induftrious, quick-fighted 1 in prefent exigencies, in preventing future dangers cir- ! cumfpedt, a fearcher after wifdom, defirous of friend- ‘ fhip, trufting indeed little to fortune, andhaving every “ thing Abaris the Hyper¬ borean","Athens, Athens","GR,US,IT",2,"Greece,United States,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe"

"ABBOT (George), archbifhop of Canterbury, was born October 29.-1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He went through his ftudies at Oxford, and in 1597 was chpfen principal of Univerfity College. In'!599, he was inftalled dean of Winchefter : the year following, he was chofen vice-chancellor of the univerfity of Ox¬ ford, and a fecond time in 1603'. In 1604, that tranf- lation of the bible now in ufe was begun by the direc¬ tion of king James; and Dr Abbot was the fecond of eight divines of Oxford, to whom the care of tranfla- ting the whole New Teftament (excepting the epiftles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In 1608., he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar, to affift in efta- blifiiing ap union betwixt the kirk of Scotland and the * Beylin’s church of England; and in this affair he behaved* with hift. of Pref- j-jych addrefs and moderation, that it laid the founda- p^:anS' tion of all his future preferment. For king James ever after paid great deference to his advice and counfel; and upon the death of Dr Overton bifliop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his fucceffor, who was accordingly confecrated bilhop of thofe two united fees in December 1609. About a month afterwards he was tranflated to the fee of London, and on the fe¬ cond of November thereafter was raifed to the archie- pifcopal fee. His great zeal for the Proteftant religion made him a ftrenuous promoter of the match between the Eledtor Palatine and the princefs Elizabeth; which was accordingly concluded and folemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbifhop performing the cere¬ mony on a ftage erected in the royal chapel. In the following year happened the famous cafe of divorce be¬ twixt the iadyFrancis Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Effex : an affair which has been by many confidered as one of the greateft blemifhes of king James’s reign; but the part atted therein by the archbifhop added much to the reputation he had al¬ ready acquired for incorruptible integrity. The matter was by the king referred to a court of delegates. The archbifhop fawplainly, that his Majefly was very defirous tjie lady flioqld be divorced^ but. he -was, in his own judgment, dire£tly againfl the divorce. He labour¬ ed all he could to extricate himfelf from this difficulty, by having an end put to the caufe by fome other way than by fentence : but it was to no purpofe; for thofe who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be reftrained from bringing it to the conclufion the king defired. The archbifhop prepared a fpeech, which he intended to have fpoken againft the nullity of the mar¬ riage, in the court at Lambeth ; but he did not make ufe of it, becaufe the king ordered the opinions to be given in few words. He continued, however, in¬ flexible in his opinion againfl: the divorce ; and drew up his reafons, which the king thought fit to anfwer himfelf. It need fcarce be added, that fentence was gi¬ ven in the lady’s favour.—In 1618, the king publifh- ed a declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting fports and paftimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneafmefs to the archbifhop; Archbifhop who, happening to be at Croydon when it came thither,  had the courage to forbid its being read.—Being now in a declining flate of health, the archbifhop ufed in the fummer to go to Hampfhire for the fake of re¬ creation ; and being invited by lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greateft misfortune that ever befell him; for he accidentally kill¬ ed the game-keeper, by an arrow from a crofs-bow which he fhot at one of the deer. This accident threw him into a deep melancholy; and he ever afterwards kept a monthly fall on Tuefday, the day on which this fatal mifchance happened, and he fettled an an¬ nuity of 20/. on the widow*.

"Now, his argument (for there happen; to be but one) is, “ That experience, which in fome things is variable, in others uniform, is our only guide in reafoning “ concerning matters of faft. A variable experience “ gives rife to probability only; an uniform expe- “ rience amounts to a proof. Our belief of any fa ft “ from the teftimony of eye-witneffes, is derived from “ no other principle than our experience in the veraci- “ ty of human teftimouy. If the faft attefted be mi- “ raculous, here arifes a conteft of two oppofite expe- “ riences, or proof againft proof. Now, a miracle is “ a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and “ unalterable experience has eftabliftied thefe laws, the “ proof againft a miracle, from the very nature of the “ faft, is as complete as any argument from expe- “ rience can poffibly be imagined ; and if fo, it is an “ undeniable confequence, that it cannot be furmount- “ ed by any proof whatever derived from human tefti- “ mony.” In Dr Campbell’s Differtation on Miracles, the au¬ thor’s principal aim is to ftiew the fallacy of Mr Hume’s argument; which lie has done moft fuccefsfully by an¬ other Angle argument, as follows : “ The evidence arifing from human teftimony is not “ folely derived from experience : on the contrary, te- “ ftimony hath a natural influence on belief antecedent “ to experience. The early and unlimited affent given “ to teftimony by children gradually contrafts as they “ advance in life : it is, therefore, more confonant to “ truth, to fay, that our diffidence in teftimony is the “ refult of experience, than that our faith in it has this “ foundation. Befides, the uniformity of experience, “ in favour of any faft, is not a proof againft its being “ reverfed in a particular inftance. The evidence ari- “ fing from the Angle teftimony of a man of known “ veracity will go rarther to eftablifti a belief in its be- “ ing aftually reverfed: If his teftimony be confirmed “ by a few others of the fame charafter, we cannot “ with-hold our affent to the truth of it. Now, tho’ “ the operations of nature are governed by uniform “ laws, and though we have not the teftimony of our “ fenfes in favour of any violation of them ; fiill, if in “ particular inftances we have the teftimony of thou- “ funds of our fellow-creatures, and thofe too men of “ ftrift integrity, fwayed by no motives of ambition “ or intereft, and governed by the principles of com- “ mon fenfe, That they were aftually eye-witnefles “ of thefe violations, the conftitution of our nature “ obliges us to believe them.” Thefe two examples contain the fubftance of about 400 pages.

The flowers of this kind come out in larger clufters than the other, and furround the fmall branches, fo that the tree appears entirely covered with them, and makes a much more beautiful appearance than the for¬ mer, Acer, the Maple-tree ACE [ 47 ] ACE Acer, mer, which now is not fo much efteemed. 6. The fac- - lhe charinum, or American fugar-maple, fo called from a M-ipie-tree. coarfe 0f fUgar being obtained from its juice by * See Sugar. the inhabitants of North America *, grows to a large fize. When young, it very much refembles the Nor¬ way maple: but as it grows up, the leaves become more deeply divided, and their furfaces lefs fmooth ; they are, befides, preyed upon by infers, like the fyca- . more ; by which circumftances the two fpecies are eafi- ly diftin'guifhed. 7. The Penfylvanicum, or Ameri¬ can mountain-maple, very much refembles the fugar- maple, only its leaves are more pointed. 8. The opa- lus, or Italian maple, is very common in moft parts of Italy, particularly about Rome; but in Britain is very rarely to be met with, though hardy enough to bear the open air. It is one of the larged fpecies of trees in Italy, and affords a great fhade by its nume¬ rous and large leaves. On this account it is planted on the road-fides, and near habitations. 9. The monfpe- fulanum, or Montpelier maple, is common in the fouth of France, and in Italy ; but is hardly met with in Britain. The leaves refemble thofe of the common maple ; but are of a much thicker fubftance, a fhining green colour, and not fo large. They continue in ver¬ dure very late in the autumn, which renders the trees more valuable. 10. The creticum, or Cretan maple, grows naturally in the Levant; it fomewhat refembles the laft fpecies; but its leaves are of a much thinner texture, and their footftalks covered with a foft hairy down ; whereas thofe of the other are fmooth and foft",Rome,"IT,US,FR",2,"Italy,United States,France","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Culture. All thefe fpecies are propagated either by feeds or cuttings. If the firfl method is chofen, the feeds fhould be fown in autumn, foon after they are ripe, in a bed of common earth, covering them about half an inch thick with light mould. If they cannot be fown in autumn, they muff be put into fand to preferve their growing quality ; for if kept dry till the fpring, the feeds often fail, or at lead lie a whole year in the ground before they vegetate. The feeds ought alfo to be fown in a fheltered fituation ; becaufe moft forts of maple, efpecially thofe which come from America, are very im¬ patient of heat while ypung ; and if the young plants are expofed to the fun but one day, few of them will furvive ; being inftantly attacked by infedts, which in that fhort time devour their feed-leaves, after which the plants drop to the ground. This is moft efpecially remarkable in the American fugar-maple. When the plants come up, they muft be kept free from weeds, and in the following autumn tranfplanted into the nurfery, where they may grow two or three years, and then be planted where they are to remain. If maple-trees are to be propagated by cuttings, they Ihould be planted in au¬ tumn, if the ground is dry ; but where the foil is cold and moift, the fpring feafon is preferable. If cut from the trees before the buds begin to fwell, and the ground is not then fit to receive them, they may be wrapped in mofs, and put in a cool place, where they will keep a month or five weeks without injury ; but the trees pro¬ pagated from cuttings are not fo valuable as thofe from feeds, becaufe they feldom grow fo large or fo upright",,US,2,United States,North America

To be a little more precife, fuppofe ABC, the fig- '• ftring of an harpfichord fcrewed to a proper pitch, and drawn out of the right line by the finger at B. We have * See Eh- elfewhere obferved#, that fuch a ftring would, if let go, ft kity. vibrate to E; and from E to D, and back again. We obferved, that it would continue thus te vibrate like a pendulum for ever, if not externally refifted, and, like a pendulum, all its little vibrations would be performed in equal times, the laft and the firft being equally long in performing. We (hewed alfo, that, like a pendulum, its greateft fwiftnefs would always be when it arrived at E, the middle part of its motion. Now then, if this ftring be fuppofed to fly from the finger at B, it is ob¬ vious, that whatever be its own motion, fuch alfo will be the motion of the parts of air that fly before it. Its motion, as is obvious, is firft uniformly accelerated for¬ ward from B to E, then retarded as it goes from E to D, accelerated back again as it returns from D to E, and retarded from E to B. This motion being there¬ fore fent in fucceffion through a range of elaftic air, it muft happen, that the parts of one range of air muft be fent forward with accelerated motion, and then with a retarded motion.

In the mean time, while the parts of the firft range are thus falling back, the parts of the fecond range are going forward with an accelerated motion.

The kifs thus given was called ofculum labraturn ; for ordinarily they were afraid to touch the images of their gods themfelves with their profane lips.

No fooner had he arrrived at the im¬ perial dignity, than he made peace with the Perfians, to whom he yielded up great part of the conquefts of his predecelfors ; and from generofity, or policy, he remitted the debts of the Roman people, which, ac¬ cording to the calculation of thofe who have reduced them to modern money, amounted to 22,500,000 gol¬ den crowns ; and he burnt all the bonds and obliga¬ tions relating to thofe debts, that the people might be under no apprehenfion of being called to an account for them afterwards.

Having thus fettled matters in Britain, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Reftorer of Britain, as appears by fome medals. He foon after went into Spain, to Mauritania, and at length into the Fall, where he quieted the commotions raifed by the Parthians. After having vifited all the provinces of Afia, he returned to Athens in 125, where he palled the winter, and was initiated in the mylleries of Eleu- finian Ceres. He went from thence to Sicily, chiefly to view mount Aitna, contemplate its phenomena, and en¬ joy the beautiful and extenfive profpeft afforded from its top.

"Concerning the products and general appearance of General ap-this vulcano, authors are much better agreed.—The pearance, journey from Catania to its fummit has been lately c‘ deferibed by three travellers, M. D’Orville, Mr Bry- done, and Sir William Hamilton. All thefe agree, that this Angle mountain affords an epitome of the dif¬ ferent climates throughout the whole world : towards the foot, it is very hot; farther up^. more temperate; and grows gradually more and more cold the higher we afeend.

"ed of ftones and afties; and, as Mr Hamilton was in¬ formed by feveral people of Catania, had been thrown up about 25 or 30 years before the time (1769) he vifited mount vEtna. Before this mountain was thrown up, there was only a prodigious large chafm, orgulph, in the middle of the above-mentioned plain ; and it has been remarked, that about once in 100 years the top of vEtna falls in; which undoubtedly muft be the cafe at certain periods, or the mountain behoved conti- nually to increafe in height. As this little mountain, though emitting finoke from every pore, appeared fo¬ lk! and firm, Mr Hamilton and his companions went up to the very top. In the middle is a hollow, about two miles and a half in circumference, according to Mr Hamilton ; three miles and a half, according to Mr Brydone ; and three or four, according to Mr D’Or¬ ville. The infide is crufted over with falts and fulphur of different colours. It goes {helving down, from the top, like an inverted cone ; the depth, in Mr Hamil¬ ton’s opinion, nearly correfponding to the height of the little mountain. From many places of this fpace iffue volumes of fulphureous fmoke, which being much heavier than the circumambient air, inftead of amend¬ ing in it, roll down the fide of the mountain, till, co¬ ming to a more denfe atmofphere, it {hoots off horizon¬ tally, and forms a large traft in the air, according to the direction of the wind; which, happily for our tra¬ vellers, carried it exaftly to the fide oppofite to which they were placed. In the middle of this funnel is the tremenduous and unfathomable gulph, fo much cele¬ brated in all ^ges, both as the terror of this life, and the place of puniftiment in the next. From this gulph continually iffue terrible and confufed noifes, which in eruptions are increafed to fuch a degree as to be heard at a prodigious diftance. Its diameter is probably very different at different times : for Mr Hamilton obfer- ved, by the wind clearing away the fmoke from time to time, that the inverted hollow cone was contracted almoft to a point; while Mr D’Orville and Mr Bry¬ done found the opening very large. Both Mr Bry¬ done and Mr Hamilton found the crater too hot to defeend into it; but Mr D’Orville was bolder : and accordingly he and his fellow-traveller, faftened to ropes which two or three men held at a diftance for fear of accidents, defeended as near as poffible to the brink of the gulph ; but the fmall flames and fmoke which iffued from it on every fide, and a greenifh ful¬ phur and pumice-ftones, quite black, which covered the margin, would not permit them to come fo near as to have a full view. They only faw diftindtly in the middle, a mafs of matter which rofe, in the ihape of a cone, to the height of above 60 feet, and which towards the bafe, as far as their fight could reach, might be 600 or 800.

Immediately a ftiower of ftones fell; upon which he thought proper to retire. Pheno¬ mena of this kind, in all probability, precede the e- ruptions of ./Etna, in a much greater degree.—-The fmoke at length appears wholly black in the day-time, and in the night has the appearance of flame; fhowers of allies are fent forth, earthquakes are produced, the mountain difcharges volleys of red-hot ftones to a great height in the air. The force by which thefe ftones are projefted, as well as their magnitude, feems to be in proportion to the bulk of the mountain. Signior Recupero affured Mr Brydone, that he had feen im- menfely large ones thrown perpendicularly upwards to the height of 7000 feet, as he calculated from the time they took to arrive at the earth after begin¬ ning to defcend from their greateft elevation. The largeft ftone, or rather rock, that was ever known to be emitted by Vefuvius, was 12 feet long, and 45 in cir¬ cumference.

"“ After having taken breath, as the earth flill trem- “ bled greatly, I thought it moft prudent to leave the “ mountain and return to my villa; where I found my “ family in a great alarm at the continual and violent “ explofions of the vulcano, which fhook our houfe to “ its very foundation, the doors and windows fwing- “ ing upon their hinges..—The noife and fmell of ful- “■ phur increafing, we removed from our villa to Naples: “ and I thought proper, as I puffed by Portici, to “ inform the court of what I had feen ; and humbly “ offered it as my opinion, that his Sicilian Majefly <£ fhould leave the neighbourhood of the threatening “ mountain. 1 obferved, in my way to Naples, “ which was in lefs than two hours after I had left the “ mountain, that the lava had actually covered three “ miles of the very road through which we had re- “ treated. It is aflonifhing that it fhould have run fo “ fall; as I have fince feen, that the river of lava in “ the Atrio di Cavallo was 60 and 70 feet deep, and in “ fogae places near two miles broad. When his Sici- <£ Man Majefly quitted Portici, the noife was greatly “ increafed; and the concuffion of the air from the ex- “ plofions was fo violent, that, in the king’s palace, doors and windows were forced open, and even one “ door there, which was locked, was neverthelefs burfl ££ open. At Naples, the fame night, many windows “ and doors flew open: (the windows at Naples open 1“ like-folding doors.) In my houfe, which is not on <£ the fide of the town next Vefuvius, I tried the ex- “ periment of unbolting my windows, when they flew <£ wide open upon every explofion of the mountain","Naples, Portici, Naples, Portici, Naples","US,IT",2,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"*£ Befides thefe explofions, which were very frequent, *e there was a continued fubterraneous and violent “ rumbling noife, which lafted this night about five <£ hours.” No doubt the fame terrible appearances are put on by iEtna at the time its lavas break forth; but in a much greater degree, in proportion to the fuperior fize of the mountain.—The appearance, and indeed the ef- fe£ls, of the lava itfelf, are very dreadful. When it firft iffues, the lava appears very fluid, and runs with the ra¬ pidity of a fwiftriver: but even then it furprifingly re¬ fills the impreflion of folid bodies; for Sir Wm Hamil¬ ton could not pierce that of Vefuvius with a flick dri¬ ven againft it with all his force; nor did the' largefl Hone he was able to throw upon it fink, but made a flight impreffion, and then floated along. This hap¬ pened almofl at the very mouth, when the lava appear¬ ed liquid as water, and when he faw it running with a rapidity equal to the river Severn at the paffage near Briftol.—A defcription of the lava iffuing from mount iEtna in 1669 was fent to the court of England by Lord Winchelfea, who at that time happened to be at Catania in his way home from an embaffy at Conflanti- nople. His account is not now to be procured; but Mr Hamilton found a copy in Sicily, and hath given an extradl, part of which follows. ££ When it was ££ night, I went upon two towers in divers places ; “ and I could plainly fee, at ten miles diftance, as we “ judged, the lire begin to run from the mountain in ££ a direct line, the flame to afcend-as high and as big ££ as one of the greatefl fteeples in your Majefty’s “ kingdoms, and to throw up great Hones into the air; “ I could difcern the river of fire to defcend the mouh- “ tain of a terrible fiery or red colour, and ftones of a “ paler red to fwim thereon, and to be fome as big as “ an ordinary table. We could fee this fire to move “ in feveral other places, and all the country covered “ with fire, afcending with great flames in many pla- “ ces, fmoking like to a violent furnace of iron melted, “ making a noife with the great pieces that fell, efpe- “ dally thofe that fell into the fea. A cavalier of <£ Malta, who lives there, and attended me, told me, that the river was as liquid, where it iffues out of the “ mountain, as water, and came out like -a torrent “ with great violence, and is five or fix fathom deep, “ and as broad, and that no ftones fink therein.” The account given in the Philofophical Tranfadlions is to the fame purpefe. We are there told, that the la¬ va is “ nothing elfe than diverfe kinds of metals and “ minerals, rendered liquid by the fiercenefs of the fire “ in the bowels of the earth, boiling up find gulhing “ forth as the water doth at the head of fome great ri- “ ver; and having run in a full body for a ftone’s-caft “ or more, began to cruft or curdle, becoming, when “ cold, thofe hard porous ftones which the people call “ Sciarri.” Thofe, though cold in comparifon of what firft iffues from the mountain, yet retained fo much heat as to referable huge cakes of fea-coal ftrongly ig¬ nited, and came tumbling over one another, bearing down or burning whatever was^ in their way.—In this manner the lava proceeded flowly on till it came to the fea, when a moft extraordinary conflift enfued betwixt the two adverfe elements. The noife was vaftly more dreadful than the loudeft thunder, being heard thro* the whole country to an immenfe diftance ; the water feemed to retire and diminifh before the lava, while clouds of vapour darkened the fun.

This gives room to judge, that thofe ftones have been produced by a fat and vifeid juice, which has the property of indurating whatever matter it filtrates into.

The prin¬ cipal colour of thefe muftirooms is fometimes yellowilh, and fometimes of a bright purple; but they are always diffeminated with different fpots, of a deep orange co¬ lour, or red brown ; and when thefe fpots are recent, and ftill in full bloom, they produce a very agreeable effeft to the fight.

"The invalion of the Normans, in 1066, contributed very much to the improvement of agriculture ; for, by that event, many thoufands of hulbandmen from Flan¬ ders, France, and Normandy, fettled in Britain, ob¬ tained eftates or farms, and cultivated them after the manner of their country. The implements of hulban- dry, ufed at this time, were of the fame kind with thofe employed at prefent; but fome of them were lefs per- feCl in their conftruftion. The plough, for example, had but one ftilt, or handle, which the ploughman uided with one hand, having in his other hand an in- rument which ferved both for cleaning and mending the plough, as well as for breaking the clods. The Norman plough had two wheels ; and in the light foil of Normandy was commonly drawn by one or two oxen; but, in England, a greater number was often neceflary. In Wales, the perfon who conduCled the oxen in the plough walked backwards.

Providence has negledted no region in¬ tended for the habitation of man. If in warm cli¬ mates the foil be meliorated by the fun, it is no lefs meliorated by froft in cold climates. Froft a6ts upon water, by expanding it into a larger fpace. Froft has no effeft upon dry earth; witnefs fand, upon which it it makes no impreffion. But upon wet earth it a£ts moft vigoroufly: it-expands the moifture, which re¬ quiring more fpace puts every particle of the earth out of its place, and feparates them from each other. In that view, froft may be confidered as a plough fuperior to any that is made, or can be made, by the hand of man : its a&ion reaches the minuteft particles; and, by dividing and feparating them, it renders the foil loofe and friable. This operation is the moft remarkable in tilled land, which gives free accefs to froft. With re- fpetl to clay-foil in particular, there is no rule in huf- bandry more elfential than to open it before winter in hopes of froft.

The yellowilh alabafter, or phengites of Pliny, is found in Greece; and is of a foft loofe open texture, pretty heavy, and nearly of the colour of honey. This fpe¬ cies has likewife been found in Germany, France, and in Derbyfhire in England. 3. Variegated, yellow, and reddifli alabafter. This fpecies is the common ala¬ bafter of the ancients, and is fo foft that it may be cut with a knife ; It is remarkably bright, and almoft tranfparent ; admits of a fine polilh and confifts of large angular fparry concretions. It is not proof a- gainft water ; it ferments violently with aqua-fortis, and burns to a pale yellow. The colour of this fpecies is a clear pale yellow refembling amber, and variegated with undulated veins; fotne of which are pale red, others whitilh, and others of a pale brown. It was formerly brought from Egypt, Jbut is now to be met with in feveral parts of England. The alabafters are frequently ufed by ftatuaries for fmall ftatues, vafes, and columns.

The Greeks, who had before fled on board their fhips, being apprifed of this, returned on a fudden, furprifed the town, and put all the Arabs they found therein to the fword: but Amri, receiving advice of what had happened, fuddenly returned, and drove them out of it with great flaughter ; after which the Greeks were fo intimidated, that he had nothing far¬ ther to fear from them.—A few years after, however, Amri being deprived of his government by the khalif Othman, the Egyptians were fo much difpleafed with his difmiffion, that they inclined to a revolt; andCon- ftantine, the Greek emperor, having received intelli- ence of their difaffeftion, began to meditate the re¬ union of Alexandria. For this purpofe, he fent one Manuel, an eunuch, and his general, with a powerful army, to retake that place ; which, by the affiftance of the Greeks in the city, who kept a fecret correfpon- E e 2 dence [ 219 ] ALE [ 220 ] ALE Alexandria, dence with the imperial forces while at fea, and joined them as foon as they had made a defcent, he effefted, without any confiderable effufion of Chriftian blood","Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria","US,GR",2,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"The khalif, now perceiving his miftake, immediately reftored Amri to his former dignity. This ftep was very agreeable to the natives; who having had expe¬ rience of the military fldll and bravery of this renown- ed general, and apprehending that they fhould be call¬ ed to an account by the Greeks for their former perfi¬ dious conduct, had petitioned Othman to fend him a- gain into Egypt.—Upon Amri’s arrival, therefore, at Alexandria, the Copts, or natives, with the traitor Al- Mokawkas (who had formerly betrayed to Amri the fortrefs of Mefr) at their head, not only joined him, but fupplied him with all kinds of provifions, exciting him to attack the Greeks without delay. This he did; and, after a moft obftinate difpute which lafted feveral days, drove them into th? town, where, for fome time, they defended themfelves with great bravery, and re¬ pelled the utmoft efforts of the befiegers. This fo ex- afperated Amri, that he fwore, “ If God enabled him to conquer the Greeks, he would throw down the walls of the city, and make it as eafy of accefs as a banvdy- boufe, which lies open to every body.” Nor did he fail to execute this menace ; for having taken the town by ftorm, he quite difmantled it, entirely demolifhing the walls and fortifications. The lives of the citizens, however, were Ipa^ed, at leaft as far as lay in the ge¬ neral’s power; but many of them were put to the fword by the foldiers on their firft entrance. In one quarter, particularly, Amri found them butchering the Alex¬ andrians with unrelenting barbarity; to which, how¬ ever, by his feafonable interpofition, he put a flop, and on that fpot erefted a mofque, which he called the mofque of mercy",Alexandria,"EG,US",2,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

It continued under the dominion of the khalifs till the year 924, when it was taken by the Ma- grebians, two years after its great church had been de- Atroyed by fire.

"What contributed to raife Alexandria to fuch a pro¬ digious height of fplendor as it enjoyed for a long time; was, its being the centre of commerce between the Eail- ern and Weliern parts of the world.. It was with the view of becoming mailer of this lucrative trade, that Alexander built this’ city, after having extirpated the Tyrians, who formerly engrofled all the Eall-India traffic.

Thus, in the 13th century, when the barbarifm introduced by the Goths, &c. began to wear off from the European nations, and they acquired a tafle for the elegan¬ cies of life, the old mart of Alexandria began to re¬ vive ; and the port, though far from recovering its former magnificence, grew once more famous by be¬ coming the centre of commerce : but having fallen un¬ der the dominion of the Turks, and the paffage round the Cape of Good Hope being difcovered by the Por- tuguefe in 1499, a fatal blow was given to the Alex¬ andrian commerce, and the city has fince fallen into decay","Alexandria, Alexandria","EG,US",2,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

In 884, a frefli number of Danes landed in Kent, and laid fiege to Rochefter; but the king coming to the relief of that city, they were obli¬ ged to abandon their defign.

Before Alfred marched againft the enemy, he obliged the Danes, fettled in Northumber¬ land and Elfex, to give him hoftages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and pitched his camp between their armies, to prevent their junction. A great body, however, moved off to Ef- fex ; and croffing the river, came to Farnham in Surry, where they were defeated by the king’s forces. Mean while the Danes fettled in Northumberland, in breach of treaty, and notwithftanding the hoftages given, e- quipped two fleets; and, after plundering the northern and fouthern coafts, failed to Exeter, and befieged it","Kent, Middleton, Farnham, Exeter","US,GB,FR",2,"United States,United Kingdom,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The king, as foon as he received intelligence, marched againft them ; but before he reached Exeter, they had got poffeflion of it. Fie kept them, however, blocked up on all fides; and reduced them at laft to fuch extremi¬ ties, that they were obliged to eat their horfes, and were even ready to devour each other. Being at length ren¬ dered defperate, they made a general fally on the be- fiegers; but were defeated, though with great lofs on the king’s fide. The remainder of this body of Danes fled into Effex, to the fort they had built there, and to their (hips. Before Alfred had time to recruit him- felf, another Danilli leader, whofe name was Laf, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and de- ftroyed all before him, marching on to the city of Werheal in the weft, which is fuppofed to be Chefter, where they remained the reft of that year. The year following they invaded North-Wales; and after having plundered and deftroyed every thing, they divided, one body returning to Northumberland, another into the territories of the Eaft-Angles ; from whence they pro¬ ceeded to Effex, and took pofleffion of a fmall ifland called Mereftg. Here they did not long remain: for having parted, fome failed up the river Thames, and others up the Lea-road; where drawing up their ftiips, they built a fort not far from London, which proved a great check upon the citizens, who went in a body and attacked it, but were repulfed with great lofs : at har- veft-time the king himfelf was obliged to encamp with a body of troops in the neighbourhood of the city, in order to cover the reapers from the excurfions of the Danes.

"All our hiftorians agree in diftinguifhing him as one of the moft valiant, wifeft, and belt of kings that ever reigned in England; and it is alfo generally allowed, that he not only digefted feveral particular laws ftill in being, but that he laid the firft foundation of-our pre- fent happy conftitution. There is great reafon to be¬ lieve that we are indebted to this prince for trials by juries; and the doomfday-book, which is preferved in the exchequer, is thought to be no more than ano¬ ther edition of Alfred’s book of Winchefter, which contained a furvey of the kingdom. It is faid alfo, that he was the fifft who divided the kingdom into fhires: what is afcribed to him is not a bare divifion of the country, but the fettling a new form of judicature; for after having divided his dominions into fliires, he fubdi- vided each (hire into three parts, called trythings. There are fome remains of this ancient divifion in the ridings of Yorkfture, the laths of Kent, and the three parts of Lin- colnftiire. Each trything was divided into hundreds or wapentakes ; and thefe again into tythings, or dwell¬ ings of ten houfeholders : each of thefe houfeholdera flood engaged to the king, as a_ pledge for the good be¬ haviour of his family, and all the ten were mutually pledges for each other; fo that if any one of the ty- thing was fufpected of an offence, if the head boroughs or chiefs of the tything would not be fecurity for him, he was imprifoned; and if he made his efcape, the ty¬ thing and hundred were fined to the king. Each fhire was under the government of an earl, under whom was the reive, his deputy;, fince, from his office, called Jhire-reive, or Jheriff. And fo effectual were thefe re¬ gulations, that it is faid he caufed bracelets of gold to fie hung up in the highways, as a challenge to rob¬ bers ; and they remained untouched- In private life, Alfred was the moft amiable man in his dominions ; of fo equal a temper, that he never fuffered either fadnefs or unbecoming gaiety to enter his mind ; but appeared always of a calm, yet cheerful difpofition, familiar to his friends, juft even to his ene¬ mies, kind and tender to all.

"ALIEN, in law, implies a perfon born in a ftrange country, not within the king’s allegiance ; in contra- diftinftion to a denizon, or natural fubjedt. The word is formed from the Latin alius, another; q. d. one born in another country. An alien is incapable of in¬ heriting lands in Britain, till naturalized by an aft of parliament. No alien is entitled to vote at the elec¬ tion of members of parliament; nor can he enjoy any office, or be returned on any jury, unlefs where an alien is party in a caufe, when the inqueft is compofed of an equal number of denizens and aliens. The rea- fons for dtabliflung thefe laws were, that every man is prefumed to bear faith and love to that prince and country where he received proteftion during his infan¬ cy ; and that one prince might not fettle fpies in ano¬ ther’s country ; but chiefly, that the rents and revenues of the country might not be drawn to the fubjefts of another. Some have thought that the laws againfl: a- liena ALI [251] A LI Alien, Hens were introduced in the time of Henry II. when Aliment a ^aw was mai^e at t^e parliament of Wallingford, for  the expulsion of ftrangers, in order to drive away the Flemings and Picards introduced into the kingdom by the wars of king Stephen. Others have thought that the origin of this law was more ancient; and that it is an original branch of the feudal law: for by that law no man can purchafe any lands but he muft be obli- ed to do fealty to the lords of whom the lands are olden ; fo that an alien who owed a previous,faith to another prince, could not take an oath of fidelity in another fovereign’s dominions. Among the Romans, only the Gives Romani were efteemed freemen ; but, when their territories increafed, all the Italians were made free, under the name of Latins, tho’ they had not the privilege of wearing gold rings till the time of Jtiftinian.

"jemarkable Between the New Work! and the Old, there are fe- revalence Veral very ftriking differences; but the moft remarkable rn ' is the general predominance of cold throughout the whole extent of America. Though we cannot, in any country, determine theprecife degree of heat, merely by the diftance from the equator; becaufe the elevation a- bove the fea, the nature of the foil, &c. affedt the cli¬ mate ; yet, in the ancient continent, the heat is much more in proportion to the vicinity to the equator, than in any part of America. Here the rigour of the frigid zone extends over half that which Humid be temperate by its pofition. Even in thofe latitudes where the winter is fcarcely felt on the did continent, it reigns with great feverity in America, tbo’ during a ftiort period. Nor does this cold, prevalent in the New world, confine it- felfto the temperate zones; but extends its influence to the torrid zone alfo, confiderably mitigating the excefs of its heat.—Along the eaftern coaft, the climate, tho’ more fimilar to that of the torrid zone in other parts of the earth, is neverthelefs confiderably milder than in thofe countries of Afia and Africa which lie in the fame latitude.

In all that por¬ tion of- the globe, the wind blows in an invariable di- recxion from eaft to weft. As this wind holds its courfe acrofs the ancient continent, it arrives at the countries which ftretch along the weftern fnore of Africa, infla¬ med with all the fiery particles which it hath collected from the fultry plains of Afia, and the burning fands in the .African defarts. The coaft of Africa is, accord¬ ingly, the region of the earth which feels the moft fer¬ vent heat, and is expofed to the unmitigated ardour of the torrid zone. But this fame wind, which brings fuch an acceffion of warmth to the countries lying between the river of Senegal and Cafraria, traverfes the Atlantic ocean before it reaches tl* American (hore. It is cool¬ ed in its paffage over this vaft body of water; and is felt as a refrefhing gale along the coafts of Bralil and Gui¬ ana, rendering thofe countries, tho’ amongft the warm- eft in America, temperate, when compared with thofe which lie oppolite to them in Africa. As this wind ad¬ vances in its courfe acrofs America, it meets with im- menfe plains, covered with impenetrable forefts; or oc¬ cupied by large rivers, marfiies, and ftagnating waters,, where it can recover no confiderable degree of heat.

On the o- ther hand, the appetite of the Spaniards appeared to to them to be infatiably voradous. They affirmed, that one Spaniard devoured more food in a day than was fufficient for ten Americans.

They will not attack enemies who are prepared for them; but watch their opportunity to murder them when afleep or incapable of making any refiftance. If they find it impofiible to revenge themfelves when the injury is com- mitted, they will difiemble their refentment, but no length of time is fufficent to eradicate that pafiion from their breafts; and whenever an opportunity offers, they will revenge themfelves with the fame Ivellifh fury as if the offence was but juft then committed. A fingle war¬ rior has been known to march feveral hundred miles to furprife and cut off a ftraggling enemy. If a quarrel is once begun, thefe wretches are not fatisfied with the deftru&ion of the perfon who gave the offence ; nor will their revenge be fatiated with the death of all his family or relations, nothing lefs is aimed at than the extermination of the whole tribe or nation to which he belongs. — Agreeably to this principle their wars are carried on; and by ailing upon this principle the Iro¬ quois actually exterminated a nation called the Eries, from which one of the lakes of Canada took its name, fo that now there is not the leaft trace of their exiftence- When two nations, at war, make peace with one ano¬ ther, it is not becaufe they are weary of (laughter, or that they think they have had revenge enough; but be¬ caufe they find themfelves unable to carry on the war any longer.

We have already taken women. notice of the uncommon indifference of the men to¬ wards the women. This, of itfelf, caufes them treat their wives with contempt. Among thefe favages, alfo, the man properly buys his wife. In fome places, he devotes his fervice for a certain time to the parents of the maid whom he courts; in others, he hunts for them occafionally, or affifls in cultivating their fields and forming their canoes; in others, he offers fuoh prefents as are deemed moft valuable on account of their ufeful- nefs or rarity. In return for thefe, he receives his wife; and this circumftance, added to the low eftimation of women among favages, leads him to confider her as a female- fervant, whom he has a title to treat as an in¬ terior.

"Talks are impofed upon them without pity, and fervices are received without complacence or gratitude.

There are diftri&s in A- merica where this dominion is fo grievous, and fo fen- fibly felt, that fqme women, in a wild emotion of ma¬ ternal tendernefs, have deftroyed their female children in their infancy, in order to deliver them from that in¬ tolerable bondage to which they knew they were doomed. 38 It is not to be expefted, that fuch hulbands will in- Revenge the culcate upon their children any kind of filial duty to- [in¬ wards their mothers. Indeed, with the American chil- t0 the Ame- dren, neither their fathers nor mothers are objedls of rican chil- greater regard than other perfons. They treat them al- dren- ways with negledt; and often with fuch harfhnefs and infolence, as to fill thofe with horror who have been witneffes of their conduft. The only piece of educa¬ tion which the favages take care to give their children is, to revenge themfelves on their enemies. For this purpofe, they teach them to fuffer pain in the moft ex¬ treme degree without uttering the leaft complaint; that, in cafe they fall into the hands of their enemies, they may die like men, as they term it: and to fuch an ex¬ traordinary length do they go in this refpedl, that an American boy and girl will often, by way of amufe- ment, hold a burning coal between their naked hands or arms, to try who will fooneft fhrink, or utter a com¬ plaint. 39 As this horrid, implacable defire of revenge is the Terrible only mental qualification which the Americans endea- tnals un<ler~ vour to cherifh, the above-mentioned paffive kind of e][icf?, courage becomes the only teft of their capacity for any public office.

Man *. “ The fort de Vercheres in Canada, belong¬ ing to the French, was, in the year 1690, attacked by fome Iroquois: they approached filently, preparing to fcalet he palifade, when fome mufquet-ftiot made them retire. Advancing a fecond time, they were again re- pulfed, wondering that they could difcover none but a woman, who was feen every where. This was Madame de Vercheres, who appeared as refolute as if fupport- ed by a numerous garrifon. The hopes of ftorming a place without men to defend it, occafioned reiterated attacks. After two days fiege, they retired, fearing to be intercepted in their retreat. Two years after, a party of the fame nation appeared before the fort fo unex- peftedly, that a girl of fourteen, daughter of the pro- prietor, had but time to fhut the gate. With the young woman, there was not a foul but one raw foldier. She fliewed herfelf with her afliftant, fometimes in one place, and fometimes in another; changing her drefs frequently, in order to give fome appearance of a gar¬ rifon ; and. always fired opportunely. The faint-heart¬ ed Iroquois decamped without fuccefs.” We are fenfible, that, in denying perfonal courage to the Americans, we differ from the learned Dr Robert- fon ; who attributes their method of making war to a policy adapted to the fmallnefs of their number, and urges their defperate valour on fome extraordinary oc ■ cafions as a proof of their courage. To this it might eafily be replied, that, none will fight fo defperately as cowards, when they are prevented from running away; and, therefore, it was a maxim among the Spartans, never to purfue a flying enemy too clofely, “ left he fhould. think it better to fight, than run away.” Be- fides, favage cruelty hath in all ages been reckoned a America, fign of cowardice: and we believe there are but few, (in which number we would not wifh to include the’ Doftor) that will not ftigmatize, as the moft infamous cowards, thofe who will not face their enemies in the open field, but murder them, together with their help- 42 lefs women and infants, when afleep.

He applied himfelf par¬ ticularly to the ftudy of anatomy, and did more in that way than all that went before him.

He is faid to have made fome predictions relative to the phenomena of nature, upon which he wrote fome treatifes. His principal tenets may be reduced to the following. All things were in the beginning confu- fedly placed together, without order and without mo¬ tion. The principle of things is at the fame time one and multiplex, which obtained the name of komcemeries, or fimilar particles, deprived of life. But there is be- fide this, from all eternity, another principle, namely an infinite and incorporeal fpirit, who gave thefe par¬ ticles a motion ; in virtue of which, fuch as are homo- geneal united, and fuch as were heterogeneal feparated according to their different kinds.

The firft work of Andreas was his Glofs upon the fixth Book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote alfo Gloffes upon the Clementines; and a Commentary in regulas Sexti, which he intitled Mercuriales, becaufc he either engaged in it on Wednefdays (diebus Mercit- rii,) or becaufe he inferted his Wednefdays difputes in it.

Upon this he defired to be bapti¬ zed; and, in memory of the calling of St John and St Andrew, he received the name John Andreas. “ Ha¬ ving received holy orders (fayshe), and, from an alfaqui and a flave of Lucifer, become a prieft and minifter of Chrift; I began, like St Paul, to preach and publifh the contrary of what I had erroneoufly believed and afferted ; and, with the affiftance of Almighty God, AND Andreas J converted at firll a great many fouls of the Moors, (J'’bn) who were in danger of hell, and under the dominion Andrelinas Lucifer, and conduced them into the way of falva-    tion. After this, I was fent for by the moll catholic prince, king Ferdinand, and queen Ifabella, in order to preach in Granada to the Moors of that kingdom, which their majefties had conquered: by God’s blef- fing on my preaching, an infinite number of Moors were brought to abjure Mahomet, and to turn to Chrift. A little after this, I was made a canon by their grace; and fent for again by the moll Chriftian queen Ifabella to Arragon, that I might be employed in the converfion of the Moors of thofe kingdoms, who ftill perfifted in their errors, to the great contempt and dilhonour of our crucified Saviour, and the prodigious lofs and danger of all Chriftian princes. But this ex¬ cellent and pious defign of her majefty was rendered in- effe£lual by her death.” At the defire of Martin Gar¬ cia, bilhop of Barcelona, he undertook to tranllate from the Arabic, into the language of Arragon, the whole law of the Moors ; and after having finilhed this undertaking, he compofed his famous work of Ths Confufton of the Sett of Mahumed; it contains twelve chapters, wherein he has collefted the fabulous ftories, impoftures, forgeries, brutalities, follies, obfcenities, absurdities, impoflibilities, lies, and contradi&ions, which Mahomet, in order to deceive the fimple peo¬ ple, has difperfed in the writings of that feft, and e- fpecially in the alcoran, which, as he fays, was revealed to him in one night by an angel, in the city of Meke; though in another place he contradicts himfelf, and af¬ firms that he was 20 years in compofing it.

"No doubt, Trajan, who was an eye-witnefs of this terrible calamity, would contribute largely towards the re-eftablilhment of Antioch in its ancient fplendor. Its good fortune, however, did not continue long; for in 155, it was almoft entirely burnt by accidental fire; when it was again reftored by Antoninus Pius. In 176 or 177, the inhabitants having fided with Caflius, the abovementioned Roman general, who had revolted from M. Aurelius, that emperor publifhed a fevere edi£t a- gainft them, deprived them of all their privileges, fup- prefled their public affemblies, and took from them the fhews and fpeftacles to which they were greatly addic¬ ted: but his anger being foon appeafed, he reftored them to their former condition, and even condefcended to vifit their city.

"When the power of the Roman empire began to de¬ cline, Antioch became the bone of contention between them and the eaftern nations; and accordingly, on the breaking out of a Perfian war, it was almoft always fure to fufler. In 242, it was taken and plundered by Sapor; and, though he was defeated by Gordian, it un¬ derwent the fame misfortune in the time of Valerian, about 18 years after; and after the defeat and capti¬ vity of Valerian, being taken by the Perfian monarch a third time, he not only plundered it, but levelled all the public buildings with the ground. The Perfians, however, being foon driven out, this unfortunate city continued free from any remarkable calamity till about the time of the divifion of the Roman empire by Con- ftantine in 3.31. It was then afflicted with fo grievous a famine, that a bulhel of wheat was fold for 400 pieces of filver.

When the emperor Julian fet out on his expedition againft the Perfians, he made a long flay at Antioch; during which time, many of the Ro¬ man provinceswere affli&ed with a famine, but which raged more violently at Antioch than in other places","Antioch, Antioch",US,2,United States,North America
"The ecclefiaftic writers of thofe times fay, that this fa¬ mine followed Julian from place to place; and as he continued longer at Antioch than any other city, it raged more violently there than any where elfe. To re¬ medy this evil, Julian fixed the prices of corn, by which means the famine was greatly increafed, the merchants conveying their corn privately to other places, fo that this metropolis was reduced to a moft deplorable fitu- ation. In 381, in the reigrt of Theodofius the Great, Antioch was again vifited by a famine, accompanied by a grievous plague. The latter foon ceafed: but, the fa¬ mine ftill continuing, the biftiop, LibaniuS, applied to Icarius, count of the Eaft, requeft'ing him by fome means or other to relieve the poor, who had flocked from all parts to the metropolis, and were daily periih- ing in great numbers ; but to this Icarius gave no o- ther anfwer, than that they were abhorred and juftly puniftied by the gods. This inhuman anfwer railed great difturbances ; which, however, were terminated without bloodihed. In 387, Theodofius finding his exchequer quite drained, and being obliged to be at an extraordinary expence in celebrating the fifth year of the reign of his fon Arcadius, and the tenth of his own, an extraordinary tax was laid upon all the people in the empire. Moft: of the cities fubmitted willingly to this: but the people of Antioch, complaining of it as an un- reafonable oppreffion, crowded to the houfe of Flavia- nus their biihop, as foon as the edift was publiftied, to implore his proteftion. Being unable to find him, they returned to the forum; and would have torn the gover¬ nor in pieces, had not the officers who attended him kept back with great difficulty the enraged multitude, till he made his efcape. Upon this, they broke fome of the emperor’s ftatues and dragged others through the city, uttering the moft; injurious andabufive expref- fions againft him and his whole family. They were, however, difperfed by a body of archers, who, by wound¬ ing only two of the rabble, ftruck terror into all the reft. The governor proceeded againft the offenders with the utmoft cruelty; expofing fome to wild beafts in the theatre, and burning others alive. He did not fpare even the children, who had infulted the emperor’s fta¬ tues ; and caufed feveral perfons to be executed, who had been only fpeftators of the diforder. In the mean time, a report was fpread, that a body of troops was at hand, with orders.to plunder the city, and put all to the fword, without diftinftion of fex or age; upon which, the citizens abandoned their dwellings in the utmoft: terror and confufion, retiring to the neighbouring moun¬ tains with their wives and families.

On hearing the news of this tumult, Theodofius was fo much enraged, that he commanded the city to be deftroyed, and its in¬ habitants to be put to the fword without diftinftion ; but this order was revoked before it could be put into execution, and he contented himfelf with a puniftunent fimilar to that inflifted by Severus above-mentioned","Antioch, Antioch, Antioch",US,2,United States,North America

"In the year 170, Antoninus made vaft preparations againft the Germans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is faid to have happened, which, according to Dion Caflius, was as follows: Antoninus’s army being block¬ ed up by the Quadi, in a very difadvantageous place, where there was no poffibility of procuring water; in this fituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppreffed with heat and thirft, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an inftant the Iky was co¬ vered with clouds, and there fell a vaft quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thirft, when the enemy came upon them with fuch fury, that Antoninus they muft certainly Lave been defeated, had it not been for a fliower of hail, accompanied with a ftorm of thun¬ der and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the leaft annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the vidfory (b). ^In 175, Antoninus made a .treaty with feveral nations of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Caffius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor : this infurreftion, however, was put an end to by the death of Caflius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards thofe who had been engaged in Caflius’s p^r- ty : he would not put to death, nor imprifon, nor even fit in judgment himfelf upon any of the fenators enga- ed in this revolt; but he referred them to the fenate, xing a day for their appearance, as if it had been on¬ ly a civil affair. He wrote alfo to the fenate, defiririg them to a£b with indulgence rather than feverity; not to filed the blood of any fenator or perfon of quality, or of any other perfon whatfoever, but to allow this ho¬ nour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loft their lives, except in the firft heat of the tumult. In 176, Antoninus vifited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thofe countries, and ambaf- fadors alfo from Parthia, came to vifit him. He ftaid feyeral days at Smyrna; and, after he had fettled the affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his fon Commodus, whom, he chofe conful for the year fol¬ lowing, though he was then but 16 years of age, ha¬ ving obtained a difpenfation for that purpofe. On the 27th of September, the fame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commodus, on account of the vi&ories gained over the Germans. Dion Caflius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himfelf and the public treafury during 46 years, from the time that Hadrian had granted the fame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thofe debts. He applied himfelf likewife to correct many enormities, and introduced feveral excellent regulations. In the year 179, he left Rome with his fon Commodus, in order to go againft the Marcomanni, and other barba¬ rous nations; and the year following gained a confider- able vi&ory over them, and would, in all probability, have entirely fubdued them in a very ftiort time, had he not been taken with an illnefs, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign.

"Wa'' Antoninus’s Wall, the name of the third rampart or defence that had been built oi1 repaired by the Romans againft the incurfions of the North Britons. It is call¬ ed by the people in the neighbourhood, Graham's Dyke; from the notion that one Graham, or Grimus, firft made a breach in it after the retreat of the Romans out of Bri¬ tain. The firft barrier erefted by the Romans was the t Sec dgri- chain of forts made by Agricola f from the frith of cola. porth to that of Clyde, in the year 81, to proteft his conquefts from the inroads of the Caledonians. The * See Adri- fecon(j was the vallum, or dyke, flung up by Adrian * in the year 121. It terminated on the weftern fide of the kingdom, at Axelodunum, or Brugh, on the Solway fands; and was fuppofed to have reached no further than Pons JElii, or Newcajlle, on the eaftern. But from an infeription lately difeovered, it appears to have ex- 4 See Seve- tended as far as the wall of Severus if. This rampart m' of Adrian’s was fituated much further fouth than A- gricola’s chain; the country to the north having been either, according to fome authors, recovered by the na¬ tive Britons after the departure of Agricola; or, ac¬ cording to others, voluntarilyflighted by Adrian. How¬ ever, this work of Adrian’s did not long continue to be the extreme boundary of the Roman territories to the north in Britain. For Antoninus Pius, the adopted fon and immediate fucceffor of Adrian, having, by his lieutenant Lollius Urbicus, recovered the country once conquered by Agricola, commanded another rampart to be erefted between the friths of Forth and Clyde, in the trail where Agricola had formerly built his chain of forts. The great number of inferiptions which have been found in or near the ruins of this wall, or rampart, to the honour of Antoninus Pius, leave us no room to doubt its having been built by his direction and com¬ mand. If the fragment of a Roman pillar with an in¬ feription, now in the college library of Edinburgh, be¬ longed to this work, as it is generally fuppofed to have done, it fixes the date of its execution to the third confullhip of Antoninus, which was A. D. 140, only 20 years after that of Adrian, of which this feems to have been an imitation. This wall or rampart, as fome imagine, reached from Caer-ridden on the frith of Forth, to Old Kirkpatrick on the Clyde; or, as o- thers think, from Kinniel on the eaft, to Dunglafs on the weft. Thefe different fuppofitions hardly make a mile of difference in the length of this work, which, from feveral ailual menfurations, appears to have been 37 Englilh or 40 Roman miles. Capitolinus, in his life of Antoninus Pius, diredlly affirms, that the wall which that emperor built in Britain was of turf. This in the main is unqueftionably true; though it is evident (from the veftiges of it ftill remaining, which not very many years ago were dug up and examined for near a mile together) that the foundation was of ftone. Mr Cam¬ den alfo tells us, from the papers of one Mr Anthony Pont, that the principal rampart was faced with fquare ftone, to prevent the earth from falling into the ditch","Wa, Graham, Graham, Adrian, Adrian, Adrian, Adrian, Roman, Adrian, Roman, Edinburgh, Adrian, Roman","US,RO,GH,GB",2,"United States,Romania,Ghana,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Africa,Europe"
"The chief parts of this work were as follows : 1. A broad and deep ditch, whofe d’menfions cannot now be difeovered with certainty and exa&nefs, tho’ Mr Pont fays it was 12 feet wide. 2. The principal wall or rampart was about 12 feet thick at the foundation, but its original height cannot now be determined. This wall was fituated on the fouth brink of the ditch. 3. A military way on the fouth fide of the principal wall, Antoninus'd well paved, and raifed a little above the level of the Wal1- • ground. This work, as well as that of Adrian, was ~| defended by garrifons placed in forts and ftations along the line of it. The number of thefe forts or ftations, whofe veftiges were vifible in Mr Font’s time, were 18, fituated at about the diftance of two miles from each other. In the intervals between the forts, there were turrets or watch-towers. But the number of thefe, and their diftance from each other, cannot now be dif¬ eovered",Adrian,US,2,United States,North America
"Though we cannot difeover exactly how many years this wall of the emperor Antoninus continued to be the ANT [ 499 ] ANT i Antonio, the boundary of the Roman territories In Britain, yet |r"" we know with certainty that It was not very long. For 'we are told by an author of undoubted credit, that, in the reign of Commodus, A. D. 180, “ he had wars with feveral foreign nations, but none fo danger- (Dio. 1. 7*. ous as that of Britain. For the people of the illand, ba- p 8l0, ving palled the wall which divided them from the Ro¬ mans, attacked them, and cut them in pieces.” ANTONIO (Nicholas), knight of the order of St James and canon of Seville, did great honour to the Spanilh nation by his Bibliotheque of their writers. He was born at Seville, in 16x7, being the fon of a gentle¬ man whom king Philip IV. made prefident of the ad¬ miralty eftablilhed in that city in 1626. After having gone through a courfe of philofophy and divinity in his own country, he went to ftudy law at Salamanca, where he clofely attended the lectures of Francifco Ramos del Manzano, afterwards counfellor to the king, and pre¬ ceptor to Charles II. Upon his return to Seville, after he had finilhed his law-ftudies at Salamanca, he Ihut himfelf up in the royal monaftery of Benedi&ines, where he employed himfelf feveral years in writing his Bibliotheca Hifpanica, having the ufe of the books of Bennet de la Sana, abbot of that monaftery, and dean of the faculty of divinity at Salamanca. In the year 1659, he was fent to Rome by king Philip IV. in the character of agent-general from this prince : he had al- fo particular commiffions from the inquifition of Spain, the viceroys of Naples and. Sicily, and the governor of Milan, to negociate their affairs at Rome. The cardi¬ nal of Arragon procured him, from pope Alexan¬ der VII. a canonry in the church of Seville, the in¬ come whereof he employed in charity and purchafing of books: he had above 30,000 volumes in his library","Roman, Salamanca, Salamanca, Salamanca, Rome, Naples, Rome","MX,US,ES,RO",2,"Mexico,United States,Spain,Romania","North America,North America,Europe,Europe"
"By this help, joined to continual labour and indefa¬ tigable application, he was at laft enabled to finifh his Bibliotheca Hifpanica, in four volumes in folio, two of which he publilhed at Rome in the year 1672. The work conftfts of,two parts; the one containing the Spa- ni(h writers who flouriftied before the 15 th century, and the other thofe fince the end of that century. Af- ; ter the publication of thefe two volumes, he was re¬ called to Madrid by king Charles II. to take upon him the office of counfellor to the crufade; which he dif- charged with great integrity till his death, which hap¬ pened in 1684. He left nothing at his death but his vaft library, which he had brought from Rome to Madrid; and his two brothers, and nephews, being unable to pu- blilh the remaining volumes of his Bibliotheca, fent them to cardinal d’Aguifne, who paid the charge of the impreffion, and committed the care thereof to Mon- fieur Marti, his librarian, who added notes to them, in the name of the cardinal","Rome, Madrid, Rome, Madrid","US,ES",2,"United States,Spain","North America,Europe"
"While he filled the office of praetor, Sicily fell to his- lot, and he cleared the feas of the pirates which infeft- ed that coaft. He was made conful with A. Pofthumi- us Albinus, in the year of Rome 653; when he oppo- fed the turbulent defigns of Sextus Titus, tribune of the people, with great refolution and fuccefs. Some time after, he was made governor of Cilicia, in quality of proconful; where he performed fo many great ex¬ ploits, that he obtained the honour of a triumph. We cannot omit obferving, that, in order to improve his great talent for eloquence, he became a fcholar to the greateft men at Rhodes and Athens, in his way to Ci¬ licia, and when on his return to Rome. Soon after, he was appointed cenfor ; which office he difeharged with great reputation, having carried his caufe before the people, againft Marcus Duronius, who had preferred an accufation of bribery againft him, in revenge for Antonius’s having erafed his name out of the lift of fe~ nators* ANT [ 500 ] ANT nators, which this wife cenfor had done, becaufe Du- ronius, when tribune of the people, had abrogated a law which reftrained immoderate expence in feafts. He was one of the greateft orators ever known at Rome ; and it was owing to him, according to the teftimony of Cicero, that Rome might boaft herfelf a rival even to Greece itfelf in the art of eloquence. He defended, a- mongftmany others, Marcus Aquilius; and moved the judges in fo fenfible a manner, by the tears he fhed, and the fears he (hewed upon the breaft of his client, that he carried his caufe. He never would publifti any of his pleadings, that he might not, as he faid, be proved to fay in one caufe, what might be contrary to what he (hould advance in another. He affedted to be a man of no learning. His modefty, and many other qualifications, rendered him no lefs dear to many per- fons of diftindlion, than his eloquence made him uni- verfally admired. He was unfortunately killed du¬ ring thofe bloody confuiions raifed at Rome by Marius and Cinna. He was difeovered in the place where he hid himfelf, and foldiers were fent to difpatch him ; but his manner of addreffmg them had fuch an effedt, that none but he who commanded them, and had not heard his difeourfe, had the cruelty to kill him.

"ANTONIUS (Marcus) the triumvir, grandfon to the former, was very handfome in his youth""; for which reafon he was greatly beloved by Curio a fenator, who, by carrying him about in all his debaucheries, made him contract fuch heavy debts, that his own father forbad •him his houfe. Curio, however, was fo generous as to bail him for 250 talents. When the civil war broke ■out, Curio took Csefar’s party, and prevailed with An- tonius to do the fame; for which he was made a tribune of the people, and in that office did Casfar great fer- vice. Caefar, having made himfelf mafter of Rome, gave Antonius the goverment of Italy: at the battle of Pharfalia, Caefar confided fo much in him, that he gave him the command of the left wing of his army, whilft he himfelf led the right. After Caefar was made dic¬ tator, he made Antonius general of the horfe, though he had never been praetor; in which command he ex¬ erted his power with the utmoft violence. He was made conful, when Caefar enjoyed that honour for the fifth time, the laft year of that ufurper’s life. On Caefar’s death he harangued the populace with great art, and raifed their fury againft his murderers; flattering him¬ felf that he fliould eafily get into the place which Cas- far had filled : but his haughty behaviour made him lofe all the advantages his aifefted concern for Caefar had gained him. His ill treatment of Oftavius, and quarrel with him, produced another civil war; which ended in an accommodation between him, Odlavius, and Lepidus, fatal to the peace of Rome. They agreed to fhare the fupreme power among them; and many of the moft illuftrious Romans were facrificed by profeription to cement this bloody league, which is known by the name of the Second Triumvirate. But the triumvirs were too ambitious, and hated one another too much, to be long united. Antonius went into Afia to raife money for his foldiers; during his abfence, Fulvia his wife quarreled with Oftavius. When Antonius was in Afia, indulging himfelf in all manner of luxury, the fa¬ mous Cleopatra infpired him with the moft violent paf- fion. Hearing of the quarrel between Fulvia and 0<fta- vius, and finding O&avius was become publicly his enemy, Antonius entered into a confederacy with Sex¬ tus Pompeius, who was ftill mafter of Sicily. He then went into Italy in order to fight Oftavius; but Fulvia, who had been the author and promoter of this war, dying, Oftavius and Antonius came to an agreement","Rome, Rome","IT,US",2,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"One of the conditions of this new peace was, that they ffiould together attack Pompey, though the former had lately made an alliance with him. Antonius then mar¬ ried Oftavia, filler to Oftavius, as a pledge of their re¬ newed friendlhip ; but returned foon after to his belo¬ ved Cleopatra, and again lived with her in Alexandria",Alexandria,US,2,United States,North America
"Oftavius took hold of this pretence to inveigh againft him, and begin the war again. At laft they engaged in a fea-fight at Aftium, in which Oclavius gained a complete vi6tory; which was followed by the deaths both of Antonius and Cleopatra.

"In 1585, Antwerp underwent a remarkable fiege by the duke of Parma. It was then the moft wealthy city in the Netherlands, and had long been the objed of his defigns; but the difficulties attending the enterprize obliged him to poftpone it for a confiderable time",Parma,"NL,US",2,"Netherlands,United States","Europe,North America"
"In order to fucceed, it was neceffary to cut oft' the com¬ munication of the city with Holland, Ghent, and all places above and below Antwerp on the Scheld. To effeClthis, he laid fiege to Lilkenffiouk and Tillo, places of the utmoft confequeuce to the fecurity and commerce of the city; both were obllinately defended ; and the fiege of the latter was raifed, after it had been carried on for three months: however, the duke gained feveral o- ther pods on the river, where he built forts, and great¬ ly annoyed the (hipping and trade of the city. He next laid fiege to Dendermonde, in order to cut off the communication with Ghent, in which he fucceeded by the reduiftion of the town. His next attempt was on Vilvorde: this place he took by affault, and thereby cut off the communication with Bruffels. Finding, however, this method of hemming in the city tedious, and ineffedlual while an opening to the mouth of the ri¬ ver remained, he formed a defign of building a bridge acrofs the Scheld, the extremities of which were to be defended by ftrong forts and out-works. Fie began with collefting great quantities of wood at Callo and fort St Philip, where he intended the bridge (hould be built; but his projedt was for fome time retarded by the Antwerpers, who broke down the dykes, overflowed Antwerp A !L,r ANT [ 502 1 A O R the whole country, and carried off his magazines by the inundation. Not difcouraged by this lofs, he ap¬ plied himfelf diligently to repair it, and with incredible expedition cut a canal from Steken to Callo, by which he carried off the waters. He then fet to work upon the bridge, and finifhed it in feven months, without any interruption from the Zealanders. During the building of this bridge, Aldegonde, governor of Ant¬ werp, propofed building a fort on Couvenfteyn dyke, in order to fecure that important poft, and then break¬ ing down the dyke, when the bridge was near finifhed: but he was violently oppofed by certain citizens, who apprehended that their lands and villas would be de- flroyed by the inundation. This unfeafonable oppofi- tion, with the negligence of the magiftrates, who, be- caufe the markets were high, had not laid in a fuffi- cient flock of corn, occafioned the lofs of the city","Holland, Dendermonde","US,BE",2,"United States,Belgium","North America,Europe"
"However, in defpite of all the duke of Parma’s pre¬ cautions, the Zealanders found means to throw in a convoy of corn: but the citizens, knowing they would not run the rifle of carrying it back again, fo cheapened the price, that thefe bold traders refufed ever to bring their goods again to fo bad a market. The Antwerp- ers, having thus through avarice brought on their ruin, began in a fhort time to fuffer by famine'; they then preffed the Zealanders to attempt fomething for their relief, but it was now too late. While the magiftrates were deliberating on feme means for deftroying the bridge, which they might have prevented from being ever completed, one Ginebelli, a Mantuan engineer, offered his fervices, undertaking at a certain expence to blow it into the air. Even in this extremity the ex¬ pence was grudged: but neceffity at laft overcame this obftacle; Ginebelli was furnifhed with two large vef- fels, a number of fmall boats, and every thing necef- fary. He formed the two large veffels into fire-fhips, which he fet adrift with the ftream, deceiving the ene¬ my by means of falfe fires lighted up in the fleet of fmall boats. The train of one of the fire-fhips was ex¬ pended before the time expe&ed, and fhe blew up with a terrible explofion, but with little.damage to the bridge",Parma,US,2,United States,North America
"The other was more fuccefsful, carrying off all the out¬ works, fetting fire to the whole bridge, and burying above 500 foldiers in the ruins it made. The fire how¬ ever was foon extinguifhed, and the bridge repaired by the duke of Parma, while the Antwerpers were pre • vented by avarice from repeating the experiment; fo that they were foon reduced to the greateft ftraits, and obliged to furrender. It is faid that the city of Amfterdam had obftrufted every meafure for the relief of Antwerp, hoping to profit by its deftru&ion. It was not doubted but the proteftants would forfake it as foon as it fell into the hands of an arbitrary catho¬ lic prince; and this conjefture was foon fulfilled by the removal of many families with their effefts to Amfter¬ dam.—After the battle of Ramillies, the city of Ant¬ werp furrendered to the duke of Marlborough.

At the bottom, on one fide, ran the river Indus ; on the top was a fine plain, part of which was covered with a thick wood; the reft arable land, with a fountain furniftiing abundance of excellent water. This rock was taken by Alexander the Great, in whofe time there was a report that Hercules had at¬ tempted it in vain; however, according to Arrian, this report was without foundation. It is probable indeed, that it was raifed after the place was taken, in order to magnify Alexander’s exploit. While the Macedo¬ nian monarch was preparing all things neceffary for the fiege, an old man with his two fons, who had long li¬ ved in a cave near the fummit, came and offered to (hew him a private way of afcending.

"Apollinaris Sxdonius (Cains Sollius), an eminent Chriftian writer and biftiop in the 5th century, was born of a noble family in France. He was educatedT under the bell mailers, and made a prodigious pro- grefs in the feveral arts and fciences, but particularly in poetry and polite literature. After he had left the fchools, he applied himfelf to the profeffion of war. He married Papianilla, the daughter of Avitus, who was conful, and afterwards emperor, by whom he had three children. But Majorianus in the year 457 having de¬ prived Avitus of the empire, and taken the city of Lyons, in which our author refided, Apollinaris fell into the hands of the enemy. However, the reputation of his learning foftened Majorianus’s refentments, fo that he treated him with the utmoft civility, in return for which Apollinaris compofed a panegyric in his ho¬ nour ; which was fo highly applauded, that he had a ftatue erefted to him at Rome, and was honoured with the title of Count.

"Whether Apollo was ever a real perfonage, or only the great luminary, many have doubted. Indeed, Vof- fius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a metaphorical being, and that there never was anyo- ther Apollo than the fun. “ He was ftyled the fon of Jupiter, (fays this author), becaufe that god was rec¬ koned by the ancients the author of the world. His mother was called Latona, a name which fignifies hid¬ den; becaufe, before the fun was created, all things were wrapped up in the obfeurity of chaos. He is always reprefented as beardlefs and youthful, becaufe the fun never grows old or decays. And what elfe can his bow and arrows imply, but his piercing beams And adds, “ that all the ceremonies which were per¬ formed to his honour, had a manifeft relation to the great fource of light, which he reprefented. Whence (he concludes) it is in vain to feek for any other divi¬ nity than the fun, which was adored under the name of Apollo.” However, though this is in general true, yet it does appear, from many paflages in ancient authors, that there was fome illuftrious perfonage named Apollo, who, after his apotheofis, was taken for the fun; as Ofiris and Orus in Egypt, whofe exiftence cannot be called in queftion, were, after their death, confounded with the fun, of which they became the fymbols, either from the glory and fplendor of their reigns, or from a belief that their fouls had taken up their refidence in that luminary",Jupiter,"EG,US",2,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"Of the four Apollo’s mentioned by Cicero, it ap¬ pears that the three laft were Greeks, and the firft an Egyptian ; who, according to Herodotus, was the fon of Ofiris and Ifis, and called Orus.

The teftimony of Dio¬ dorus Siculus is ftill more exprefs; for in fpeaking of Ifis, after faying that (he had invented the practice of medicine, he adds, that ftie taught this art to her fon Orus, named Apollo, who was the laft of the gods that reigned in Egypt","Of, Cicero","EG,TR,US",2,"Egypt,Turkey,United States","Africa,Asia,North America"
"It is eafy to trace almoft all the Grecian fables and mythologies from Egypt. If the Apollo of the Greeks was faid to be the fon of Jupiter, it was becaufe Orus the Apollo of the Egyptians had Ofiris for his father, whom the Greeks confounded with Jupiter. If the Greek Apollo was reckoned the god of eloquence, mu- lic, medicine, and poetry, the reafon was, that Ofiris, who was the fymbol of the fun among the Egyptians, as well as his fon Orus, had there taught thofe liberal arts. If the Greek Apollo was the god and conduc¬ tor of the mufes, it was becaufe Ofiris carried with him in his expedition to the Indies finging women and mu¬ ficians.

But what moft e- ftablifhed the impoftor’s affairs, and was indeed the true foundation of all his future greatnefs, was his gain¬ ing the battle of Bedr, of which we have the follow¬ ing account. The prophet being informed that Abu Sofian Ebn Harb efcorted a caravan of the Koreifh with only 30 or 40 men, refolved to advance at the head of a fmall detachment of his troops to intercept it. To this he was excited by the riches of the cara¬ van, which confifted of a large quantity of merchan¬ dize, confifting of the riches of Syria, carried on the backs of a thoufand camels.

Upon this he recommended himfelf to the prophet’s prayers, and remounted his horfe without hurt : but, as he ftill continued the purfuit, his horfe fell down with him a fecond time; upon which he re¬ turned to Mecca, without offering any further violence; and Mahomet, thus happily delivered from the greateft dangers, arrived without further moleftation at Medina, where he was received with the greateft demonftrations of joy.—This flight of the prophet from Mecca to Me¬ dina was reckoned fo remarkable by the Mcflems, that they made it the sera from whence all their remarkable tranfa&ions were dated; calling it the Mr a c,f the Hegira, or flight.

To do this the more effe&ually, they accufed Mahomet and his followers of fpeaking difrefpe&fully of Jesus, and of his mother Mary ; which accufation they ho¬ ped would likewife induce him to deliver up the Mof- lem refugees that were then at his court. But the bad fuccefs that had attended the arms of the Koreifti hi¬ therto, joined to the excufes made by the refugees, not only hindered the Najafhi from delivering them up, but alfo prompted him to difinifs the ambafladors, and return the prefents they had brought him. In the mean time, Abu Sofian, who had fworn never to ufe perfumes or enjoy women till he had another battle with Mahomet, fet out from Mecca with a body of two hundred horfe. He advanced to a poft within three miles of Medina; from whence he fent a detachment, who burnt a barn, together with a man in it that was winnowing wheat.

"The next year, (A. D. 626), Mahomet, befides fe- veral other lefs confiderable fuccefles, reduced a fortrefs belonging to the Jewifli tribe of A1 Nadir, who had revolted on account of the defeat at Ohod: on this occafion, by an exprefs revelation, as he pretended, he kept the whole booty to himfelf; and, about the fame time, forbad his followers the ufe of wine, or to play at games of chance, on account of the difturbances and quarrels which were likely to be excited by that means among them. This year alfo he marched with a body of infantry to Bedr; to meet Abu Sofian, as he had promifed the year before : but that general’s heart fail¬ ing. him, he returned home without facing the prophet; and this piece of cowardice the Modems did not fail to S1 impute to a terror fent immediately from God. The of Me-year following, however, the Koreifh, in conjunction with the tribe of Ghatfan, and the Jews of A1 Nadir and Koreidha, aflembled an army of 12,000 men, with which they formed the fiege of Medina; thus threaten¬ ing the impoftor and all his followers with utter de- ftru&ion at once.

The Arabs having invefted the town, both Tides remained in a ftate of in- aftivity for fome time, which was fo well employed by pointed ; for Saad, being highly provoked at them for affifting the Koreifh, while in league with Mahomet, ordered the men to be put to the fword, the women and children made flaves, and their goods divided a- mong the Moflems. This fentence was no fooner heard by Mahomet, than he cried out that Saad had yt pronounced the fentehce of God ; and, in confequence KhordJ- of this decifion, ordered the men, to the number of Nfes mafTa- 600 or 700; to be immediately maflacred.

"This was done by communicating fome poifon to a (houlder of mutton, of which one of his companions na¬ med Bajhar Ebn Al Bara, eating heartily, died upon the fpot; and Mahomet himfelf, though he recovered a little, and lived three years after, yet never enjoyed perfect health. Notwithstanding this misfortune, how¬ ever, he itill continued his enterprizes. The year 630 proved remarkably fortunate. It was uthered in by the converfion of Khalid Ebn A1 Walid, Amru Ebn A1 As, and Othman Ebn Telha, three of the moft confiderable perfons among the Koreith; and this foon 53 enabled him to become mafter of the whole peninfula Meccans of Arabia.

Upon this, he applied to Abu Beer, AH, Omar, and Fatima, to intercede for their countrymen with the prophet ; but fome of thefe giving him rough anfwers, and others none at all, he was obliged to re¬ turn to Mecca as he came. Mahomet immediately gave orders -for the necelfary preparations, that he might fur- prife the Meccans, who were by no means in a condition to receive him ; but Hateb Ebn Abu Bahaa, hitherto a faithful Modem, attempted to give them notice of their danger by a letter, though without efFedl.

After the firft impreffions of their fear, however, were over, they began to meditate a revolt; but were prevented by one Sohail Ebn Amru, a prin¬ cipal man of the Koreifh. The tumults at Medina, how¬ ever, were not fo eafily appeafed. The news of this fad event was no fooner publifhed there, than a number of people affembled before his door, crying out, “ How can our apoftle be dead ? Our interceffor, our media¬ tor, has not entirely left us! He is taken up into hea¬ ven, as was Ifa (Jefus); therefore he fhallnot be buried.” This was confirmed by Omar; who drew his fword, and fwore, that, if any perfon affirmed Mahomet to be dead, he would cut off his hands and his feet. “ The apof¬ tle of God, fays he, is not dead: he is only gone for a feafon, as Mofes the fon of Amran was gone from the people of Ifrael for forty days, and then returned to them again.” The populace therefore kept the body above ground, even after the belly began to fwell; nor could the prophet’s uncle A1 Abbas, notwithftand- ing this, convince them to the contrary.

From Tarma he marched to Mefr, the Memphis of the ancient geo¬ graphers; which, after a fiege of feven months, was de¬ livered up to him by the treachery of A1 Mokawkas the governor.

But this method of conveying corn proving too tedious and ex- penfive, he ordered him to clear the Amnis Trajanus of Ptolemy, now the Khalis, which runs from one end of Cairo to the other, of the fand and gravel with which it was choked. This he accordingly did, and by that means rendered the communication between Egypt and Arabia much more eafy than it had formerly been. p(j While the Arabs thus extended their conquefts in The Fer¬ tile weft, they were no lefs fuccefsful in the eaft.

The chief of thefe were, That he had recalled one who had been ba- nifhed by the prophet; that he had removed Saad, an officer of diilinguifhed bravery, and fupplied his place by one who drank wine, and was otherwife of a fcan- dalous life ; that he had fquandered away vaft fums a- mong his favourites ; that he had removed Amru from the government of Egypt, to which he had preferred his own fofter-brother; and, laftly, that he had pre- 4 B 2 fumed A R A [ 568 ] A R A Arabia, fumed to fit on the top of Mahomet’s pulpit, whereas Abu Beer had always fat on the higheft ftep, and Omar on the loweft. To this formidable accufation the poor khalif pleaded guilty, and promifed to make all the re¬ paration in his power; but his condefcenfion only fer- ved to increafe the infolence of the rebels. They were however appeafed by Ali; and public tranquillity had undoubtedly been reftored, had it not been for Ayefha, one of Mahomet’s widows, who procured the deftruc- tion of the khalif by a fcheme truly worthy of the wife of fuch an huiband. That traitrefs, being defirous of raifing one of her favourites named Telha to the digni¬ ty of khalif, prevailed on Merwan thefecretary offtate to write a letter to the prefect of Egypt, enjoining him to put to death Mahomet Ebn Abu Beer, with whom it was fent, and who was to be his fucceffor.

"The empire of Alexander the great, which arofe with Hill more rapidity than that of the Arabs, had nofup- port but from his own ambition and perfonal qualifi¬ cations. While he lived, he was without a rival, be- caufe all were afraid of him ; but when he died, the bands of union, whereby his empire had been held to¬ gether, were immediately diffolved. His captains were not infpired with the fame veneration for his fon, who was unborn at the time of his death, that they had for his father; and therefore they fought not to conquer for him, but for themfelves; and the confequence was, that the kingdom fell to pieces the moment that he died. The fame thing happened to the empires of Jenghiz Khan, Tamerlane, and others, who made vail conquells in a Ihort time. They eredled mighty em¬ pires indeed; but their duration, we may fay, was but momentary.. The empire of the Romans was founded on a kind of enthufiaflic defire of aggrandizing the city Arabia, of Rome : patriotifrn became falhionable ; and as the 1 i! city never ceafed to exift, thofe who conquered always had the fame end in view, namely to exalt the republic more and more. This empire therefore was not only very extenfive, but very durable; though, as it was im- poffible that mankind could always continue to vene¬ rate a city, the fame divifions that ruined other em¬ pires, at lall brought this to an end.—The foundation of Mahomet’s empire feemed to be Hill more firm. He was not only the king, but, we may fay, the God of his people. Whatever enthufiafm people may Ihew in defending their country, nay even their neareft rela¬ tions, experience has taught us, that it is greatly infe¬ rior to what is Ihewn by thofe who fight in defence of religion. This enthufiafm Mahomet had taken care, not only to bring over to his fide, but to exalt to its highell pitch, by inculcating upon his followers, that their rewards in the next world Ihould be proportion- able to the fury with which they fought in this. To live at peace, except with thofe who fubmitted to his will, did not at all enter into his plan; and he who made no conquells, or at leall did not llrive to make them, was no true believer. By this means, let his empire be ever fo much extended, the temptation to making frelh conquells was Hill equally llrong; and not only the commanders of armies, but every private per- fon, had the moll powerful motives to urge him towards the conquell of the whole world, had that been pof- fible.—The only thing Mahomet feems to have failed Caufes of in, was the appointment of the fucceflion to the apollle- the decline 1 j Ihip; and why he was deficient in this, is inconceivable. of t*ie M°f- From this one fource proceeded the divifions which *em emPire~ ruined his empire when it was fcarce ere£led, and of which we are now to give the hillory",Rome,US,2,United States,North America

He wrote this poem in Greek verfe: it was tranflated into Latin by Cicero ; who tells us, in his firltbook De oratore, that the verfes of A- ratus are very noble. This piece was tranflated by o- thers as well as Cicero ; there being a tranflation by Germanicus Csefar, and another into elegant verfe by Feftus Avienus.

"When the Arabs conquered Spain, they introduced a mode of architedlure which was juft the reverfe of the Gothic. This was as remarkable for its lightnefs as the Gothic was for its clumfinefs ; and the fantaftic genius of the Arabs difplayed itfelf in the great number of fuperfluous and unnatural ornaments wherewith it was loaded. Examples of this kind of building are extant in fome cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors, par¬ ticularly that of Burgos. It is falfely, though com¬ monly, called the modern Gothic. zx In the 15th and 16th centuries, when learning of all Revival of kinds began to revive, architedlure feemed as it were 1116 art- to be recalled intodife. The firft improvements in it began in Italy, and owed their exiftence to the many ruins of the ancient Roman flrudlures that were to be found in that country, from whence an improved me¬ thod of building was gradually brought into the other countries of Europe: and though the Italians for a long time retained the fuperionty as architedls over the other European nations; yet, as men of genius tra¬ velled from all quarters into Italy, where they had an opportunity of feeing the originals from whence the Italians copied, architedls have arifen in other nations equal, if not fuperior, to any that ever appeared in I- taly.

"We /hall conclude this hiftory with an account of the mode of architedlure followed by thofe nations who never had any connedlion either with the Jews, Greeks, or Romans, and whofe manner of building muft confe- quently be reckoned quite original, and peculiar to themfelves. Thefe nations are the Chinefe, the Ameri¬ cans, and the ancient Celtes; by the laft of which the ifland of Britain moft probably was firft peopled. The firft are a very ingenious people, and pretend to very high antiquity ; but their architedlure is univerfally al¬ lowed to be much inferior to that of the Greeks and Romans. It is true, they excelled the ancient Egyp- Chinei'e tians in knowing the method of conlirndling arches ; but though they make ufe of arches in confirudling bridges, and build fome of thefe of a prodigious height and.length, they feem ftrangely deficient in the know¬ ledge of finifhing them with propriety. Their method of building them is as follows.’ As foon as they finilh the fides of the arch next to the land, or, if there are more arches than one, as foon as they finilh the piers that Hand between them, they proceed to lay on the Hones (which are commonly about four or five feet long, and half a foot broad', alternately upright and croflwife, fo that the key-ftones always lie horizon¬ tally. The top of the arch is ufually no thicker than thefe ftones ; and becaufe the bridges, efpecially thofe that have but one arch, are fometimes 40 or 50 feet between the piers, and confequently much higher than the caufeway, they make an afeent on both fides by Heps about three inches thick; the inconvenience of which for horfes and carriages is very evident. In other refpefts, however, the Chinefe bridges are well built, and fome of them exceedingly beautiful. One in particular, near Pekin, was built of white marble curioully wrought and polilhed. It had 70 pillars on each fide, divided by cartridges of fine marble, beautifully carved with flowers, foliage, birds, beafts, and a variety of other ornaments. On each fide of the entrance on the bridge, at the call end, Hood two lions of an extraordinary fize, on two marble pedeftals, with feveral other fmaller lions in different attitudes. At the other end of the bridge flood likewife two curious pedeftals, on which were Ikilfully carved two children ; and all the reft of 602 A R C H I T the workmtinfhip was anfwerable to it",Pekin,US,2,United States,North America
"In the kingdom of Mexico, many magnificent cities and temples are faid to have been found by the Spa¬ niards ; but, as not the leaft yeftiges of any fuch build¬ ings are now to be feen, it may juttly be queftioned whether they ever had an exiftence. Nor do even the exaggerated defcriptions of the Spanifli writers, when they defcend to particulars, tend to give us any high idea of their magnificence. As far as can be gather¬ ed from their obfeure and inaccurate defcriptions, the famous temple of Mexico was only a fquare mafs of earth partly faced with Hone. It was raifed to fuch a height, that the afcent to it was by a flair-cafe of 114 fteps. Its bafe extended 90 feet on each fide; and at the top it terminated in a quadrangle of 30 feet fquare, where were placed a fhrine of the Deity, and two al¬ tars on which the vi&ims were facrificed.

"Plutarch attributes the edablidimeut of the Areopa¬ gus to Solon. Other authors think differently: and with good reafon; for it appears undeniable, that this tribunal was indituted before Solon. But the bed au¬ thorities allow him the honour of its redoration. The city of Athens, governed till this time by tribunals of a circumfcribed jurifdiftion, which were multiplied by the mod trifling accidents and circumdances, took no fixed political or civil form, however clofely united the members of thofe tribunals were by their general view* towards the public good and by the common love of their country. As each of thofe tribunals could only aft in proportion to the power delegated to it, it was im- poflible that fo many different and unequal impreflions ffiould give to the great machine of the date that uni¬ form and regular movement which, by an impulfe al¬ ways the fame, would keep each part in the fituation it ihould maintain with relation to the whole","Solon, Solon, Athens",US,2,United States,North America
"To effeft this univerfal and harmonious power, it was neceffary to unite the different channels of public authority, which, by being too much didributed, lod its force. This authority Solon collefted, and placed it all in the court of Areopagus, which confequently became the main fpring of the government. The jud¬ ges of this court, who, under Draco, decided only in cafes of murder, now took cognizance of crimes of e- very kind ; and the fame tribunal which inflifted ca¬ pital puniihment on murder, poifoning, burning ofhou- fes, theft, &c. druck at the roots of thofe crimes, by arraigning idlenefs, luxury, and debauchery. Equally attentive to dimulate the indolence of the young, and the languor of the old, thefe fage judges roufed in the one the laudable ambition to ferve the date, and redo- red to the others their former aftivity. Satisfied that extremes produce the fame effefts, they thought the re¬ public had as much to fear from the excefs of wealth as from the gripe of poverty. Hence they exafted a mi¬ nute account of the effefts of every individual.

To give more force to his law, he fubjefted him- fielf to it, and was only admitted on that title.

Epimenides dedicated it a fecond time to the Furies, or fevere Godejfes, as they were termed by the Athenians. A man was thought loft without refource, and a victim to every human ill, if he enforced a per¬ jury by invoking the facred name of thofe tremendous divinities","Cicero, Athens",US,2,United States,North America
"As to the number of the judges which compofed the Areopagus, fome authors, attentive only to a part of Solon’s regulations, by which he enadled, that for the future, none but the nine archons Ihould be ad¬ mitted members of the Areopagus, have imagined that this tribunal was filled anew every year, and that it never confifted of more than nine magiftrates. This opinion, and fome others, are refuted by the circum- ftantial account which Diogenes Laertius gives us of the condemnation of Socrates. This great man had wilhed to fubftitute a rational hypothefis for the fa¬ bulous and extravagant fyftem of religion which pre¬ vailed in his time. His projeft, however laudable, ap¬ peared impious in the eye of fuperftition. Information was laid againft him before the Areopagus, and he had as many accufers as fellow-citizens. After the charges and the anfwets were heard, they proceeded to fuffrages; the opinions were divided, but not equal¬ ly, for the number of thofe who condemned him ex¬ ceeded by 281 the number of thofe who declared him innocent. He made an ironical reply to this iniqui¬ tous fentence, by telling hjs judges, that he took it for granted, they would admit him to a maintenance in the Prytanasum. On this farcafm, 80 of thofe who had voted in his favour forfook him, went over to the oppofite party, and condemned him to die.

"Of all the judgments of the Areopagus, the moft famous one, excepting that of Mars, was the fentence which they palled on Oreftes. His trial, which hap¬ pened under Demophon the 12th king of Athens, in 375 of the Attic sera, owed all its fame to a remark¬ able circumltance, that gave rife to a cuftom which was obferved ever afterwards. Oreftes had killed his mother; he was accufed before the Areopagus, and cited to appear in that court. He would have loft his life in confequence of the equal divifion of the votes, had not Minerva, moved with his misfortunes, declared herfelf for thofe who had abfolved him, and joined her fuffrage to theirs. Thus Oreftes was faved. In ve¬ neration to this miracle, the Areopagites, whenever the fuffrages were equally divided, decided in favour of the accufed, by granting him what they termed the Jhell of Minerva.

Socrates fent frequent exhortations to him, in order to reclaim him ; but all in vain : and with the fame view he publilhed that difcourfe which we find in Xenophon. Here Ariftippus became acquainted with Lais, the famous courtezan of Corinth; for whofe fake he took a voyage to that city.

"At another time, interceding with Dionyfius in behalf of a friend, but not prevailing, he caft himfelf at his feet: being reproved by one for that excefs of humility, he replied, “ That it was not he who was the caufe of that fubmiflion; but Dionyfius, whofe ears were in his feet.” Dionyfius (hewed him three beautiful courte¬ zans, and ordered him to take his choice. Upon which, he took them all three away with him, alleging that Paris was puniftied for preferring one to the other two but when he had brought them to his door, he difmif- fed them, in order to (hew that he could either enjoy or reject with the fame indifference.

"Species, Of this genus there are 21 different fpecies; but only the four following merit defeription. 1. The rotunda, is a native of the fouth of France, of Spain, and Italy, from whence the roots are brought for me¬ dicinal ufe. The roots are roundiih, grow to the fize of fmall turnips, being in fhape and colour like the roots of cyclamens, which are frequently fold inftead of them. This fort hath three or four weak trailing branches, which lie on the ground when they are not fupported, and extend two feet in length; the leaves are heart-ftiaped and rounded at their extremity ; the flowers come out fingly at every leaf, toward the upper part of the ftalk. They are of a purplifh black colour; and are frequently fucceeded by oval feed-veffels, ha¬ ving fix cells, full of flat feeds. 2. The longa, is a na¬ tive of the fame countries. This fpecies hath long tap¬ roots like carrots ; the branches are weak and trailing, extending little more than a foot; the flowers come out from the wings of the leaves like the other, are of a pale purple colour, and are frequently fucceeded by feed-veffels like the other. 3. The ferpentaria, is a na¬ tive of Virginia and Carolina, from whence radix Ariftolo- Jerpentarise, fo much ufed in medicine, is brought over. chia- The plant rifes out of the ground in one, two, and fometimes three pliant ftalks, which at every little di- ftance are crooked or undulated. The leaves ftand al¬ ternately, and are about three inches long, in form fomewhat like the fmilax afpera. The leaves grow clofe to the ground on footftalks an inch long, of a Angular fhape, and of a dark purple colour. A round canulated capfule fucceeds the flower. It is filled with feeds, which are ripe in May. The ufual price of the root when dried is 6 d. per ;pound, both in Virginia and Carolina, which is money hardly earned; yet the negro flaves employ great part of the time allowed them by their mafters in fearch of it, which is the reafon that there are feldom found any but very fmall plants of this fpecies.

"ARISTOPHANES, a celebrated comic poet of Athens. He was cotemporary with Plato, Socrates, and Euripides ; and moil of his plays were written during the Peloponnefian war. His imagination,was warm and lively, and his genius particularly turned to raillery: he had alfo great- fpirit and refolution ; and was a declared enemy to flavery, and to all thofe who wanted to opprefs their country. The Athenians fuf- fered themfelves in his time to be governed by men who had no other views than to make themfelves ma¬ tters of the commonwealth. Ariftophanes expcfed the defigns of thefe men, with great wit and feverity, upon the ftage. Cleo was the firft whom he attacked, in his- comedy of the Equites ; and as there was not one of the comedians who would venture to perfonate a man of his great authority, Ariftophanes played the character himfelf, and with fo much fuccefs, that the Athenians obliged Cleo to pay a fine of five talents, which were given to the poet. He defcribed the af¬ fairs of the Athenians in fo exa<tt a manner, that his comedies are a faithful hiftory of that people. For this reafon, when Dionyfius king of Syracufe deisred to learn the ftate and language of Athens, Plato fent him the comedies of Ariftophanes, telling him, thefe were the bett reprefentation thereof. He wrote above 50 comedies; but there are only 11 extant which are perfedt: thefe are, Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, E- quites, the Acharnenfes, the Wafps, Peace, the Birds, the Ecclefiazufae or Female Orators, the Thefmopho- fiazufe or Prieftefles of Ceres, and Lyfiftrata. The ' Clouds, which he wrote in ridicule of Socrates *, is the moft celebrated of all his comedies : Madam Dacier tells us, (he was fo much charmed with this perform¬ ance, that after (lie had tranflated it, and read it over 200 times, it did not become the lead tedious to her, which (he could not fay of any other piece; and that the pleafure which (he received from it was fo exqui- fite, that (he forgot all the contempt and indignation which Ariftophanes deferved for employing his wit to ruin a man, who was wifdom itfelf, and the greateft ornament of the city of Athens. Ariftophanes, having conceived fome averlion to the poet Euripides, fatirizes him in feveral of his plays, particularly in his Frogs and his T'hefmopbojiazufie. , He wrote his Peace in the 10th year of the Peloponnefian war, when a treaty for 50 years was concluded between the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians, though it continued but feven years","Athens, Plato, Athens, Plato, Ceres, Athens","US,CO,ZA",2,"United States,Colombia,South Africa","North America,South America,Africa"
"The Acharnenfes was written after the death of Pericles, and the lofs of the battle in Sicily, in order to diffuade the people from intruding the fafety of the common¬ wealth to fuch imprudent generals as Lamachus. Soon after, he reprefented his Aves, or Birds; by which he admoniftied the Athenians to fortify Decelsea, which he calls by a fictitious name Nephelococcygia. The Arifto- Vefpse, or Wafps, was written after another lofs in Sicily, which the Athenians fuffered from the mifeon- ■, , duct of Chares. He wrote the Lyjijlrata when all Greece was involved in a war ; in which comedy the women are introduced debating upon the affairs of the commonwealth, when they come to a refolution, not to go to bed with their hulbands till a peace (hould be concluded. His Plutus, and other comedies of that kind, were written after the magiftrates had given or¬ ders that no perfon (hould be expofed by name upon the ftage. He invented a peculiar kind of verfe, which w'as called by his name, and is mentioned by Cicero in his Brutus; and Suidas fays, that he alfo was the inventor of the tetrameter and oftameter verfe",Cicero,"GR,US",2,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"Ariftophanes was greatly admired among the an¬ cients, efpecially for the true Attic elegance of his ftyle. The time of his death is unknown ; but it is certain he was living after the expulfion of the tyrants by Thrafybulus, whom he mentions in his Plutus and other comedies. There have been feveral editions and tranflations of this poet. Nicodemus Frifchin, a Ger¬ man, famous for his claflical knowledge, in the i6til century, tranflated Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, the Equites, and the Acharnenfes, into Latin verfe. Quin¬ tus Septimus Florens rendered into Latin verfe the Wafps, the Peace, and Lyfiftrata ; but his tranflatiou is full of obfolete words and phrafes.

"After he had fpent moft of his patrimony, he entered into the army: but not fucceeding in this profeflion, he went to Delphos to confult the oracle what courfe of life he (hould follow ; when he was advifed to go to Athens, and ftudy philofophy. He accordingly went thither about 18 years of age, and ftudied under Plato till he was 37. By this time he had fpent his whole fortune ; and we are told that he got his living by fell ¬ ing powders, and fume receipts in pharmacy. He fol¬ lowed his ftudies with moft extraordinary diligence, fo that he foon furpaffed all in Plato’s fchool. He eat little, and dept lefs ; and, that he might not over-deep himfelf, Diogenes Laertius tells us, that he lay always with one hand out of the bed, having a ball of brafs in it, which, by its falling into a bafon of the fame me¬ tal, awaked him. We are told, that Ariftotle had fe¬ veral conferences with a learned Jew at Athens, and that by this means he inftru<fted himfelf in the fciences and religion of the Egyptians, and thereby faved A R I [ 65° J A R I Ariftot'e. himfelf the trouble of travelling into Egypt. When ' he had ftudied about 15 years under Plato, he began to form different tenets from thofe of his mailer, who became highly piqued at his behaviour. Upon the death of Plato, he quitted Athens 5 and retired to A- tarnya, a little city of Myfia, where his old friend Her- mias reigned. Here he married Pythias, the filler of this prince, whom he is faid to have loved fo paffionate- ly, that he offered facrifice to her. Some time after, Hermias having been taken prifoner by Meranon the king of Perfia’s general, Ariflotle went to Mitylene the capital of Lefhos, where he remained till Philip king of Macedon, having heard of his great reputation, fent for him to be tutor to his fon Alexander, then a- bout 14 years of age: Ariflotle accepted the offer ; and in eight years taught him rhetoric, natural philofophy, ethics, politics, and a certain fort of philofophy, ac¬ cording to Plutarch, which he taught nobody elfe","Athens, Plato, Plato, Athens, Plato, Plato, Athens","CO,US,EG",2,"Colombia,United States,Egypt","South America,North America,Africa"
"Ariflotle having loft the favour of Alexander by ad¬ hering to Califthenes his kinfman, who was accufed of a confpiracy againft Alexander’s life, he removed to Athens, where he fet up his new fchool. The magi- llrates received him very kindly; and gave him the Ly- cseum, fo famous afterwards for the concourfe of his difciples : here he taught, according to the cuftom long eftablifhed, a public and a fecret do&rine; and as he gave his lectures walking along among his auditors, his fe£t affumed the name of Peripatetic. Here alfo it was, according to fome authors, that he compofed his principal works. Plutarch, however, tells us, that be had already wrote his books of phyfic, morals, meta- phyfics, and rhetoric. The fame author fays, that Ariftotle being piqued at Alexander, becaufe of the prefents he had fent to Xenocrates, was moved with fo much refentment, that he entered into Antipator’s con¬ fpiracy againft this prince. The advocates for Ari¬ ftotle, however, maintain this charge to have been without foundation ; that at leaft it made no impreffion on Alexander, fince about the fame time he ordered him to apply himfelf to the ftudy of animals; and fent him, in order to defray his expences, eight hundred ta* lents, which amounts to four hundred and eighty thoufand crowns, befides a great number of fiftiers and huntfmen to bring him all forts of animals. — When Ariftotle was accufed of impiety by one Eurymedon, a prieft of Ceres, he wrote a large apology for himfelf, addreffed to the magiftrates : but knowing the Athe¬ nians to be extremely jealous in regard to their reli¬ gion, and remembering the fate of Socrates, he was fo much alarmed, that he retired to Chalets, a city of Eubcea, where he ended his days. Some fay he poi- foned himfelf, to avoid falling into the hands of his e- nemies ; others affirm, that he threw himfelf into the Euripus, becaufe he could not comprehend the reafon of its ebbing and flowing ; and there are fome who tell us he died of a colic, in the 63d year of his age, being the third of the 114th Olympiad, two years after Alex¬ ander.

There were many who followed the doctrine of Ariftotle in the reigns of the twelve Cae- fars, and their numbers increafed much under Adrian and Antoninus : Alexander Aphrodinus was the firft profeffor of the Peripatetic philofophy at Rome, being appointed by the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lu¬ cius Verus; and infucceeding ages the dodtrine of A- riftotle prevailed among almoft all men of letters, and many commentaries were written upon his works","Adrian, Rome",US,2,United States,North America

That this, however, was very early introduced into the world, even before the flood, we may gather from the following expreffion in Enoch’s prophecy, as mentioned by the Apoftle Jude : “ Be¬ hold, the Lord cometh with ten thoufands of his faints.” This ffiews, that even at that time men had ideas of traduced him ever after.

As learning advanced in Europe, fo did the knowledge of numbers; and the writers on arithmetic foon: became innumerable. A- bout the year 1464, Regiomentanus, in his triangu¬ lar tables, divided the Radius into 10,000 parts inftead of 60,000 ; and thus tacitly expelled the fexagefimal arithmetic.

The greateft improve¬ ment, however, which the art of computation ever re¬ ceived, is the invention of logarithms. The honour of this invention is unqueftionably due to Lord Napier baron of Merchifton in Scotland, about the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century.

Liberty, indeed, and many other ad¬ vantages, were procured to them by the union of the two kingdoms ; but the falutary effedts were long fuf- pended by mutual enmity, fuch as commonly fublifts between neighbouring nations. Enmity wore out gra¬ dually, and the eyes of the Scots were opened to the advantages of their prefent condition ; the national fpi¬ rit was roufed to emulate and to excel; talents were exerted, hitherto latent; and Scotland at prefent makes a figure in arts and fciences, above what it ever made while an independent kingdom",Liberty,US,2,United States,North America
"As the progrefs of arts and fciences toward perfec¬ tion is greatly promoted by emulation, nothing is more fatal to an art or fcience than to remove that fpur, as where fome extraordinary genius appears who foars above rivalftiip. Mathematics feem to be declining in Britain : the great Newton, having furpaffed all the ancients, has not left to the moderns even the fainteft hope of equalling him ; and what man will enter the lifts who defpairs of victory ? In a country thinly peopled, where even neceifary arts want hands, it is common to fee one perfon ex- ercifing more arts than one: in feveral parts of Scot¬ land, one man ferves as a phyfician, furgeon, and apo¬ thecary; In every populous country, even fimple arts are fplit into parts, and each part has an artift appro¬ priated to it. In the large towns of ancient Egypt, a phyfician was confined to a fingle difeal'e. In me¬ chanic arts that method is excellent. As a hand con¬ fined to a fingle operation becomes both expert and ex¬ peditious, a mechanic art is perfected by having its dif¬ ferent operations diftributed among the greateft num¬ ber of hands: many hands are employed in making a watch ; and a ftill greater number in manufacturing a web of woollen cloth. Various arts or operations car¬ ried on by the fame man, envigorate his mind, becaufe they exercife different faculties; and as he cannot be io ] ART equally expert in every art or operation, he is fre- Arts, quently reduced to fupply want of /kill by. thought ' and invention. Conftant application, on the contrary, to a fingle operation, confines the mind to a fingle objeCt, and excludes all thought and invention : in fuch a train, of life, the operator becomes dull and ftu- pid, like a bead of burden. The difference is vi- iible in the manners of the people : in a country, where, from want of hands, feveral occupations mult be carried on by the fame perfon, the people are know¬ ing and converfable : in a populous country, where ma¬ nufactures flourilli, they are ignorant and unfociable",Newton,"EG,US",2,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"It is vifible in Indoftan, where the people are divided into cafts, which never mix even by marriage, and where every man follows his father’s trade. The Dutch lint-boors are a fimilar inftance : the fame families carry on the trade from generation to generation; and are accordingly ignorant and brutifh even beyond other Dutch peafants. The inhabitants of Buckhaven, a fea-port in the county of Fife, were originally a co¬ lony of foreigners, invited hither to teach our people the art of filhing. They continue fifhers to this day, marry among themfelves, have little intercourfe with their neighbours, and are dull and ftupid to a proverb. 3 Ufeful arts paved the way to fine arts. Men upon Progrefs of whom the former had bellowed every convenience, ar/f' turned their thoughts to the latter. Beauty was ftu- died in objeCls of fight; and men of tafte attached themfelves to the fine arts, which multiplied their en¬ joyments and improved their benevolence. Sculpture and painting made an early figure in Greece ; which afforded plenty of beautiful originals to be copied in tbefe imitative arts. Statuary, a more fimple imita¬ tion than painting, was fooner brought to perfection: the llatue of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno by Po- lycletes, though the admiration of all the world, were executed long before the art of light and lhade was known. Apollodorus, and Zeuxis his difciple, who flourilhed in the 15th Olympiad, were the firft who figured in that art. Another caufe concurred to ad¬ vance ftatuary before painting in Greece, viz. a great demand for ftatues of their gods. Architecture, as a fine art, made a flower progrefs. Proportions, upon which its elegance chiefly depends, cannot be accu¬ rately afeertained, but by an infinity of trials in great buildings : a model cannot be relied on ; for a Targe and a fmall building, even of the fame form, require different proportions","Buckhaven, Jupiter","GR,GB,US,NL",2,"Greece,United Kingdom,United States,Netherlands","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"

"One would imagine, however, that thefe compoli- tions were too Ample to enchant for ever ; as variety in aftion, fentiment, and paflion, is requifite, without which the ftage will not continue long a favourite en¬ tertainment: and yet we find not a fingle improve¬ ment attempted after the days of Sophocles and Euri¬ pides. The manner of performance, indeed, prevented abfolutely any improvement. A fluftuation of paflion and refined fentiments would have made no figure on the Grecian ftage. Imagine the difcording fcene be¬ tween Brutus and Caflius in Julius Caefar to be there exhibited, or the handkerchief in the Moor of Venice : how flight would be their effedl, when pronounced in a mafic, and through a pipe ? The workings of nature upon the countenance, and the fledlions of voice ex- preflive of various feelings, fo deeply affefting in mo¬ dern reprefentation, would have been entirely loft. If a great genius had arifen with talents for compofing a pathetic tragedy in perfeftion, he would have made no figure in Greece. An edifice muft have been eredled of a moderate fize : new aftors muft have been trained to a£l with a bare face, and to pronounce in their own voice. And after all there remained a greater miracle ftill to be performed, viz. a total reformation of tafte in the people of Athens.

"We may judge of this from Plautus, whofe compofi¬ tions are abundantly rude, though much admired by his ART [ 7H ] ART liis cotemporaries, being the Bed that exifted at that time. The exalted fpirit of the Romans hurried them on to the grand and beautiful; and literary produc¬ tions of all kinds were in perfeftion when Auguftus reigned. In attempting ftill greater perfe&ion, the Roman compofitions became a ftrange jumble of incon- fsftent parts : they were tumid and pompous ; and, at the fame time, full of antithefes, conceit, and tinfel wit. Every thing new in the fine arts pleafes, though lefs perfect than what we are accuftomed to ; and, for that reafon, fuch compofitions were generally relilh- ed. We fee not by what gradual Heps writers, af¬ ter the time of Auguftus, deviated from the patterns that were before them ; for no book of any moment after that time is preferved, till we come down to Se¬ neca, in whofe works nature and fimplicity give place to artificial thought and baftard wit. He was a great corrupter of the Reman tafte; and after him nothing was relifhed but brilliant ftrokes of dan- cy, with very little regard to fentiment: even Vir¬ gil and Cicero made no figure in comparifon. Lucan has a forced elevation of thought and ftyle, very diffi¬ cult to be fupported ; and, accordingly, he finks often into puerile refle&ions; witnefs his encomium on the river Po, which, fays he, Would equal the Danube, had it the fame number of tributary ftreams. Quinti¬ lian, a writer of true and claffical tafte, who was pro¬ tected and encouraged by Vefpafian, attempted to ftem the tide of falfe writing. His rhetoric is compofed in an elegant ftyle; and his obfervations contain every de¬ licacy of the critical art. At the fame time flourifhed Tacitus, pofieffing a more extenfive knowledge of the nature of man than any other author, ancient or mo¬ dern, if Shakefpeare be not excepted. His ftyle is ori¬ ginal, concife, compact, and comprehenfive ; and, in what is properly called his hijiory, perfectly correft and beautiful. He has been imitated by feveral, but never equalled by any. Brutus is faid to be the laft of the Romans for love of liberty : Quintilian and Tacitus may be faid to be the laft of the Romans for literary genius. Pliny the Younger is no exception: his ftyle is affedled, turgid, and full of childifh brilliancy. Se¬ neca and Pliny are proper examples of writers who ftu- dy fhow more than fnbftance, and who make fenfe yield to found. The difference between thefe authors and thofe of the Auguftan age, refembles the difference be¬ tween Greek and Italian mufic. Mufic, among the Greeks, limited itfelf to the employment to which it is deftined by nature, viz. to be the handmaid of fenfe, to inforce, enliven, or fweeten a fentiment. In the Ita¬ lian opera, the miftrefs is degraded to be handmaid; a,nd harmony triumphs, with very little regard to fen¬ timent","Roman, Cicero, Lucan","RO,US,IE,GR,IT",2,"Romania,United States,Ireland,Greece,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Another great caufethat precipitates the downfal of every fine art is defpotifra. The reafon is obvious; and there is a difrtial example of it in Rome, particularly with regard to eloquence. We learn from a dialogue accounting for the corruption of the Roman eloquence, that in the decline of the art it became fafhionable to fluff harangues with impertinent poetical quotations, without any view but ornament merely ; and this alfo was long fafhionabR in France.

The feieneexjf law is the only exception, as it flourifhed even in the worft of times : the Roman lawyers were a re- fpedlable body, and lefs the object of jeaioufy than men of power and extenfive landed property. Among the Greeks alfo, a conquered people, the fine arts decayed ; but not fo rapidly as at Rome; the Greeks, farther removed from the feat of government, being lefs within the reach of a Roman tyrant. During their depreifion, they were guilty of the moft puerile conceits : witnefs verfes compofed in the form of an ax, an egg, wings, and fuch like.

"There is ftill another caufe that never fails to under¬ mine a fine art in a country where it is brought to perfe&ion, abftra&ing from every one of the caufes above mentioned. It is remarked a little above, that nothing is more fatal to an art or to a fcience than a performance fo much fuperior to all of the kind as to extinguifh emulation. This remark is exemplified in the great Newton, who, having furpaffed all the an¬ cients, has not left to his countrymen even the fainteft hope of rivalling him ; and to that caufe is attributed the vifible decline of mathematics in Great Britain",Newton,US,2,United States,North America
"The fame caufe would have been fatal to the arts of ftatuary and painting among the Greeks, even though they had continued a free people. The decay of paint¬ ing in modern Italy is, probably, owing to the fame caufe: Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, &c. are lofty oaks that bear down young plants in their neigh¬ bourhood, and intercept from them the funfhine, of e- mulation. Had the art of painting made a flower pro- grefs in Italy, it might have there continued in vigour to this day-.
