"ABARIS, the Hyperborean; a celebrated fage of antiquity, whdfehiftory and travels have been the fubject of much learned difeufiion. Such a number of fabulous * Jamblicb. ftorjeS* were told of him, that Herodotus himfelf feems ^f Lab if t0 fcruple to relate them. Fie tells us only -j-, that this cap. 36. Barbarian was faid to have travelled with an arrow, and took no fuftenance : but this does not acquaint us with the marvellous properties which were attributed to that arrow; nor that it had been given him by the Hyperborean Apollo. With regard to the occafion of } Under the his leaving his native country, Harpocration J tells us, word ’Afa- that the whole earth being infefted with a deadly f” plague, Apollo, upon being confulted, gave no other ] ABA anfwer, than that the Athenians ftiould offer up prayers in behalf oi all other nations: upon which, feveral countries deputed ambaffadors to Athens, among whom was Abaris the Hyperborean. In this journey, he renewed the alliance between his country¬ men and the inhabitants of the ifland of Delos. It appears that he alfo went to Lacedaemon; fince, ac¬ cording to fome writers ||, he there built a temple con- fecrated to Proferpine the Salutary. It is aflerted, that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes, • driving away plagues, laying ftorms J, &c. He wrote feveral books, as Suidasf informs us, viz. Apollo’s arrival into the country of the Hyperboreans ; The nuptials of the river Hebrus; ©ioyov.a, or the Generation of the Gods; A colleftion of oracles; &c. Himerius * the fophift applauds him for'fpeaking pure Greek; which at¬ tainment will be no matter of wonder to fuch as con- fider the ancient intercourfe there was between the Greeks and Hyperboreans.—If the Hebrides, or Weftern Iflands of Scotland, (fays Mr Tolandf), were the Hyperboreans of Diodorus J, then the celebrated Abaris was of that country; and Ukewife a druid, having been the prieft of Apollo. Suidas, who knew not the diftin&ion of the infular Hyperboreans, makes him a Scythian; as do fome others, mifled by the fame vulgar error; though Diodorus has truly fixed his country in an ifland, and not on the continent. And indeed the fi&ions and miftakes concerning our Abaris are infinite: however, it is by all agreed that he travelled quite over Greece, and from thence into Italy, where he convetfed familiarly with Pythagoras, who favour¬ ed him beyond all his -difciples, by inftrufting him in his dodtrines (efpecially his thoughts of nature) in a plainer and more compendious method than he did any other. This diftindtion could not but be very advan¬ tageous to Abaris. The Hyperborean, in return, prefented the Samian, as though he equalled Apollo himfelf in wifdom, with the facred arrow, on which the Greeks have fabuloufly related * that he fat aftride, and flew upon it, through the air, over rivers and lakes, forefts and mountains; in like manner as our vulgar ftill believe, particularly thofe of the Hebrides, that wizards and witches fly whitherfoe ver they pleafe on their broom- fticks. The orator Himerius above mentioned, tho’ one of thofe who, from the equivocal fenfe of the word Hyperborean, feem tohave miftaken Abaris for a Scy¬ thian, yet deferibes his perfon accurately, and gives him a very noble charadter. “ They relate (fays he) “ that Abaris the fage was by nation an Hyperbo- “ rean, appeared a Grecian in fpeech, and refembled “ a Scythian in his habit and appearance. He came “ to Athens, holding a bow in his hand, having a “ quiver hanging on his ftioulders, his body wrapt up “ in a plad, girt about the loins with a gilded belt, “ and wearing trowzers reaching from his wafte down- “ ward.” By this it is evident (continues Mr To- land) that he was not habited like a Scythian, who were always covered with Ikins; but appeared in the native garb of an Aboriginal Scot. As to what re¬ lates to his abilities, Himerius informs us, that “he was affable and pleafant in converfation, in difpatch- 1 lnS great affairs fecret and induftrious, quick-fighted 1 in prefent exigencies, in preventing future dangers cir- ! cumfpedt, a fearcher after wifdom, defirous of friend- ‘ fhip, trufting indeed little to fortune, andhaving every “ thing Abaris the Hyper¬ borean","Athens, Athens","GR,US,IT",2,"Greece,United States,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe"

"ABBOT (George), archbifhop of Canterbury, was born October 29.-1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He went through his ftudies at Oxford, and in 1597 was chpfen principal of Univerfity College. In'!599, he was inftalled dean of Winchefter : the year following, he was chofen vice-chancellor of the univerfity of Ox¬ ford, and a fecond time in 1603'. In 1604, that tranf- lation of the bible now in ufe was begun by the direc¬ tion of king James; and Dr Abbot was the fecond of eight divines of Oxford, to whom the care of tranfla- ting the whole New Teftament (excepting the epiftles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In 1608., he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar, to affift in efta- blifiiing ap union betwixt the kirk of Scotland and the * Beylin’s church of England; and in this affair he behaved* with hift. of Pref- j-jych addrefs and moderation, that it laid the founda- p^:anS' tion of all his future preferment. For king James ever after paid great deference to his advice and counfel; and upon the death of Dr Overton bifliop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his fucceffor, who was accordingly confecrated bilhop of thofe two united fees in December 1609. About a month afterwards he was tranflated to the fee of London, and on the fe¬ cond of November thereafter was raifed to the archie- pifcopal fee. His great zeal for the Proteftant religion made him a ftrenuous promoter of the match between the Eledtor Palatine and the princefs Elizabeth; which was accordingly concluded and folemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbifhop performing the cere¬ mony on a ftage erected in the royal chapel. In the following year happened the famous cafe of divorce be¬ twixt the iadyFrancis Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Effex : an affair which has been by many confidered as one of the greateft blemifhes of king James’s reign; but the part atted therein by the archbifhop added much to the reputation he had al¬ ready acquired for incorruptible integrity. The matter was by the king referred to a court of delegates. The archbifhop fawplainly, that his Majefly was very defirous tjie lady flioqld be divorced^ but. he -was, in his own judgment, dire£tly againfl the divorce. He labour¬ ed all he could to extricate himfelf from this difficulty, by having an end put to the caufe by fome other way than by fentence : but it was to no purpofe; for thofe who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be reftrained from bringing it to the conclufion the king defired. The archbifhop prepared a fpeech, which he intended to have fpoken againft the nullity of the mar¬ riage, in the court at Lambeth ; but he did not make ufe of it, becaufe the king ordered the opinions to be given in few words. He continued, however, in¬ flexible in his opinion againfl: the divorce ; and drew up his reafons, which the king thought fit to anfwer himfelf. It need fcarce be added, that fentence was gi¬ ven in the lady’s favour.—In 1618, the king publifh- ed a declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting fports and paftimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneafmefs to the archbifhop; Archbifhop who, happening to be at Croydon when it came thither,  had the courage to forbid its being read.—Being now in a declining flate of health, the archbifhop ufed in the fummer to go to Hampfhire for the fake of re¬ creation ; and being invited by lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greateft misfortune that ever befell him; for he accidentally kill¬ ed the game-keeper, by an arrow from a crofs-bow which he fhot at one of the deer.

"ACER, the maple-tree ; a genus of plants, of the monoecia order, belonging to the polygamia clafs. Of this genus there are ten Species. 1. The pfeudo platanus, improperly called the fycamore, is a very large and beautiful tree, with broad leaves divided into five lobes, ferrated in their edges; of a dark-green colour on the upper fide, but paler and fomewhat hoary underneath ; the flowers are very fmall, and of a greenifh white colour. The fruit is large, and beautifully variegated with green and purple. This fpecies is a native of Germany ; but thrives very well in Britain, where it is frequent in plantations. Itisveryproperformakingplantationsnear the fea, or fheltering fuch as are already too near it, be- caufe the fycamore-tree pefifts the fpray of the ocean much better than moft other trees. It has however this inconvenience, that its leaves are devoured by in- ftdis, fo as to become full of holes and very unfightly, which has caufed the planting of it to be much neglec¬ ted of late,' 2. The campeftre, or common maple, is too well known to need any particular account; it grow¬ ing very frequently, in hedge-rows, in moft parts of Britain. The timber of the common mapple is far fuperior to beech for all ufes of the turner; particularly for difhes, cups, trenchers, <&c. When it abounds with knots, as it frequently does, it is highly efteemed by joiners for inlaj ings. It i& alfo often employed in ma¬ king mufical inftruments, on account of its lightnefs; and for the whitenefs of its wood was formerly efteem¬ ed for making tables, &c. 3. The negundo, or Vir¬ ginian alh-leaved maple, is a very ftrong ftiooting tree; and in Virginia, where it is a native, is one of the largeft trees of this kind. It muft be planted in places not too much expofed to violent winds, being fubjeft to fplit thereby. 4.

"Thefe have an acrid milky juice, which prevents them from being preyed upon by JnfeCts as the fycamore is ; and as this fpecies refifts the fpray of the fea equally with the firft, it is preferred in plantations fituated near the fea. 5. The rubrum, or Virginian fcarlet flower¬ ing maple, is a native of that country, and never grows to a large fize in Britain. It is, however, cultivated in gardens for the beauty of its flowers, which appear in the beginning of April, in roundilh bunches, at the bottom of the footftalks of the. leaves. The feeds are ripe in five or fix weeks after; and ought to.be imme¬ diately fown, being otherwife very apt to. perilh. The tree ought to be flickered, efpecially whilft young, from the north-eaft winds; it delights in a moift light foil, where it will thrive much better, as well as produce many more flowers and much better feeds, than in a dry round. A variety of this tree is known in England y the name of Sir Charles Wager's Flowering Maple, from its being firft fent from America to Sir Charles Wager. The flowers of this kind come out in larger clufters than the other, and furround the fmall branches, fo that the tree appears entirely covered with them, and makes a much more beautiful appearance than the for¬ mer, Acer, the Maple-tree ACE [ 47 ] ACE Acer, mer, which now is not fo much efteemed. 6. The fac- - lhe charinum, or American fugar-maple, fo called from a M-ipie-tree. coarfe 0f fUgar being obtained from its juice by * See Sugar. the inhabitants of North America *, grows to a large fize. When young, it very much refembles the Nor¬ way maple: but as it grows up, the leaves become more deeply divided, and their furfaces lefs fmooth ; they are, befides, preyed upon by infers, like the fyca- . more ; by which circumftances the two fpecies are eafi- ly diftin'guifhed. 7. The Penfylvanicum, or Ameri¬ can mountain-maple, very much refembles the fugar- maple, only its leaves are more pointed. 8. The opa- lus, or Italian maple, is very common in moft parts of Italy, particularly about Rome; but in Britain is very rarely to be met with, though hardy enough to bear the open air. It is one of the larged fpecies of trees in Italy, and affords a great fhade by its nume¬ rous and large leaves. On this account it is planted on the road-fides, and near habitations. 9. The monfpe- fulanum, or Montpelier maple, is common in the fouth of France, and in Italy ; but is hardly met with in Britain. The leaves refemble thofe of the common maple ; but are of a much thicker fubftance, a fhining green colour, and not fo large. They continue in ver¬ dure very late in the autumn, which renders the trees more valuable. 10.

"_ Culture. Moll fpecies of forrel may be propagated either by feeds, fown early in the fpring on a moift ffiady border; or by parting the roots, either in fpring or autumn. The plants raifed from the feeds, however, Acetofa are more vigorous than thofe propagated from cut- Acj,"",ans tings. They ought to be placed at a gobd diftance  :~ from one another, fo as to allow of digging the ground about each plant. French forrel, particularly, ipreads its roots fo much, that the plants ought not to be pla¬ ced at lefs than two feet diftance from one another. It agrees better with an open fituation than fuch as are natives of Britain. As the feed neither of French for¬ rel nor of the forrel-tree ripens well in England, they can only be propagated from cuttings. The French forrel thrives beft on ftony land, as it grows naturally on rocks. The forrel-tree requires to be houfed in winter, being unable to live in hard froft. If the cut¬ tings are planted in a fhady border any time in fum- mer, and duly fupplied with water, they will foon put out roots : upon which they muft be immediately ta¬ ken up, and planted in pots ; for if permitted to re¬ main in the border, they will foon grow fo vigorous as to render their tranfplanting hazardous. When planted in pots, they ftiould be placed in the ffiade, until they are again rooted; then they may enjoy the open air till Oftober, when the frofts begin to be ffiarp; at which time, they ftiould be carried into the green-houfe, and treated in the fame way as myrtles or other har¬ dy green-houfe plants",,FR,2,France,Europe

"ACUNA (Chriftophero de), a Spanifli Jefuit, born at Burgos. He was admitted into the fociety in 1612, being then but 15 years of age. After having devoted fame years to ftudy, he went to America, where he af- fifted in making converts in Chili and Peru. In 1640, he returned to Spain, and gave the king an account how far he had fucceeded in the commiffion he had re¬ ceived to make difeoveries on the river of the Amazons; and the year following he publiftied a defeription of this river, at Madrid. Acuna was fent to Rome, as procurator of his province. He returned to Spain with the title of Qualificator of the Inquifition; but foon after embarked again for the Weft Indies, and was at Lima in 1675, when father Southwell publiftied at Rome the Bibliotheque of the Jefuit writers. Acuna’s work is intitled, Nuevo defeubriwento del gran rio de las Nma- zonas; i. e. “ A new difeovery of the great river of the Amazons.” He wtis ten months together upon this river, having had inftruftions to inquire into every thing with the greateft exaftnefs, that his majefty might thereby be enabled to render the navigation more eafy and commodious. He went aboard a (hip at Quito with Peter Texeira, who had already been fo far up the river, and was therefore thought a proper perfon to ac¬ company him in this expedition. They embarked in February 1639, but did not arrive at Para till the De¬ cember following. It is thought that the revolutions of Portugal, by which the Spaniards loft all Brafil, and the colony of Para at the mouth of the river of the A - mazons, were the catife that the relation of this Jefuit was fuppreffed ; for as it could not be of any advantage to the Spaniards, they were afraid it might prove of great fervice to the Portugefe., The copies of this work became extremely fcarce, fo that the publifhers of the French tranflation at Paris aflerted, that there was not one copy of the original extant, excepting one in","Burgos, Madrid, Rome, Lima, Rome, Quito, Paris","US,ES,PE,PT,PH,EC,FR",2,"United States,Spain,Peru,Portugal,Philippines,Ecuador,France","North America,Europe,South America,Europe,Asia,South America,Europe"

But an unexpedled incident at once raifed him, and gave him an opportunity of exerting his fine talents to advan¬ tage : for in the year 1704, the lord-treafurer Godol- phin happened to complain to lord Halifax, that the duke of Marlborough’s vi&ory at Blenheim had not been celebrated in verfe in the manner it deferved ; and intimated, that he would take it kindly, if his lordffiip, who was the known patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of doing juftice to fo elevated a fubjedl.

"Lord Halifax thereupon named Mr Addifon; infilling, however, that the treafurer himfelf ffiould fend to him; which he promifed. Accordingly he prevailed on Mr Boyle (afterwards lord Carlton) then chancellor of the exchequer, to make the propofal to Mr Addifon; which he did in fo polite a manner, that our author readily undertook the talk.

Whilft he was in this kingdom, the Tatler was firft publilhed ; and he difcovered his friend Sir Richard Steele to be the author, by an obfervation ' on Virgil, which he had communicated to him. He afterwards aflifted confiderably in carrying on this pa¬ per, which the author acknowledges.

It was re- . ceived with the moft uncommon applaufe, having run thirty-five nights without interruption ; and all parties, however divided, agreed in giving this play the com¬ mendation it deferred. It was no lefs efteemed abroad, having been tranflated into French, Italian, and Ger¬ man ; and it was afted at Leghorn, and feveral other places, with vaft applaufe. The Jefuits at St Omers made a Latin verfion of it, and the ftudents afted it with great magnificence. Her majefty queen Anne fignified an inclination of having the play dedicated to her ; but the author having propofed to dedicate it elfewhere, to avoid giving offence, publifhed it with¬ out a dedication. He had formed a defign of writing another tragedy upon the death of Socrates; but this he never carried into execution. He intended alfo to have compofed an Englilh dictionary upon the plan of the Italian (Della Crufca) ; but, upon the death of the queen, being appointed fecretary to the lords juftices, he had not leifure to carry on fuch a work./ When the earl of Sunderland was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, Mr Addifon was again made fecretary for the • affairs of that kingdom; and, updh the earl’s being removed from the lieutenancy, he was chofen one of the lords of trade.

The word is compounded of ad, to; and os, oris, mouth ; and literally fignifies, to apply the hand to the mouth ; Manum ad os admovere, q. d. to kifs the hand; this being, in the.eaftern countries, one of the great marks of refpeft and fubmiflion.—The Ro¬ mans praftifed adoration at facrifices, and other fo- 1 enmities ^ in palling by temples, altars, groves, &c.; at the fight of ftatues, images, or the like, whether of ftone or wood, wherein any thing of divinity was fuppofed to refide. ■ Ufually there were images of the gods placed at the gates of cities, for thofe who went in or out, to pay their refpefts to.—The ceremony of adoration among the ancient Romans was thus: The devotee having his head covered, applied his right hand to his lips, the fore-finger re fling on his thumb, which was ereft, and thus bowing his head, turned himfelf round from left to right. The kifs thus given was called ofculum labraturn ; for ordinarily they were afraid to touch the images of their gods themfelves with their profane lips. Sometimes, however, they would kifs their feet, or even knees, it being held an incivility to touch their mouths ; fo that the affair pafled at fome diftance. Saturn, however, and Hercules, were adored with the head bare; whence the worfhip of the lalt was called injiitutum peregrinum, and ritus Groecatri- cus, as departing from the cuftomary Roman method, which was to facrifice and adore with the face veiled, and the cloths drawn up to the ears, to prevent any interruption in the ceremony by the fight of unlucky objefts.—The Jewifh manner of adoration was by proftration, bowing, and kneeling.—The Chriftians adopted the Grecian rather than the Roman method, and adored always uncovered. The ordinary pofture of the ancient Chriftians was kneeling, but on Sundays ftanding : and they had a peculiar regard to the Eaft, to which point they ordinarily direfted their prayers","Hercules, Roman, Roman","RO,US",2,"Romania,United States","Europe,North America"

"He was the perfon chofen by the army of Lower Moelia, to carry the news of Nerva’s death to Trajan, fuccef- for to the empire. He accompanied Trajan in moft of his expeditions, and particularly diftinguilhed himfelf in the fecond war againft the Daci; and having before been quasftor, as well as tribune of the people, he was now fucceffively pi-aetor, governor of Pannonia, and conful. After the fiege of Atra in Arabia was raifed, Trajan, who had already given him the government of Syria, left him the command of the army: and at length, when he found death approaching, it is faid he adopted him. Adrian, who was then in Antiochia, as foon as he received the news thereof, and of Tra¬ jan’s death, declared himfelf emperor, on the 11th of Auguft, 117. No fooner had he arrrived at the im¬ perial dignity, than he made peace with the Perfians, to whom he yielded up great part of the conquefts of his predecelfors ; and from generofity, or policy, he remitted the debts of the Roman people, which, ac¬ cording to the calculation of thofe who have reduced them to modern money, amounted to 22,500,000 gol¬ den crowns ; and he burnt all the bonds and obliga¬ tions relating to thofe debts, that the people might be under no apprehenfion of being called to an account for them afterwards. There are medals in commemo¬ ration of this fact, in which he is reprefented holding a flambeau in his hand, to fet fire to all thofe bonds which he had made void. He went to vifit all the pro¬ vinces; and did not return to Rome till the year 1x8, when the fenate decreed him a triumph, and honoured him with the title of Father of his country; but he refufed both, and defired that Trajan’s image might triumph. No prince travelled more than Adrian; there being hardly one province in the empire which he did not vifit. In 120 he went into Gaul; from thence he went over to Britain, in order to fubdue the Caledonians, who were making continual in¬ roads into the provinces.

"quell by the defcription fome old foldiers he found there, who had ferved under Agricola, gave him of the country. In hopes, therefore, of keeping them quiet by enlarging their bounds, he delivered up to the Caledonians all the lands lying between the two Friths and the Tyne ; and at the fame time, to fecure the Roman province from their future incurfions, built the famous wall which Hill bears his name (a). Having thus fettled matters in Britain, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Reftorer of Britain, as appears by fome medals. He foon after went into Spain, to Mauritania, and at length into the Fall, where he quieted the commotions raifed by the Parthians. After having vifited all the provinces of Afia, he returned to Athens in 125, where he palled the winter, and was initiated in the mylleries of Eleu- finian Ceres. He went from thence to Sicily, chiefly to view mount Aitna, contemplate its phenomena, and en¬ joy the beautiful and extenfive profpeft afforded from its top. He returned to Rome the beginning of the year 129 ; and, according to fome, he went again, the fame year, to Africa; and, after his return from thence, to the call. He was in Egypt in the year 132, revifited Syria the year following, returned to Athens in 134, and to Rome in 135.

He conquered the Jews; and, by way of infult, ere&ed a temple to Jupiter on Calvary, and placed a ftatue of Adonis in the manger of Bethlehem; he caufed alfo the images of fwine to be engraven on the gates of Jerufalem. At laft he was feized with a drop- fy, which vexed him to fuch a degree, that he became almoft raving mad. A great number of phyficians were fent for, and to the multitude of them he aferi- bed his death. He died at Baiae in the 63d year of his age, having reigned 21 years.

"Concerning the products and general appearance of General ap-this vulcano, authors are much better agreed.—The pearance, journey from Catania to its fummit has been lately c‘ deferibed by three travellers, M. D’Orville, Mr Bry- done, and Sir William Hamilton. All thefe agree, that this Angle mountain affords an epitome of the dif¬ ferent climates throughout the whole world : towards the foot, it is very hot; farther up^. more temperate; and grows gradually more and more cold the higher we afeend. At the very top, it is perpetually covered with fnow: from thence the whole ifland is fupplied with that article, fo neceffary in a hot climate, and without which the natives fay Sicily could not be inhabited.

On the north fide of this fnowy region, Mr Brydone was affured, that there are feveral fmall lakes which never thaw; and that the fnow mixed with the afties and falts of the mountain are accumulated to a vaft depth. The quantity of falts contained in this mountain, he, with great probability^ conjeftures to be one reafon of the prefervation of its fnows ; for fait * See CoW,.increafes the coldnefs of fnow to a furprifing degree *","Catania, Hamilton","IT,MT,US",2,"Italy,Malta,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"ed of ftones and afties; and, as Mr Hamilton was in¬ formed by feveral people of Catania, had been thrown up about 25 or 30 years before the time (1769) he vifited mount vEtna. Before this mountain was thrown up, there was only a prodigious large chafm, orgulph, in the middle of the above-mentioned plain ; and it has been remarked, that about once in 100 years the top of vEtna falls in; which undoubtedly muft be the cafe at certain periods, or the mountain behoved conti- nually to increafe in height. As this little mountain, though emitting finoke from every pore, appeared fo¬ lk! and firm, Mr Hamilton and his companions went up to the very top. In the middle is a hollow, about two miles and a half in circumference, according to Mr Hamilton ; three miles and a half, according to Mr Brydone ; and three or four, according to Mr D’Or¬ ville. The infide is crufted over with falts and fulphur of different colours. It goes {helving down, from the top, like an inverted cone ; the depth, in Mr Hamil¬ ton’s opinion, nearly correfponding to the height of the little mountain. From many places of this fpace iffue volumes of fulphureous fmoke, which being much heavier than the circumambient air, inftead of amend¬ ing in it, roll down the fide of the mountain, till, co¬ ming to a more denfe atmofphere, it {hoots off horizon¬ tally, and forms a large traft in the air, according to the direction of the wind; which, happily for our tra¬ vellers, carried it exaftly to the fide oppofite to which they were placed. In the middle of this funnel is the tremenduous and unfathomable gulph, fo much cele¬ brated in all ^ges, both as the terror of this life, and the place of puniftiment in the next. From this gulph continually iffue terrible and confufed noifes, which in eruptions are increafed to fuch a degree as to be heard at a prodigious diftance. Its diameter is probably very different at different times : for Mr Hamilton obfer- ved, by the wind clearing away the fmoke from time to time, that the inverted hollow cone was contracted almoft to a point; while Mr D’Orville and Mr Bry¬ done found the opening very large. Both Mr Bry¬ done and Mr Hamilton found the crater too hot to defeend into it; but Mr D’Orville was bolder : and accordingly he and his fellow-traveller, faftened to ropes which two or three men held at a diftance for fear of accidents, defeended as near as poffible to the brink of the gulph ; but the fmall flames and fmoke which iffued from it on every fide, and a greenifh ful¬ phur and pumice-ftones, quite black, which covered the margin, would not permit them to come fo near as to have a full view. They only faw diftindtly in the middle, a mafs of matter which rofe, in the ihape of a cone, to the height of above 60 feet, and which towards the bafe, as far as their fight could reach, might be 600 or 800. While they were obferving this fub- ftance, fome motion was perceived on the north fide, oppofite to that whereon they flood ; and immediately the mountain began to fend forth fmoke and aihes","Catania, Hamilton","IT,US",2,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

This is immediately fucceeded by the Sylvofa, or woody region; which forms a circle of the moft beautiful green, furrounding the mountain on all fides. This region is variegated with a vaft number of mountains of a conical form, thrown up by Etna, in thofe eruptions which burft out from its fides. Mr Ha¬ milton counted 44 on the Catania fide, each having its crater, many with large trees flourifhing both within and without the crater. All thefe, except a few of late date, have acquired a wonderful degree of fertility. The circumference of this zone, or great circle, according to Recupero, is not lefs than 70 or 80 miles. It is every¬ where fucceeded by the Regione culta; which is much broader than the reft, and extends on all fides to the foot of the mountain. Here terrible devaftations are fometimes committed by the eruptions; and the whole region is likewife full of conical mountains thrown up by them. The circumference of this region, is, by Re¬ cupero, reckoned 183 miles; but we have already gi¬ ven our reafons for rejecting thefe dimenfions.—This region is bounded by the fea to the fouth and fouth- eaft; and on all other fides, by the rivers Semetus and Alcantara, which form the boundaries of mount Etna",Catania,IT,2,Italy,Europe

From Mr D’Orville’s and Mr Brydone’s accounts, we muft reckon this part of the mountain pretty fteep: but Mr Hamilton fays, that the afcent was fo gradual, as not to be in the leaft fatiguing; and had it not been for the fnows, they might have rode on their mules to the very foot of the crater",Vulcan,RO,2,Romania,Europe

"All the abovementioned fymptoms preceded the great Eruptian in eruption of ./Etna in 1669. For feveral months before i669- the lava broke forth, the old mouth, or great crater on the fummit, was obferved to fend forth great quantities of fmoke and flame; the top had fallen in, fo that the mountain was much lowered; the Hands alfo of Volcan and Stromboli, two vulcanoes to the weftward of Sicily, were obferved to rage more than ufual.—Eighteen days before the eruption, the iky was very thick and dark, with thunder, lightning, frequent concufiions of the earth, and dreadful fubterraneous bellowings. On the 1 Ith of March, fome time before the lava got vent, a rent was opened in the mountain twelve miles in length, into which, when ftongs were thrown down, they could not be heard to ftrike the bottom. Burning rocks, 60 palms (15 of our feet) in length, were thrown to the diftance of a mile ; others of a leffer fize were carried three miles off; the internal noifes of the moun¬ tain were exceedingly dreadful, and the thunder and lightning from the fmoke fcarce lefs terrible than they. When the lava at laft got vent, it burft out of a vineyard, 20 miles below the great crater, and fprung up into the air to a confiderable height. Here it form¬ ed a mountain of ftones and afhes, not lefs, as SirWm Hamilton conjeftures, than half a mile perpendicular in height, and three miles in circumference. For 54 days, neither fun nor ftars had appeared; but foon af¬ ter the lava got vent, the mountain became very quiet","March, Hamilton","GB,US",2,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"The terrible effects of this, fiery ftream maybe imagined from its amazing extent; being, as Sir Wm Hamil¬ ton obferves, no lefs than 14 miles long, and in many places fix in breadth. In its courfe, it deftroyed the habitations of near 30,000 perfons; and meeting with a lake four miles in compafs, it not only filled it up, though feveral fathom deep, but made a mountain in the place of it. Having reached Catania, it deftroyed part of its walls, and ran for a confiderable length into the fea, forming a fafe and beautiful harbour; which, however, was foon filled up by a frefh torrent of the fame inflamed matter",Catania,IT,2,Italy,Europe
"“ After having taken breath, as the earth flill trem- “ bled greatly, I thought it moft prudent to leave the “ mountain and return to my villa; where I found my “ family in a great alarm at the continual and violent “ explofions of the vulcano, which fhook our houfe to “ its very foundation, the doors and windows fwing- “ ing upon their hinges..—The noife and fmell of ful- “■ phur increafing, we removed from our villa to Naples: “ and I thought proper, as I puffed by Portici, to “ inform the court of what I had feen ; and humbly “ offered it as my opinion, that his Sicilian Majefly <£ fhould leave the neighbourhood of the threatening “ mountain. 1 obferved, in my way to Naples, “ which was in lefs than two hours after I had left the “ mountain, that the lava had actually covered three “ miles of the very road through which we had re- “ treated.

"*£ Befides thefe explofions, which were very frequent, *e there was a continued fubterraneous and violent “ rumbling noife, which lafted this night about five <£ hours.” No doubt the fame terrible appearances are put on by iEtna at the time its lavas break forth; but in a much greater degree, in proportion to the fuperior fize of the mountain.—The appearance, and indeed the ef- fe£ls, of the lava itfelf, are very dreadful. When it firft iffues, the lava appears very fluid, and runs with the ra¬ pidity of a fwiftriver: but even then it furprifingly re¬ fills the impreflion of folid bodies; for Sir Wm Hamil¬ ton could not pierce that of Vefuvius with a flick dri¬ ven againft it with all his force; nor did the' largefl Hone he was able to throw upon it fink, but made a flight impreffion, and then floated along. This hap¬ pened almofl at the very mouth, when the lava appear¬ ed liquid as water, and when he faw it running with a rapidity equal to the river Severn at the paffage near Briftol.—A defcription of the lava iffuing from mount iEtna in 1669 was fent to the court of England by Lord Winchelfea, who at that time happened to be at Catania in his way home from an embaffy at Conflanti- nople. His account is not now to be procured; but Mr Hamilton found a copy in Sicily, and hath given an extradl, part of which follows. ££ When it was ££ night, I went upon two towers in divers places ; “ and I could plainly fee, at ten miles diftance, as we “ judged, the lire begin to run from the mountain in ££ a direct line, the flame to afcend-as high and as big ££ as one of the greatefl fteeples in your Majefty’s “ kingdoms, and to throw up great Hones into the air; “ I could difcern the river of fire to defcend the mouh- “ tain of a terrible fiery or red colour, and ftones of a “ paler red to fwim thereon, and to be fome as big as “ an ordinary table. We could fee this fire to move “ in feveral other places, and all the country covered “ with fire, afcending with great flames in many pla- “ ces, fmoking like to a violent furnace of iron melted, “ making a noife with the great pieces that fell, efpe- “ dally thofe that fell into the fea. A cavalier of <£ Malta, who lives there, and attended me, told me, that the river was as liquid, where it iffues out of the “ mountain, as water, and came out like -a torrent “ with great violence, and is five or fix fathom deep, “ and as broad, and that no ftones fink therein.” The account given in the Philofophical Tranfadlions is to the fame purpefe. We are there told, that the la¬ va is “ nothing elfe than diverfe kinds of metals and “ minerals, rendered liquid by the fiercenefs of the fire “ in the bowels of the earth, boiling up find gulhing “ forth as the water doth at the head of fome great ri- “ ver; and having run in a full body for a ftone’s-caft “ or more, began to cruft or curdle, becoming, when “ cold, thofe hard porous ftones which the people call “ Sciarri.” Thofe, though cold in comparifon of what firft iffues from the mountain, yet retained fo much heat as to referable huge cakes of fea-coal ftrongly ig¬ nited, and came tumbling over one another, bearing down or burning whatever was^ in their way.—In this manner the lava proceeded flowly on till it came to the fea, when a moft extraordinary conflift enfued betwixt the two adverfe elements.

"AGAPE, in ecclefiaftical hiftory, the love-feaft, or feaftof charity, in ufe among the primitive Chriftians; when a liberal contribution was piade by the rich to feed the poor. The word is Greek, and fignifies love.— St Chryfoftom gives the following account; of this feaft, which he derives from the apoftolical 'practice. He fays, “ the firft Chriftians had all things in common, as we read in the A.6ls of the Apbftles; but when that equality of pofieffions ceafed, as it did even in the A- poftles time, the agape, or love-feaft, was fubftituted in the room of it. Upon certain days, after partaking of the Lord’s fupper, they met at a common feaft; the rich bringing provifions, and the poor who had nothing being invited.” It was always attended with receiving the holyfacrament; but there is fome difference between the ancient and modern interpreters as to the circum- ftance of time, viz. Whether this feaft was held before or after the communion. St Chryfoftom is of the lat¬ ter opinion; the learned Dr Cave of the former.—Thefe love-feafts, during the three firft centuries, were held in the church; but at length fuch abufes were com¬ mitted at them, that the councils of Laodicea and Car¬ thage prohibited the practice for the future",,GR,2,Greece,Europe
"3 ] A. G A —6. The asruginofus or verdigrife mufliroom, is of a mo¬ derate fize, and covered with a mucus of a verdigrife colour. It is only to be found in the garden belong¬ ing to the company of apothecaries at London, and m St James’s park. It has alfo been obferved in a gravel- pit in the middle of September.—7.

It is found in September, in woodlands and paftures. This fpecies is thought to be poifonous ; and we have the following account of the fymptoms produced by eating it, in Dr Percival’s Effays. “ Robert Uftierwood, of Mid¬ dleton, near Manchefter, a ftrong healthy man, aged 70 years, early in the morning gathered and eat what he fuppofed to be a muftiroom.

"In the fummer feafon they may be uncovered to re¬ ceive gentle fhowers of rain at proper times; and in long dry feafons the beds fliould now and then be watered, but much wet ought by no means to be fuf- fered to come to them. During the winter feafon they muft be kept as dry as poffible, and fo clofely covered as to keep out cold. In frofty, or very cold weather, if feme warm litter, fhaken out of a dung-heap, is laid on, the growth of the muftirooms will be promoted : but betwixt this and the bed, a covering of dry litter muft be interpofed ; which ftiould be renewed as it de¬ cays ; and, as the cold increafes, the covering muft be 14 ] A G A thickened. By attending to thefe direftions, plenty Agaricus, of muftirooms may be produced all the year round. Mu(h°rrootT| One bed will continue good for many months. ‘ In the Ephemerides of the Curious we find mention made of a ftone, called by Dr John George Wolcka- merus, who faw one in Italy, Lapis Lyncurius, which ne¬ ver ceafes to produce in a few days muftirooms of an ex¬ cellent flavour by the moll Ample and eafy procefs ima¬ ginable. “ It is (fays he) of the bignefs of an ox’s head, rough and urteven on its furface, and on which alfo are perceived fome clefts and crevices. It is black in fome parts, and in others of a lighter and greyilh colour",,IT,2,Italy,Europe
"Internally it is porous, and nearly of the nature of the pumice-ftone, but much heavier; and it contains a fmall piece of flint, which is fo incorporated with it as to appear to have been formed at the fame time the ftone itfelf received its form. This gives room to judge, that thofe ftones have been produced by a fat and vifeid juice, which has the property of indurating whatever matter it filtrates into. The ftone here fpoken of, when it has been lightly covered with earth, and fprinkled with warm water, produces muftirooms of an exquifite flavour,- which are ufually round, fometimes oval, and whofe borders, by their inflexions and different curvi- ties, reprefent in fome meafure human ears. The prin¬ cipal colour of thefe muftirooms is fometimes yellowilh, and fometimes of a bright purple; but they are always diffeminated with different fpots, of a deep orange co¬ lour, or red brown ; and when thefe fpots are recent, and ftill in full bloom, they produce a very agreeable effeft to the fight. But what appears admirable is, that the part of the ftalk which remains adhering to the ftone, when the mulhroom has been feparated from it, grows gradually hard, and petrifies in time, fo that.it teems that this fungites reftores to the ftone the nutri¬ tive juice it received from k, and that it thus contri¬ butes to its increafe.” John Baptift Porta pretends, that this ftone is found in feveral pa'rts of Italy; and that it is not only to be met with at Naples, taken out of mount Vefuvius; but alfo on mount Pantherico, in the principality of Arellino ; on mount Garganus, in Apu¬ lia; and on the fummit of fome other very high moun- ' tains. He adds, that the muflirooms which grow on tbofe forts of ttones, and are ufually called fungi lyncu- rii, have the property of diffolving and breaking the ftone of the kidneys and bladder; and that, for this purpofe, nothing more is required than to dry them in the ftiade, and being reduced to powder, to make the patient, falling, take a fufficient quantity*of this pow¬ der, in a glafs of white-wine, which will fo cleanfe the excretory dufts of the urine, that no ftones will ever after be collefted in them.

"AGRICOLA (Cneus Junius), born at Frejus in Px-ovence, was made lieutenant in Vefpafian’s time to Vettius Bolanus in Britain; and, upon his return, was ranked by that emperor among the patricians, and made governor of Aquitania. This poft he held three years; and upon his,return was.chofen conful, and after¬ ward appointed governor of Britain, where he greatly diftinguiflxed himfelf. He reformed many abufes oc- cafioned by the avarice or negligence of former gover¬ nors ; put a flop to extortion ; and caufed juftice to be impartially adminiftered. Vefpafian dying about this time, his fon Titus, knowing the great merit of Agricola, continued him in the govrnment. In the fpring, he marched towards the north, where he made fome new conquefts, and ordered forts to be built for the Romans to winter in. He fpent the following win¬ ter in concerting fchemes to bring the Britons to con¬ form to the Roman cuftoms: he thought the bell way of diverting them from rifing and taking arms, was to foften their rough manners, by propofmg to them new kinds of pleafure, and infpiring them with a defire of imitating the Roman manners. Soon after this, the country was adorned with magnificent temples, porticos, baths, and many other fine buildings. The Britifli no¬ bles had at length their fons educated in learning ; and they who before had the utmoft averfion to the Roman language, now began to ftudy it with great afliduity: they wore likewife the Roman habit; and, as Tacitus obferves, they were brought to confider thofe things as marks of politenefs, which were only fo many badges of flavery. Agricola, in his third campaign, advan¬ ced as far as the Tweed; and in his fourth, he fub- dued the nations betwixt the Tweed and the friths of Edinburgh and Dumbritton, into which the rivers Glotta and Bodotria difcharge themfelves ; and here he built fortrefles to fhut up the nations yet unconquered","Roman, Roman, Roman, Roman, Edinburgh","RO,GB",2,"Romania,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"In his fifth, he marched beyond the friths ; where he made fome new acquifitions, and fixed garrifons along the weftern coafts, over againft Ireland. In his fixth campaign he pafled the river Bodotria, ordering his fleet, the firft which the Romans ever had in thofe parts, to row along the coafts, and take a view of the northern parts. In the following fpring, the Britons raifed an army of 30,000 men; and the command was Agricola",,IE,2,Ireland,Europe
"Agricola (George), a German phyfician, famous for his Ikill in metals. He was born at Glaucha, in Mifnia, the 24th of March 1494. The difcoveries which he made in the mountains of Bohemia gave him fo great a defire of examining accurately into e- very thing relating to metals, that though he had en- i gaged in the practice of phyfic at Joachimftal by ad¬ vice of his friends, he ftill profecuted his ftudy of fof- fils with great affiduity ; and at length removed to Chemnitz, where he entirely devoted himfelf to this ftudy. He fpent in purfuit of it the penfion he had of Maurice duke of Saxony, and part of his own eftate; fo that he reaped more reputation than profit from his labours. He wrote feveral pieces upon this and other fubje£ts; and died at Chemnitz the 21st of November, 1555, a very firm Papift. In his younger years he feemed not averfe to the Proteftant doftrine; and he highly difapproved of the fcandalous traffic of indul- gencies, and feveral other things in the church of Rome. The following lines of his were polled up in the ftreets of Zwickaw, in the year 1719 : Si nos injeBo falvabit ciftula nummo, Heu nimium infelix tu mihi, pauper, eris!

"The eftablifhment of tjie Romans in Britain produ¬ ced great improvements in agriculture, infomuch that prodigious quantities of corn were annually exported from the ifland; but when the Roman power began to decline, this, like all the other arts, declined alfo, and was almoft totally deftroyed by the departure of that people. The unhappy Britons were now expofed to frequent incurfions of the Scots and Pifts, who deftroy¬ ed the fruits of their labours, and interrupted them in the exercife of their art. After the arrival of the Sax¬ ons in the year 449, they were involved in fuch long wars, and underwent fo many calamities, that the hus¬ bandmen gradually loft much of their (kill, and were at laft driven from thofe parts of their country which were moft proper for cultivation",Roman,RO,2,Romania,Europe
"The invalion of the Normans, in 1066, contributed very much to the improvement of agriculture ; for, by that event, many thoufands of hulbandmen from Flan¬ ders, France, and Normandy, fettled in Britain, ob¬ tained eftates or farms, and cultivated them after the manner of their country. The implements of hulban- dry, ufed at this time, were of the fame kind with thofe employed at prefent; but fome of them were lefs per- feCl in their conftruftion. The plough, for example, had but one ftilt, or handle, which the ploughman uided with one hand, having in his other hand an in- rument which ferved both for cleaning and mending the plough, as well as for breaking the clods. The Norman plough had two wheels ; and in the light foil of Normandy was commonly drawn by one or two oxen; but, in England, a greater number was often neceflary. In Wales, the perfon who conduCled the oxen in the plough walked backwards. Their carts, harrows, fcythes, fickles, and flails, from the figures of them ftill remaining, appear fo have been nearly of the fame conftruClion with thofe that are now ufed. In Wales, they did not ufe a fickle for reaping their corns, butaninftrumentlikethe blade of a knife, with a wooden handle at each end.—Their chief manure, next to dung, feems ftill to have been marie. Summer fallowing of lands defigned for wheat, and ploughing them feveral times, appear to have been frequent praftices of the Englilh farmers in this period",Norman,"FR,US",2,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The moft eonfiderable improvements in agriculture, however, have taken place in Britain fince the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The reformation was no lefs favour- ' able to the arts than to religion. Improvements were firft begun by fome natives of Switzerland who fettled in England ; and the liberal fpirit of inquiry fucceed- ing this remarkable period, hath in a manner entirely put an end to that flavilh attachment to the cuftoms of preceding ages, which, under the dominion of popery, proved an unfurmountable bar to the progrefs of every fcience. Societies for the improvement of this moft ufeful art have been inftituted both in England and Scotland; and though the agriculture of Scotland hath hitherto fcarcely equalled that of England,yet the im¬ provements that are daily making in the former, and the univerfal increafe of the knowledge of the art among her inhabitants, leave no room to doubt, that in a few years fhe will Ihow every mark of equality that foil, cli¬ mate, and other natural differences, will allow",,CH,2,Switzerland,Europe

"What gave occafion to the recommendation of this 48 plant, was, that, about the year 1760, Mr Wych, chair- Recom- man of the Committee of Agriculture of the London sir'jarnes^^ Society, for the encouragement of arts, manufaftures, Caldwell, and commerce, came to Rocque (who was become very eminent by the premiums he had received from the fo- ciety), and told him, he had been thinking, that as there are many animals which fubfift wholly upon the fruits of the earth, there muft certainly be fome plant or herb fit for them, that naturally vegetates in winter; otherwife we muft believe the Creator, infinitely wife and good, to have made creatures without providing for their fubfiftence ; and that if there had been no fuch plants or herbs, many fpecies of animals would have perilhed before we took them out of the hands of nature, and provided for them dry meat at a feafon, when, indigenous plantshavingbeenindifcriminately ex¬ cluded, under the name of weeds, from cultivated fields and places fet apart for natural grafs, green or frefh meat was no longer to be found","London, Caldwell","GB,US",2,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

His an- fwers to thefe letters were the fame that had been given by Rocque.

"Mr Wych then applied again to Rocque; and defi- red him to fearch for the plant fo much defired, and fo certainly exifting. Rocque fet about this fearch with great afliduity, and finding that a pimpernel, called burnet, was of very fpeedy growth, and grew near as faft in winter as in fummer, he took a handful of it and carried it into his {table, where there were five hor¬ fes, every one of which eat of it with the greateft eager- nefs; fnatching it even without firft fmelling it. Upon the fuccefs of this experiment he went to London, and bought all the burnet-feed he could get, amounting to no more than eight pounds, it having been only ufed in fallads; and he paid for it at the rate of 4/. a pound",London,GB,2,United Kingdom,Europe
"Six of the eight pounds of feed he fowed upon half an acre of ground, in March, in the year 1761, with a quarter of a peck of fpring-wheat, both by hand.

On the fixed air contained in thefe bodies, he found their property of effervefcing with acids to depend, as likewife their mildnefs ; both the alcalies and calcareous earth being highly cauftic when deprived of their fixed air.

The corfairs, or pirates, form each a fmall re¬ public, of which the rais or captain is the fupreme bafhaw; who, with the officers under him, form a kind of douwan, in which every matter relating to the vef¬ fel is decided in an arbitrary way. Thefe corfairs are chiefly inftrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by way of mer- chandife or prizes. Thefe confift chiefly of gold and filver ftuffs, damalks, cloths, fpices, tin, iron, plated brafs, lead, quickfilver, cordage, fail-cloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, alum, rice, fugar, foap, cot¬ ton raw and fpun, copperas, aloes, brazil and log¬ wood, vermilion, &c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world; the oil, wax, hides, pulfe and corn produced, being but barely fufficient to fupply the country; though, before the lofs of Oran, the merchants have been known to (hip off from one or other of the ports of Barbary feveral thoufand tons of corn. The confumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewife fo confiderable in this kingdom, that it is feldom permitted to be ftiipped off for Eu¬ rope. The other exports confift chiefly in oftriches feathers, copper, ruggs, filk fafties, embroidered hand¬ kerchiefs, dates, and Chriftian flaves. Some manu- fa&ures in filk, cotton, wool, leather, &c. are car¬ ried on in this country, but moftly by the Spaniards fettled here, efpeciaily about the metropolis. Carpets are alfo a manufacture of the country, which, though much inferior to thofe of Turkey, both in beauty and finenefs, are preferred by the people to lie upon, on account of their being both cheaper and fofter. There are alfo, at Algiers, looms for velvet, taffaties, and o- ther wrought filks ; and a coarfe fort of linen is like¬ wife made in moft parts of the kingdom. gt The inhabitants along the fea-coafts are a mixture Inhabitants ( of different nations; but chiefly Moors and Morefcos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain.

The Bere- bers are fame of the mod ancient inhabitants of the country; and are fuppofed to be defcended from the ancient Sabeans, who came hither from Arabia Felix, under the conduct of one of their princes. Others be¬ lieve them to be fome of the Canaanites driven out of Paleftine by Jofhua. Thefe are difperfed all over Bar¬ bary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their refpeftive chiefs: moft of them inhabit the mountainous parts; fome range from place to place, and live in tents, or portable huts; others in fcattered villages: they have, neverthelefs, kept themfelves for the moft part from in¬ termixing with other nations.

For a long time they had no rivals as hunters and warriors, and were long in alliance with the Iroquois ; whom they agreed to proteil from all invaders, and to let them have a lhare of their venifon. The Iroquois, on the other hand, were to pay a tribute to their allies, out of the culture of the earth; and to perform for them all the menial duties, fuch as flaying the game, curing the flefti, and dreffing the flrins.

"Natural allegiance is fuch as is due from all men born within the king’s dominions immediately upon their birth. For, immediately upon their birth, they are un¬ der the king’s proteftion; at a time too, when (during their infancy) they are incapable of protefting them- felves. Natural allegiance is, therefore, a debt of gra¬ titude; which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or alter¬ ed, by any change of time, place, or circumftance, nor by any thing but the united concurrence of the legifla- ture. A Briton who removes to France, or to China, owes the fame allegiance to the king of Britain there, as at home, and twenty years hence as well as now'. For it is a principle of univerfal law. That the natural-born fubjeft of one prince cannot by any aft of his own, no, not by fwearing allegiance to another, put off or dif- charge his natural allegiance to the former: for this natural allegiance was intrinfic, and primitive, and an¬ tecedent to the other; and cannot be diverted Without the concurrent aft of that prince to whom it was firft due. Indeed the natural-born fubjeft of one prince, to whom he owes allegiance, may beentangledbyfubjefting himfelf abfolutely to another: but it is his own aft that brings him into thofe rtraits and difficulties, of owing fervice to two mafters; and it is unreafonable, that, by fuch voluntary aft of his own, he fhculd be able at plea- fure to unloofe thofe bands by which he is connefted to his natural prince",,"FR,CN",2,"France,China","Europe,Asia"

Some time after, the Britons being difeontented with Vortigern, and having with¬ drawn their allegiance from him, he returned to a caftle in Wales, where being befieged by Ambrofius, and the caftle taking fire, he periftied in the flames, and left his rival foie monarch of Britain; who now took upon him the imperial purple, after the manner of the Roman emperors. Geoffrey of Monmouth tells us, that Ambrofius built Stonehenge near Salifbury, in Wilt- flnre. Ambrofius, according to this hiftorian, coming to a monaftery near Caercaradoc, now Salijhnry, where three hundred Britifti lords, maffacred by Hengift, lay buried, and refolving to perpetuate the memory of this aftion, he ordered his workmen to prepare a large quantity of ftones and other materials.

A body of forces were accordingly fent into Ire¬ land, under Pendragon, Ambrofius’s brother, to fetch thefe ftones; but were oppofed in their attempt by Gil- liomanus king of the country, who derided the folly of the Britons in undertaking fo ridiculous an expedi¬ tion.

Alex¬ ander Mecham celebrates this fable in his poem De di- vinee fapientia laudibus.

"Indeed, fo many fyllems have been formed concerning them, that it is very difficult to obtain a true know¬ ledge of the moll fimple fa£ts.—If we may believe the Abbe Raynal, the Californians are fwarthier than the Mexicans; and fo pofitive is he in this opinion, that he .gives a reafon for it. “This difference of colour,” fays he, “ proves, that the civilized life of fociety fubverts, or totally changes, the order and laws of nature, fince we find, under the temperate zone, a favage people that are blacker than the civilized nations of the torrid zone.” —On the other hand, Dr Robertfon claffes all the in¬ habitants of Spanilh America together with regard to America, colour, whether they are civilized or uncivilized; and ~~ when he fpeaks of California, takes no notice of any peculiarity in their colour more than others.—Certain it is, however, that the northern inhabitants of Ame¬ rica are of a colour very different from the Europeans, or even the Afiatics, in the fame latitudes; nor are thofe who dwell under the line fo black as negroes.—The Robertfon’s general appearance of the Americans in various diftridts Hiflery of is thus defcribed by Don Antonia Ulloa. They have ^""^r.vol. I a very fmall fore-head, covered with hair towards its P‘4S<>"" extremities, as far as the middle of the eye-brows; little eyes; a thin nofe, fmall, and bending towards the up- er lip ; the countenance broad; the ears large ; the air very black, lank, and coarfe ; the limbs well turn¬ ed ; the feet fmall; the body of juft proportion, and al¬ together fmooth and free from hair, until old age, when they acquire fome beard, but never on the cheeks.” — The chevalier Pinto gives the following account of them. “ They are all of a copper colour, with fqme diverfity of fliade, not in proportion to their diftance from the Equator, but according to the degree of ele¬ vation of the territory in which they refide. Thofe who live in a high country are fairer than thofe in the marftiy low lands on the coaft. Their face is round; farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people, from an oval fhape. Their fore-head is fmall; the ex¬ tremity of their ears far from the face; their lips thick; their nofe flat; their eyes black, or of a cheftnut colour, fmall, but capable of difcerning objedts at a great di¬ ftance. Their hair is always thick and fleek, and with¬ out any tendency to curl. They have no hair on any part of their body but the head. At the firft afpedl, a South-American appears to be mild and innocent; but, on a more attentive view, one difcovers in his coun¬ tenance fomething wild, diftruftful, and fullen.” The Americans were alfo remarkable for their de¬ bility of body. They were'not only averfe to toil, but incapable of it; and when roufed by force from their native indolence, and compelled to work, they funk un¬ der talks which people of the other continent would have performed with eafe. On the continent, however, where many tribes employed themfelves in hunting, they acquired greater firmnefs; but ftill they were more remarkable for agility than ilrength. Of their fwiftnefs, indeed, furprifing accounts are given.

In their character, we flitute of a with, indeed, it were in our power to balance the bad good princi- qualities we have mentioned, with fome good ones; P*6, but we are forry to fay, that in all the different ac¬ counts of the native Americans which have fallen into our hands, the virtuous part of their chara&er hath conftantly been invifible. Their conftancy in bearing the moft horrid tortures without a complaint, hath been extolled as the greateft heroifm and magnanimity; but we cannot help thinking, it very naturally flows from their inconceivably cruel and blood-thirfty difpofition, along with theit infatiable defire of revenge, the mean- 41 eft as well as the moft diabolical paffion in the human Inftances of nature. Perfonal courage they have not; as appears their cow- from the following incidents, quoted from Charlevoix, ardice. ^ Lord Kaimes, in his Sketches of the Hiftory of *B. I. Sk.I. Man *. “ The fort de Vercheres in Canada, belong¬ ing to the French, was, in the year 1690, attacked by fome Iroquois: they approached filently, preparing to fcalet he palifade, when fome mufquet-ftiot made them retire. Advancing a fecond time, they were again re- pulfed, wondering that they could difcover none but a woman, who was feen every where. This was Madame de Vercheres, who appeared as refolute as if fupport- ed by a numerous garrifon. The hopes of ftorming a place without men to defend it, occafioned reiterated attacks. After two days fiege, they retired, fearing to be intercepted in their retreat. Two years after, a party of the fame nation appeared before the fort fo unex- peftedly, that a girl of fourteen, daughter of the pro- prietor, had but time to fhut the gate. With the young woman, there was not a foul but one raw foldier. She fliewed herfelf with her afliftant, fometimes in one place, and fometimes in another; changing her drefs frequently, in order to give fome appearance of a gar¬ rifon ; and. always fired opportunely. The faint-heart¬ ed Iroquois decamped without fuccefs.” We are fenfible, that, in denying perfonal courage to the Americans, we differ from the learned Dr Robert- fon ; who attributes their method of making war to a policy adapted to the fmallnefs of their number, and urges their defperate valour on fome extraordinary oc ■ cafions as a proof of their courage. To this it might eafily be replied, that, none will fight fo defperately as cowards, when they are prevented from running away; and, therefore, it was a maxim among the Spartans, never to purfue a flying enemy too clofely, “ left he fhould. think it better to fight, than run away.” Be- fides, favage cruelty hath in all ages been reckoned a America, fign of cowardice: and we believe there are but few, (in which number we would not wifh to include the’ Doftor) that will not ftigmatize, as the moft infamous cowards, thofe who will not face their enemies in the open field, but murder them, together with their help- 42 lefs women and infants, when afleep.

Plants were created of dif¬ ferent kinds, to fit them for different climates ; and fo wrere brute animals. Certain it is, that all men are not fitted equally for every climate. There is fcarce a climate but what is natural to fome men, where they profper and flourifh; and there is not a climate but where fome men degenerate. Doth not then analogy lead us to conclude, that, as there are different climates on the face of this globe, fo there are different races of men fitted for thefe different climates? “ M. Buffon, from the rule, That animals which can procreate together, and whofe progeny can alfo pro¬ create, are of one fpecies; concludes, that all men are of one race or fpecies ; and endeavours to fupport that fa¬ vourite opinion, by aferibing to the climate, to food, or to other accidental caufes, all the varieties that are found amonghnen. But is he ferioufly of opinion, that any operation of climate, or of other accidental caufe, can account for the copper-colour and fmooth chin u- niverfal among the Americans; the prominence of the pudenda univerfal among the Hottentot women, or .the black nipple no lefs univerfal among the female Sa- moiedes?—It is in vain to aferibe to the climate, the low ftature of the Efquimaux, the fmallnefs of their feet, or the overgrown fize of their heads. It is equally in vain to aferibe to climate, the low ftature of the Laplanders, or their ugly vifage.

The difeafe is then called epiplocele, for the Greeks gave the name of epiploon, to this vifeus.

Upon this he defired to be bapti¬ zed; and, in memory of the calling of St John and St Andrew, he received the name John Andreas. “ Ha¬ ving received holy orders (fayshe), and, from an alfaqui and a flave of Lucifer, become a prieft and minifter of Chrift; I began, like St Paul, to preach and publifh the contrary of what I had erroneoufly believed and afferted ; and, with the affiftance of Almighty God, AND Andreas J converted at firll a great many fouls of the Moors, (J'’bn) who were in danger of hell, and under the dominion Andrelinas Lucifer, and conduced them into the way of falva-    tion. After this, I was fent for by the moll catholic prince, king Ferdinand, and queen Ifabella, in order to preach in Granada to the Moors of that kingdom, which their majefties had conquered: by God’s blef- fing on my preaching, an infinite number of Moors were brought to abjure Mahomet, and to turn to Chrift. A little after this, I was made a canon by their grace; and fent for again by the moll Chriftian queen Ifabella to Arragon, that I might be employed in the converfion of the Moors of thofe kingdoms, who ftill perfifted in their errors, to the great contempt and dilhonour of our crucified Saviour, and the prodigious lofs and danger of all Chriftian princes. But this ex¬ cellent and pious defign of her majefty was rendered in- effe£lual by her death.” At the defire of Martin Gar¬ cia, bilhop of Barcelona, he undertook to tranllate from the Arabic, into the language of Arragon, the whole law of the Moors ; and after having finilhed this undertaking, he compofed his famous work of Ths Confufton of the Sett of Mahumed; it contains twelve chapters, wherein he has collefted the fabulous ftories, impoftures, forgeries, brutalities, follies, obfcenities, absurdities, impoflibilities, lies, and contradi&ions, which Mahomet, in order to deceive the fimple peo¬ ple, has difperfed in the writings of that feft, and e- fpecially in the alcoran, which, as he fays, was revealed to him in one night by an angel, in the city of Meke; though in another place he contradicts himfelf, and af¬ firms that he was 20 years in compofing it. Andreas tells us, he wrote this work, that not only the learned amongft Chriftians, but even the common people might know the different belief and doCtrine of the Moors ; and on the one hand might laugh and ridicule fuch in- folent and brutal notions, and on the other might la¬ ment their blindnefs and dangerous condition.

Here they were known, even in the time of Tacitus, by the name of Angli. The origin of this name is varioufly accounted for. According to Saxo-Grammaticus, they were called Angli from one Angulus, fon to Humblus king of Denmark. Widifchind, a Saxon writer, will have them to be called Angli, from an ifland in the corner or angle of the fea, which they conquered. Gordpius derives their name from the Saxon word Angel, or Engel, fignifying a'filh-hook; the Angles, like the other Saxon nations, being greatly addi&ed to piracy, and on that account being fo named by the neighbouring nations; as if, like hooks, they caught all that was in the fea. To this nation the Britifh ambafla- dors are faid to have applied when foliciting fuccours sgainft the Scots and Pidts.

"A N S rank of nobility. He was the fon of William Anfon, Efq; of Huckborough, in Staffordfhire; and, fhewing an early inclination for the fea, received a fuitable edu¬ cation. The firft command he enjoyed was that of the Weazle floop, in 1722 ; but the moft memorable aftion of his life, and the foundation of his future good for¬ tune, took place on his receiving the command of five fhips, a floop, and two viftuallers, equipped to annoy the Spaniards in the South feas, and to co-operate with admiral Vernon acrofs the Ifthmus of Darien : an ex¬ pedition the principal object of which failed by the unaccountable delay in fitting him out. He failed, however, in Sept. 1740; doubled Cape Horn in a dan¬ gerous feafon ; loft moft of his men by the fcurvy ; and with unly one remaining (hip, the Centurion, crofted the great Pacific Ocean. If no confiderable national ad ¬ vantage refulted from this voyage, Commodore Anfon made his own fortune, and enriched his furviving com¬ panions, by the capture of a rich galleon on her paffage from Acapulco to Manilla ; with which he returned home round the Cape of Good Hope. If he was lucky in meeting this galleon, he was no lefs fortunate in efcaping a French fleet then cruifing in the channel, by failing through it during a fog. He arrived at Spithead in June 1744. In a (hort time after his return, he was appointed rear-admiral of the blue, and one of the lords of the admiralty. In April 1745, he was made rear- admiral of the white, and the following year vice-ad¬ miral of the blue ; at which time he was chofen to re- prefent the borough of Heydon in parliament. In 1747, being on board the Prince George of 90 guns, in Company with Admiral Warren, and twelve other drips, he intercepted, off Cape Finifterre, a powerful fleet, bound from France to the Eaft and Weft Indies; when, by his valoiir and conduit, he again enriched himfelf and his officers, and at the fame time ftrength- ened the Britifh navy, by taking fix men of war and four Eaft-Indiamen, not one of them efcaping.

"From this time, the colony of Antigua began to flourifli, chiefly through the prudent management of colonel Chriftopher Codrington; who, having been ap¬ pointed captain-general, and general-governor of all the Leeward iflands, removed from Barbadoes to An¬ tigua, which he made the feat of his government; and here, by his great knowledge and experience in Weft- India plantations, he introduced a new and better fy- ftem of colonizing and improving. It was not in his power, however, to prevent the effefts of thofe dread¬ ful hurricanes to which the ifland is fubjeft, and which more than once in his time rendered it a feene of de- folation, particularly in 1681 ; and nine years after, it was almoft entirely ruined by an earthquakes The Indians, inftigated by the French, never failed to avail themfelves of thofe natural calamities by ma¬ king defeents upon the ifland; but after having plun¬ dered the plantations neareft the fea, they were gene¬ rally driven off with lofs.

On thefe occafions the French privateers were partly manned with Irifli Roman-ca¬ tholics, whom the inhabitants found to be their moft cruel enemies. To make themfelves fome amends for thefe depredations, the Antiguans made a defeent up¬ on the French ifland of Marigalante, where they took and burnt the chief town, demolifhed the fort and fpi- ked up its guns, drove the inhabitants into the woods,, and returned to Antigua laden with plunder",,"FR,IN",2,"France,India","Europe,Asia"
"Notwithftanding thefe (kirmilhes, the trade of An¬ tigua continued to flourifli, fo that in 1696, eleven load¬ ed (hips were fent from the ifland at one time.

Here he firft diflodged the enemy from a poft called Le petits Habitam, and having landed about 8oo more men, they boldly marched up to a town called the Bayliffe, where the French had manned a breaft-work, which they vigoroufly defended, and killed three En- glifti captains at the head of their grenadiers. But the Englifli foldiers having brilkly kept up their (ire, at laft laid the muzzles of their pieces acrofs the top of the breaft-work, and foon became mafters of it. This was followed by the conqueft of all the other breaft- works, of the town of Bayliffe itfelf, and of the Jaco- bine church and plantation, both of which were ftrong- ly fortified.

"“ Below even this fpacious grotto, there feemed an¬ other cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and defcended about 50 paces by means of a rope. I at laft arrived at a fmall fpot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being compofed of foft clay, yielding to the preffure, and in which I thruft a ftick to about fix feet deep. In this, however, as above* numbers of the moft beautiful cryftals were formed; one of which, particularly, refembled a table. Upon our egrefs from this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek infcription upon a rock at the mouth; but fo obliterated by time, that we could not read it. It feemed to import, that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come thither ; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us.” From this account Mr Tournefort’s differs confide- rably. Mr Magni mentions only one defcent or pre¬ cipice from the entry of the cave to the grotto, or moft magnificent part: Mr Tournefort fays that there were many very dangerous precipices and rugged ways, through which they were obliged to pafs fometimes on their back, and fometimes on their belly; but gives no particular account of his journey till he comes to the grand cavern. This indeed he defcribes very pompouf- ly; but as by it he evidently wants to fupport a favou¬ rite hypothefis, namely, the vegetation of ftones, per¬ haps the particulars are not altogether to be depended upon. He informs us, that, at the entry into the ca¬ vern, he met with a Greek infcription almoft defaced, containing a good number of proper names; and that there was a tradition among the inhabitants, that thefe were the names of fome who had confpired againft A- lexander the Great, and having miffed their aim, had taken refuge in this grotto",,GR,2,Greece,Europe

By this means he acquired a tafte for poetry, and enriched his mind with noble ideas. He firft attempted to tranflate fome pieces of Ovid, Horace, and other ancients; and, having formed his tafte on thefe excellent models, he at length undertook one of the moft difficult tafks in poetry, to write a tragedy: this was intitled Traz'd, or The Invajion of China.

"During this war with the Parthians, about the year 163 or 164, Antoninus fent his daughter Lucilla to Verus, fhe having been betrothed to him in marriage, and attended her as far as Brundufium: he intended to have conduced her to Syria ; but it having been infi- nuated by fome perfons,that his defign of going into the eaft, was to claim the honour of having finilhed the Parthian war, he returned to Rome. The Romans ha- ving gained a vi&ory over the Parthians, who were obliged to abandon Mefopotamia, the two emperors triumphed over them at Rome, in the year 166 ; and were honoured with the title of Fathers of their coun¬ try. This year was fatal, on account of a terrible pefti- lence which fpread itfelf over the whole world, and a famine under which Rome laboured: it was likewife in this year that the Marcomanni, and many other peo¬ ple of Germany, took up arms againft the Romans; but the two emperors having marched in perfon againft them, obliged the Germans to fue for peace.

"In the year 170, Antoninus made vaft preparations againft the Germans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is faid to have happened, which, according to Dion Caflius, was as follows: Antoninus’s army being block¬ ed up by the Quadi, in a very difadvantageous place, where there was no poffibility of procuring water; in this fituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppreffed with heat and thirft, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an inftant the Iky was co¬ vered with clouds, and there fell a vaft quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thirft, when the enemy came upon them with fuch fury, that Antoninus they muft certainly Lave been defeated, had it not been for a fliower of hail, accompanied with a ftorm of thun¬ der and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the leaft annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the vidfory (b). ^In 175, Antoninus made a .treaty with feveral nations of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Caffius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor : this infurreftion, however, was put an end to by the death of Caflius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards thofe who had been engaged in Caflius’s p^r- ty : he would not put to death, nor imprifon, nor even fit in judgment himfelf upon any of the fenators enga- ed in this revolt; but he referred them to the fenate, xing a day for their appearance, as if it had been on¬ ly a civil affair. He wrote alfo to the fenate, defiririg them to a£b with indulgence rather than feverity; not to filed the blood of any fenator or perfon of quality, or of any other perfon whatfoever, but to allow this ho¬ nour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loft their lives, except in the firft heat of the tumult. In 176, Antoninus vifited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thofe countries, and ambaf- fadors alfo from Parthia, came to vifit him. He ftaid feyeral days at Smyrna; and, after he had fettled the affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his fon Commodus, whom, he chofe conful for the year fol¬ lowing, though he was then but 16 years of age, ha¬ ving obtained a difpenfation for that purpofe. On the 27th of September, the fame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commodus, on account of the vi&ories gained over the Germans. Dion Caflius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himfelf and the public treafury during 46 years, from the time that Hadrian had granted the fame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thofe debts. He applied himfelf likewife to correct many enormities, and introduced feveral excellent regulations. In the year 179, he left Rome with his fon Commodus, in order to go againft the Marcomanni, and other barba¬ rous nations; and the year following gained a confider- able vi&ory over them, and would, in all probability, have entirely fubdued them in a very ftiort time, had he not been taken with an illnefs, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign. The whole empire regret¬ ted the lofs of fo valuable a prince, and paid the great- eft regard to his memory: he was ranked amongft the gods, and almoft every perfon had a ftatue of him in their houfes. His book of Meditations has been much admired (a) Eufebius has preferred this letter, Hift. Fcclef. lib. iv. cap. 13. but he falfely afcribes it to Antoninus Pius, whereas it was wrote by Marcus Antoninus, as Valerius makes it appear in his annotations on Eufebius","Roman, Smyrna, Athens, Rome, Rome, Rome, March","US,SY,DE,EG,RO,GB",2,"United States,Syrian Arab Republic,Germany,Egypt,Romania,United Kingdom","North America,Asia,Europe,Africa,Europe,Europe"
"(b) The pagans as well as Chriftians, according to Mr Tillemont (p. 621. art. xvi.), have acknowledged the truth of this prodigy, bnt have greatly differed as to the caufe of fuch a miraculous event; the former afcribing it, fome to one magician and fome to another: In Antoninus’s Pillar, the glory is afcribed to Jupiter the god of rain and thun¬ der.

"Wa'' Antoninus’s Wall, the name of the third rampart or defence that had been built oi1 repaired by the Romans againft the incurfions of the North Britons. It is call¬ ed by the people in the neighbourhood, Graham's Dyke; from the notion that one Graham, or Grimus, firft made a breach in it after the retreat of the Romans out of Bri¬ tain. The firft barrier erefted by the Romans was the t Sec dgri- chain of forts made by Agricola f from the frith of cola. porth to that of Clyde, in the year 81, to proteft his conquefts from the inroads of the Caledonians. The * See Adri- fecon(j was the vallum, or dyke, flung up by Adrian * in the year 121. It terminated on the weftern fide of the kingdom, at Axelodunum, or Brugh, on the Solway fands; and was fuppofed to have reached no further than Pons JElii, or Newcajlle, on the eaftern. But from an infeription lately difeovered, it appears to have ex- 4 See Seve- tended as far as the wall of Severus if. This rampart m' of Adrian’s was fituated much further fouth than A- gricola’s chain; the country to the north having been either, according to fome authors, recovered by the na¬ tive Britons after the departure of Agricola; or, ac¬ cording to others, voluntarilyflighted by Adrian. How¬ ever, this work of Adrian’s did not long continue to be the extreme boundary of the Roman territories to the north in Britain. For Antoninus Pius, the adopted fon and immediate fucceffor of Adrian, having, by his lieutenant Lollius Urbicus, recovered the country once conquered by Agricola, commanded another rampart to be erefted between the friths of Forth and Clyde, in the trail where Agricola had formerly built his chain of forts. The great number of inferiptions which have been found in or near the ruins of this wall, or rampart, to the honour of Antoninus Pius, leave us no room to doubt its having been built by his direction and com¬ mand. If the fragment of a Roman pillar with an in¬ feription, now in the college library of Edinburgh, be¬ longed to this work, as it is generally fuppofed to have done, it fixes the date of its execution to the third confullhip of Antoninus, which was A. D. 140, only 20 years after that of Adrian, of which this feems to have been an imitation. This wall or rampart, as fome imagine, reached from Caer-ridden on the frith of Forth, to Old Kirkpatrick on the Clyde; or, as o- thers think, from Kinniel on the eaft, to Dunglafs on the weft. Thefe different fuppofitions hardly make a mile of difference in the length of this work, which, from feveral ailual menfurations, appears to have been 37 Englilh or 40 Roman miles. Capitolinus, in his life of Antoninus Pius, diredlly affirms, that the wall which that emperor built in Britain was of turf. This in the main is unqueftionably true; though it is evident (from the veftiges of it ftill remaining, which not very many years ago were dug up and examined for near a mile together) that the foundation was of ftone. Mr Cam¬ den alfo tells us, from the papers of one Mr Anthony Pont, that the principal rampart was faced with fquare ftone, to prevent the earth from falling into the ditch","Wa, Graham, Graham, Adrian, Adrian, Adrian, Adrian, Roman, Adrian, Roman, Edinburgh, Adrian, Roman","US,RO,GH,GB",2,"United States,Romania,Ghana,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Africa,Europe"

From thefe inferiptions it ap¬ pears in general, that this great work was executed by the fecond legion, the vexillations of the fixth legion and of the twentieth legion, and one cohort of auxilia¬ ries. If thefe corps were all complete, they would make in all a body of 7800 men. Some of thefe in¬ feriptions have fuffered greatly by the injuries of time and other accidents; fo that we cannot difeover from them with abfolute certainty, how many paces of thig work were executed by each of thefe bodies of troops",Edinburgh,GB,2,United Kingdom,Europe

After having gone through a courfe of philofophy and divinity in his own country, he went to ftudy law at Salamanca, where he clofely attended the lectures of Francifco Ramos del Manzano, afterwards counfellor to the king, and pre¬ ceptor to Charles II. Upon his return to Seville, after he had finilhed his law-ftudies at Salamanca, he Ihut himfelf up in the royal monaftery of Benedi&ines, where he employed himfelf feveral years in writing his Bibliotheca Hifpanica, having the ufe of the books of Bennet de la Sana, abbot of that monaftery, and dean of the faculty of divinity at Salamanca.

Curio, however, was fo generous as to bail him for 250 talents.

"Aratus, a Greek poet, born at Soli, or Solae, a town in Cilicia, which afterwards changed its name, 4 E and A R A [* 590 ] ARB and was called Pompeiopolis, in honour of Pompey the Great. He flourilhed about the 124th, or, according to forne, the 126th Olympiad, in the reign of Ptole¬ my Philadelphus king of Egypt. He difcovered in his youth a remarkable poignancy of wit, and capaci¬ ty for improvement ; and having received his education under Dionyfius Heracleotes, a Stoic philofopher, he efpoufed the principles of that deft. Aratus was phy- fician to Antigonus Gonatus, the fon of Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedon : this prince, being a great encourager of learned men, fent for him to court, admitted him to his intimacy, and encouraged him in his ftudies. The Phenomena of Aratus, which is ftill extant, gives him a title to the charafter of an aftro- nomer, as well as a poet; in this piece he defcribes the nature and motion of the ifars, and fhews the particular influences of the heavenly bodies, with their various dif- politions and relations. He wrote this poem in Greek verfe: it was tranflated into Latin by Cicero ; who tells us, in his firltbook De oratore, that the verfes of A- ratus are very noble. This piece was tranflated by o- thers as well as Cicero ; there being a tranflation by Germanicus Csefar, and another into elegant verfe by Feftus Avienus. An edition of the Phenomena was publifliedby Grotius, at Leyden, in quarto, 1600, in Greek and Latin, with the fragments of Cicero’s verfion, and the tranflations of Germanicus and Avie¬ nus, all which the editor has illuftrated with curious notes. He was certainly much efteemed by the an¬ cients, frnce we find fo great a number of fcholiafts and commentators upon him. There are feveral other works alfo afcribed to Aratus. Suidas mentions the following: Hymns to Pan; Aftrology and Aftrothefy; a compofition of Antidotes; an EkiSvIixov on Theopro- pus; an Hdoxout on Antigonus ; an Epigram on Phila, tfie daughter of Ahtipater, and wife of Antigonus ; an Epicedium of Cleombrotus; a Corre6fion of the Odyffey ; and fome Epiftles, in profe. Virgil, in his Georgies, has imitated or tranflated many paffages from this author; and St Paul has quoted a pafiage of Aratus.

It is famous for the laft and deciiive battle fought in its neighbourhood between Alexander the Great and Darius Codoman- nus. This battle was fought 331 years before Chrift, and the event of it determined the fate of the Perfian empire. Arrian relates, that Darius’s army coniifted of a million of foot, and 40,000 horfe ; according to Diodorus, there were 200,000horfe, and 800,000 foot;' Plutarch relates, that the horfe and foot together made up a million ; and Juftin gives us exa6ily half Diodo¬ rus’s number. The Macedonian army, according to Arrian, confifted of 40,000 foot, and 7000 horfe. To prevent the endeavours of Darius to furround them, Alexander caufed his front to be extended as wide as poflible without weakening the centre. Darius’s front was covered with 200 chariots armed with feythes* whofe appearance was very terrible, and threatened de- ftru&ion to the whole army; but Alexander’s light¬ armed troops killed many of the horfes and drivers, fo that few reached the Macedonian line, which open¬ ing as Alexander had direded, they onlypaffed thro’, and were then either taken or difabled by his bodies of referve. Some ancient writers deferibe this battle very particularly: but as the Macedonians loft only 30a men, while the Perfians had 30,000 killed, according, to Arrian; 40,000, according to Curtius; and 90,000, according to Diodorus; it is impoffible the Perfians could have made any great refiftance. Indeed, as the compilers of the Univerfal Hiftory obferve, “ had the 7 or 800,000 men which Darius brought into the field thrown each one dart, or one ftone, the Macedonians could never have bought the empire of the eaft at f» eafy ARB [ 59i ] ARB Arberg eafy a rate.” Darius, on feeing his numerous army fo II fhamefnlly put to flight, was fome time in fufpence Arhon- whether or not he fhould put an end to his life ; but, being perfuaded by his friends, or probably hurried a- way by the multitude who fled, he was obliged to fly with the reft ; and arrived at Arbela the fame night",,MK,2,North Macedonia,Europe

Before this period, the Ruffian commodities were ufually conveyed to Narva, in the gulph of Finland: but the channel of trade was foon turned to Archangel, and this traffic the Englifh for fome time enjoyed without competition.

Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effeft, that the walls of Babylon could have been 318 feet high, and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhew us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium, and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it mull contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiltorians, this immenfe mafs of building was fmifhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchednezzar, or whoever fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for ten years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as llrongly as it is faid to have been ; *for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly fo, amounting to 18,189,600 folid fathoms. When our author afterwards gafconades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power, tafte, and time, to finilh Verfailles, with all its defe&s, than to confiruA a pyramid, or e- re& an obelilk.” The genius, tafte, and time, we (hall not difpute ; but as the fame author confefles that 100,000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftruflion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time the abovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fome of the works of which M. Goguet boafts fo much.

"How magnificent the Romans were in their temples and public buildings, is yet to be feen in what remains of them, and which are not only models for all modern architedls, but have never been furpaffed or even equal¬ led to this day. But though the art of architefture continued almofl at its higheft pitch among the Ro¬ mans for two centuries, it declined exceedingly as the empire began to fail. Tacitus relates, that after the battle of Adlium no men of genius appeared ; and af¬ ter the reign of Alexander Severus, a manner of build¬ ing altogether confufed and irregular was introduced, wherein nothing of the true graces and majefty of the former was preferved. When the empire was entirely over-run by the Goths, the conquerors naturally intro¬ duced their own method of building. Like the ancient Egyptians, the Goths feem to have been more ftudious to amaze people with the greatnefs of their buildings, than to pleafe the eye with the regularity of their flruAure, or the propriety of their ornaments. They corredted themfelves, however, a little by the models of the Roman edifices which they faw before them : but thefe models themfelves were faulty; and the Goths being totally deftitute. of genius, nefther architedlure, nor any other art, could be improved by them",Roman,RO,2,Romania,Europe
"When the Arabs conquered Spain, they introduced a mode of architedlure which was juft the reverfe of the Gothic. This was as remarkable for its lightnefs as the Gothic was for its clumfinefs ; and the fantaftic genius of the Arabs difplayed itfelf in the great number of fuperfluous and unnatural ornaments wherewith it was loaded. Examples of this kind of building are extant in fome cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors, par¬ ticularly that of Burgos. It is falfely, though com¬ monly, called the modern Gothic. zx In the 15th and 16th centuries, when learning of all Revival of kinds began to revive, architedlure feemed as it were 1116 art- to be recalled intodife. The firft improvements in it began in Italy, and owed their exiftence to the many ruins of the ancient Roman flrudlures that were to be found in that country, from whence an improved me¬ thod of building was gradually brought into the other countries of Europe: and though the Italians for a long time retained the fuperionty as architedls over the other European nations; yet, as men of genius tra¬ velled from all quarters into Italy, where they had an opportunity of feeing the originals from whence the Italians copied, architedls have arifen in other nations equal, if not fuperior, to any that ever appeared in I- taly.

Having there¬ fore determined the meafures of your column, (that is to fay, the height of the (haft, and its inferior and PlateXXV. fuperior diameters), draw a line indefinitely from C (B)* through D, perpendicular to the axis of the column : this done, fet off the diftance C D, which is the infe¬ rior femi-diameter, from A, the extreme point of the fuperior femi-diameter, to B, a point in the axis; then from A, through B, draw the line ABE, which will cut the indefinite line C D in E; and, from this point of interfedlion E, draw thro’ the axis of the column any number of rays as E b a, on each of which, from the axis towards the circumference, fetting off the in¬ terval C D, you may find any number of points, a, a, a, through which if a curve be drawn, it will defcribe the 45 fwelling and diminution of the column.” Nice- Though this method be fufficiently accurate for medes’s in- pra£tice, efpecially if a confiderable number of points ftrument. foun(j} yet, ftri&ly fpeaking, it is defeftive ; as the curve muft either be drawn by hand, or by applying a flexible ruler to all the points; both of which are liable to variations. Blondcl therefore, to obviate this objeftion, (after having proved the curye palling from A to C through the points a a, to be of the fame na¬ ture with the firft conchoid of the ancients), employed the inftrument of Nicomedes to defcribe it} the con- ilru&ion of which is as follows : Having determined, as above, the length of the fliaft, with the inferior and fuperior diameters of the column, and having likewife found the length of the line C D E, take three rulers, either of wood or me¬ tal, as F G, I D, and A H; of which let F G and I E) be faftened together at right angles in G.

"Species, Of this genus there are 21 different fpecies; but only the four following merit defeription. 1. The rotunda, is a native of the fouth of France, of Spain, and Italy, from whence the roots are brought for me¬ dicinal ufe. The roots are roundiih, grow to the fize of fmall turnips, being in fhape and colour like the roots of cyclamens, which are frequently fold inftead of them. This fort hath three or four weak trailing branches, which lie on the ground when they are not fupported, and extend two feet in length; the leaves are heart-ftiaped and rounded at their extremity ; the flowers come out fingly at every leaf, toward the upper part of the ftalk. They are of a purplifh black colour; and are frequently fucceeded by oval feed-veffels, ha¬ ving fix cells, full of flat feeds. 2. The longa, is a na¬ tive of the fame countries. This fpecies hath long tap¬ roots like carrots ; the branches are weak and trailing, extending little more than a foot; the flowers come out from the wings of the leaves like the other, are of a pale purple colour, and are frequently fucceeded by feed-veffels like the other. 3. The ferpentaria, is a na¬ tive of Virginia and Carolina, from whence radix Ariftolo- Jerpentarise, fo much ufed in medicine, is brought over. chia- The plant rifes out of the ground in one, two, and fometimes three pliant ftalks, which at every little di- ftance are crooked or undulated. The leaves ftand al¬ ternately, and are about three inches long, in form fomewhat like the fmilax afpera. The leaves grow clofe to the ground on footftalks an inch long, of a Angular fhape, and of a dark purple colour. A round canulated capfule fucceeds the flower. It is filled with feeds, which are ripe in May. The ufual price of the root when dried is 6 d. per ;pound, both in Virginia and Carolina, which is money hardly earned; yet the negro flaves employ great part of the time allowed them by their mafters in fearch of it, which is the reafon that there are feldom found any but very fmall plants of this fpecies. When they are planted in gardens in thofe countries where they are natives, the plants in- creafe fo much in two years time, that the hand can fcarce grafp the ftalks of a fingle one. This fpecies delights in woods, and is ufually found near the roots of great trees, 4. The indica, or contrayerva of Ja¬ maica, is a native of that ifiand, where its roots are ufed inftead of the true contrayerva. It hath long trailing branches, which climb upon the neighbouring plants, and fometimes rife to a confiderable height. The flowers are produced in fmall clufters towards the up¬ per part of the ftalks, which are of a dark purple co¬ lour","Of, Virginia, Carolina, Virginia, Carolina","ZA,PR,FR,ES,IT,TR",2,"South Africa,Puerto Rico,France,Spain,Italy,Turkey","Africa,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Asia"

If they are plunged into a gentle hot-bed in the month of March, the plants will come up the fooner. In fum- mer, and in autumn when the ftalks begin to decay, they muft be watered. In winter they muft be again flickered; and in March, before the roots begin to flioot, they muft be tranfplanted into fmall feparate pots filled with light earth, when they may be removed in¬ to the open air, and treated as before. The next fpring, they may be planted in the open air in a warm border; where, in the autumn, when their ftalks decay, if the border is covered with old tanners bark to keep out the froft, the roots will be fecured; but where this care is not taken, they will frequently be killed by the froft","March, March",GB,2,United Kingdom,Europe
"The Acharnenfes was written after the death of Pericles, and the lofs of the battle in Sicily, in order to diffuade the people from intruding the fafety of the common¬ wealth to fuch imprudent generals as Lamachus. Soon after, he reprefented his Aves, or Birds; by which he admoniftied the Athenians to fortify Decelsea, which he calls by a fictitious name Nephelococcygia. The Arifto- Vefpse, or Wafps, was written after another lofs in Sicily, which the Athenians fuffered from the mifeon- ■, , duct of Chares. He wrote the Lyjijlrata when all Greece was involved in a war ; in which comedy the women are introduced debating upon the affairs of the commonwealth, when they come to a refolution, not to go to bed with their hulbands till a peace (hould be concluded. His Plutus, and other comedies of that kind, were written after the magiftrates had given or¬ ders that no perfon (hould be expofed by name upon the ftage. He invented a peculiar kind of verfe, which w'as called by his name, and is mentioned by Cicero in his Brutus; and Suidas fays, that he alfo was the inventor of the tetrameter and oftameter verfe",Cicero,"GR,US",2,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"

The time of his death is unknown ; but it is certain he was living after the expulfion of the tyrants by Thrafybulus, whom he mentions in his Plutus and other comedies. There have been feveral editions and tranflations of this poet. Nicodemus Frifchin, a Ger¬ man, famous for his claflical knowledge, in the i6til century, tranflated Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, the Equites, and the Acharnenfes, into Latin verfe.

The Grecians, who took great pains to reftore learning in the 11th and following ages, applied much to the works of this philofopher, and many learned men wrote commentaries on his writings: amongft thefe were Alfarabius, Algazel, Avicenna, and Aver- roes. They taught his doftrine in Africa, and after¬ wards at Cordova in Spain. The Spaniards introduced his do&rine into France, with the commentaries of A- verroes and Avicenna ; and it was taught in the uni- verfity of Paris, until Amauri, having fupported fome particular tenets on the principles of this philofopher, was condemned of herefy, in a council held there in 1210, when all the works of Ariftotle that could be found were burnt, and the reading of them forbidden under pain of excommunication. This prohibition was confirmed, as to the phyfics and metaphyfics, in 1215, by the Pope’s legate; though at the fame time he gave leave for his logic to be read, inftead of St Auguftin’s ufed at that time in the univerfity.

That this, however, was very early introduced into the world, even before the flood, we may gather from the following expreffion in Enoch’s prophecy, as mentioned by the Apoftle Jude : “ Be¬ hold, the Lord cometh with ten thoufands of his faints.” This ffiews, that even at that time men had ideas of traduced him ever after.

John Meurfius next tranf- lated the three books of Ariftoxenus into Latin, from the MS. of Jof. Scaliger; but, according to Meibo- mius, very negligently. With thefe he printed at Ley¬ den, 1616, 410, Nicomachus and Alypius, two other Greek writers on mufic. After this, Meibomius col- lefted thefe mufical writers together; to which he ad¬ ded Euclid, Bacchius fenior, Ariftides Quintilianus; and publiftied the whole, with a Latin verfion and notes, from the elegant prefs of Elzevir, Amft. 1652","Venice, Euclid","US,GR",2,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"It is vifible in Indoftan, where the people are divided into cafts, which never mix even by marriage, and where every man follows his father’s trade. The Dutch lint-boors are a fimilar inftance : the fame families carry on the trade from generation to generation; and are accordingly ignorant and brutifh even beyond other Dutch peafants. The inhabitants of Buckhaven, a fea-port in the county of Fife, were originally a co¬ lony of foreigners, invited hither to teach our people the art of filhing.

Men upon Progrefs of whom the former had bellowed every convenience, ar/f' turned their thoughts to the latter. Beauty was ftu- died in objeCls of fight; and men of tafte attached themfelves to the fine arts, which multiplied their en¬ joyments and improved their benevolence. Sculpture and painting made an early figure in Greece ; which afforded plenty of beautiful originals to be copied in tbefe imitative arts. Statuary, a more fimple imita¬ tion than painting, was fooner brought to perfection: the llatue of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno by Po- lycletes, though the admiration of all the world, were executed long before the art of light and lhade was known.

"From the fine arts mentioned, we proceed to lite¬ rature. It is agreed, among all antiquaries, that the firft writings were in verfe, and that writing in profe 4 was of a much later date. The firft Greek who wrote Literary in profe was Pherecides Synis : the firft Roman was compofition Appius Caecus, who compofed a declamation againft Pyrrhus. The four books of the Chatah Shade, which is the facred hook of Hindoftan, are compofed in verfe ftanzas ; and the Arabian compofitions in profe followed long after thofe in verfe. To account for that Angular faCt, many learned pens have been employed ; but without fuccefs. By fome it has been urged, that as memory is the only record of events w'here writing is unknown, hiftory originally was compofed in verfe, for the fake of memory. This is not fatisfaCtory.

"Tragedy. The Greek ftage has been juftly admired among all polite nations. The tragedies of Sophocles and Eu¬ ripides in particular are by all critics held to be perfect in their kind, excellent models for imitation, but far a- bove rivallhip. - If the Greek llage was fo early brought to maturity, it is a phenomenon not a little Angular in the progrefs of arts. The Greek tragedy made a rapid progrefs from Thefpis to Sophocles and Euripides, whofe compofitions are wonderful produc¬ tions of genius, confidering that the Greeks at that period were but beginning to emerge from roughnefs and barbarity into a talle for literature. The compo¬ fitions of Efchylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, muft have been highly relifhed among a people who had no idea of any thing more perfect. We judge by com- parifon, and every work is held to be perfedl that has ino rival. It ought at the fame time to be kept in view, that it was not the dialogue which chiefly en¬ chanted the Athenians, nor variety in the pafiions re- prefented, nor perferfion in the aftors; but machinery and pompous decoration, joined with exquifite mufic",,GR,2,Greece,Europe
"One would imagine, however, that thefe compoli- tions were too Ample to enchant for ever ; as variety in aftion, fentiment, and paflion, is requifite, without which the ftage will not continue long a favourite en¬ tertainment: and yet we find not a fingle improve¬ ment attempted after the days of Sophocles and Euri¬ pides. The manner of performance, indeed, prevented abfolutely any improvement. A fluftuation of paflion and refined fentiments would have made no figure on the Grecian ftage. Imagine the difcording fcene be¬ tween Brutus and Caflius in Julius Caefar to be there exhibited, or the handkerchief in the Moor of Venice : how flight would be their effedl, when pronounced in a mafic, and through a pipe ? The workings of nature upon the countenance, and the fledlions of voice ex- preflive of various feelings, fo deeply affefting in mo¬ dern reprefentation, would have been entirely loft. If a great genius had arifen with talents for compofing a pathetic tragedy in perfeftion, he would have made no figure in Greece. An edifice muft have been eredled of a moderate fize : new aftors muft have been trained to a£l with a bare face, and to pronounce in their own voice.

The capital beauty of an epic poem ip, the feleftion of fuch incidents and circumftances as make a deep impreflion, keeping out of view every thing low or familiar. An account of a fingle battle employs the whole fifth book of the Iliad, and a great part of the fixth: yet in the whole there is no general adlion ; but unknown warriors, whom we never heard of before, killed at a diftance with an arrow or a jave¬ lin ; and every wound defcribed with anatomical accu¬ racy. The whole feventeenth book is employed in the conteft about the dead body of Patroclus, fluffed with minute circumftances, below the dignity of an epic poem. In fuch fcenes the reader is fatigued with end¬ lefs particulars; and has nothing to fupport him but the melody of Homer’s verfification. ro Having traced the progrefs of the fine arts toward Caufes of maturity, in a fummary way, the decline of thefe arts the decline comes next in order. An art, in its progrefs toward of the fine maturity, is greatly promoted by emulation; and, af-” S‘ ter arriving at maturity, its downfal is not lefs promo¬ ted by it. It is difficult to judge of perfedlion but by comparifon ; and an artift, ambitious, to outftrip his predeceffors; cannot fubmit to be an imitator, but muft ftrike out fomething new, which, in an art advanced to ripenefs, feldom fails to be a degeneracy. This caufe of the decline of the fine arts may be.illuftrated by various inftances. The perfection of vocal mufic is to accompany paflion, and to enforce fentiment. In ancient Greece, the province of mufic was well under- ftood ; which, being confined within its proper fphere, had an enchanting influence. Harmony at that time was very little cultivated, becaufe it was of very little ufe : melody reaches the heart, and it is by it chiefly that a fentiment is enforced, or a paffion foothed : har¬ mony, on the contrary, reaches the ear only; and it is a matter of undoubted experience, that the moft me¬ lodious airs admit but of very Ample harmony. Art- ifts, in latter times, ignorant why harmony was fo little regarded by the ancients, applied tbemfelves ferioufly to its cultivation ; and they have been wonderfully fuc- cefsful. But they have been fuccefsful at the expence of melody ; which, in modern compofitions,'' generally fpeaking, is loft amid the blaze of harmony. Thefe compofitions tickle the ear by the luxury of complica¬ ted founds, but feldom make any impreflion on the heart. The Italian opera, in its form, refembles the Greek tragedy, from which it is evidently copied; but very little in fubftance. In the latter, mufic being made fubfervient to fentiment, the dialogue is nervous and fublime : in the former, the whole weight is laid on mufic; and the dialogue, devoid of fentiment, is weak and fpiritlefs. ReftTefs man knows no golden mean, but will be attempting innovations without end.—By the fame ambition, architecture has vifibly declined from its perfedlion. The Ionic was the favourite order when architedlure was in its height of glory",,GR,2,Greece,Europe
"We may judge of this from Plautus, whofe compofi¬ tions are abundantly rude, though much admired by his ART [ 7H ] ART liis cotemporaries, being the Bed that exifted at that time. The exalted fpirit of the Romans hurried them on to the grand and beautiful; and literary produc¬ tions of all kinds were in perfeftion when Auguftus reigned. In attempting ftill greater perfe&ion, the Roman compofitions became a ftrange jumble of incon- fsftent parts : they were tumid and pompous ; and, at the fame time, full of antithefes, conceit, and tinfel wit. Every thing new in the fine arts pleafes, though lefs perfect than what we are accuftomed to ; and, for that reafon, fuch compofitions were generally relilh- ed. We fee not by what gradual Heps writers, af¬ ter the time of Auguftus, deviated from the patterns that were before them ; for no book of any moment after that time is preferved, till we come down to Se¬ neca, in whofe works nature and fimplicity give place to artificial thought and baftard wit. He was a great corrupter of the Reman tafte; and after him nothing was relifhed but brilliant ftrokes of dan- cy, with very little regard to fentiment: even Vir¬ gil and Cicero made no figure in comparifon. Lucan has a forced elevation of thought and ftyle, very diffi¬ cult to be fupported ; and, accordingly, he finks often into puerile refle&ions; witnefs his encomium on the river Po, which, fays he, Would equal the Danube, had it the fame number of tributary ftreams. Quinti¬ lian, a writer of true and claffical tafte, who was pro¬ tected and encouraged by Vefpafian, attempted to ftem the tide of falfe writing. His rhetoric is compofed in an elegant ftyle; and his obfervations contain every de¬ licacy of the critical art. At the fame time flourifhed Tacitus, pofieffing a more extenfive knowledge of the nature of man than any other author, ancient or mo¬ dern, if Shakefpeare be not excepted. His ftyle is ori¬ ginal, concife, compact, and comprehenfive ; and, in what is properly called his hijiory, perfectly correft and beautiful. He has been imitated by feveral, but never equalled by any. Brutus is faid to be the laft of the Romans for love of liberty : Quintilian and Tacitus may be faid to be the laft of the Romans for literary genius. Pliny the Younger is no exception: his ftyle is affedled, turgid, and full of childifh brilliancy. Se¬ neca and Pliny are proper examples of writers who ftu- dy fhow more than fnbftance, and who make fenfe yield to found. The difference between thefe authors and thofe of the Auguftan age, refembles the difference be¬ tween Greek and Italian mufic. Mufic, among the Greeks, limited itfelf to the employment to which it is deftined by nature, viz. to be the handmaid of fenfe, to inforce, enliven, or fweeten a fentiment. In the Ita¬ lian opera, the miftrefs is degraded to be handmaid; a,nd harmony triumphs, with very little regard to fen¬ timent","Roman, Cicero, Lucan","RO,US,IE,GR,IT",2,"Romania,United States,Ireland,Greece,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Another great caufethat precipitates the downfal of every fine art is defpotifra. The reafon is obvious; and there is a difrtial example of it in Rome, particularly with regard to eloquence. We learn from a dialogue accounting for the corruption of the Roman eloquence, that in the decline of the art it became fafhionable to fluff harangues with impertinent poetical quotations, without any view but ornament merely ; and this alfo was long fafhionabR in France.

"He honoured men of learning, admitted them to his table, and was bountiful to them. It would be pain¬ ful to follow the decline of the fine arts in Rome to their total extirpation. The tyrrany of Tiberius, and of fubfequent emperors, broke at laft the elevated and independent fpirit of the brave Romans, reduced them to abjetft flavery, and left not a fpark of genius. The feieneexjf law is the only exception, as it flourifhed even in the worft of times : the Roman lawyers were a re- fpedlable body, and lefs the object of jeaioufy than men of power and extenfive landed property. Among the Greeks alfo, a conquered people, the fine arts decayed ; but not fo rapidly as at Rome; the Greeks, farther removed from the feat of government, being lefs within the reach of a Roman tyrant. During their depreifion, they were guilty of the moft puerile conceits : witnefs verfes compofed in the form of an ax, an egg, wings, and fuch like.

Lucian is the only exception that may be made","Rome, Roman, Rome, Roman, Adrian","US,RO,GR",2,"United States,Romania,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe"
"We need fcarce any other caufe but defpotifm, to account for the decline of ftatuary and painting in Greece. Thefe arts had arrived at their utmoft per- feftion about the time of Alexander the Great; and from that time they declined gradually with the vigour of a free people ; for Greece was now enflaved by the Macedonian power. It may in general be obferved, that when a nation becomes ftationary in that degree of power which it acquires from its conftitution and fi- tuation, the national fpirit fubfides, and men of talents become rare. It is ftill worfe with a nation that is funk below its former power and pre-eminence; and worft of all when it is reduced to flavery. Other caufes concurred to accelerate the downfal of the arts men¬ tioned. Greece, in the days of Alexander, was filled with ftatuesof excellent workmanftiip; and there being little demand for more, the later ftatuaries were re¬ duced to heads and bufts. At laft; the Romans put a total end both to ftatuary and painting in Greece, by plundering it of its fineft pieces; and the Greeks, ex- pofed to the avarice of the conquerors, bellowed no longer any money on the fine arts",,"GR,MK",2,"Greece,North Macedonia","Europe,Europe"
"The fame caufe would have been fatal to the arts of ftatuary and painting among the Greeks, even though they had continued a free people. The decay of paint¬ ing in modern Italy is, probably, owing to the fame caufe: Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, &c. are lofty oaks that bear down young plants in their neigh¬ bourhood, and intercept from them the funfhine, of e- mulation.

"Culture. The garden afparagus is with great care cultivated for the ufe of the table. The propagation of this ufeful plant is from feed; and as much of the fuccefs depends upon the goodnefs of the feed, it is much better to fave it than to buy it at the {hops. The manner of faving it is this: Mark with a flick fome of the faireft buds; and when they are run to berry, and the ftalks begin to dry and wither, cut them up; rub off the berries into atub, and, pouring waterupon them, rub them about with your hands; the hufles will break and let out the feed, and will fwim away with the water in pouring it off; fo that in repeating this two or three times, the feeds will be clean waflied, and found at the bottom of the tub. Thefe muft be fpread on a mat to dry, and in the beginning of February muft be fown on a bed of rich earth. They muft not be fown too thick, and muft be trod into the ground, and the earth raked over them fmooth : the bed is to be kept clear of weeds all the fummer; and in Odlober, when the {talks are withered and dry, a little rotten dung muft be fpread half an inch thick over the whole furface of the bed. The fpring following, the plants will be fit to plant out for good ; the ground muft; therefore be prepared for them by trenching it well, and burying a large quantity of rotten dung in the trenches, fo that it may lie at leaft fix inches below the furface of the ground: when this is done, level the whole plot exactly, taking out all the loofe {tones. This is to be done juft at the time when the afparagus is to be plant¬ ed out; which muft be in the beginning of March, if the foil is dry, and the feafon forward ; but in a wet foil, it is better to wait till the beginning of April, which is about the feafon that the plants are begin¬ ning ASP [ 733 ] ASP Afparagiis. ning to flioot. The feafon being now come, the roots muft be carefully taken up with a narrow-pronged dung-fork, {baking them out of the earth, feparating them from each other, and obferving to lay all their heads even, for the more convenient planting them, which muft be done in this manner. Lines muft be drawn, at a foot diftance each, ftraight acrofs the bed; thefe muft be dug into fmall trenches of fix inches deep, into which the roots muft be laid, placing them againft the fides of the trench with their buds in a right pofi- tion upwards, and fo that, when the earth is raked over them, they may be two inches under the furface of the ground. Between every four rows a fpace of two feet and a half fliould be left for walking in, to cut the afparagus. When the afparagus is thus plant¬ ed, a crop of onions may be fown on the ground, which will not at all hurt it. A month after this, the afpara¬ gus will come up, when the crop of onions muft be thinned, and the weeds carefully cleared away. About Auguft the onions will be fit to pull up. In Odtober following, cut off the ftioots of the afparagus within two inches of the ground, clear well all weeds away, and throw up the earth upon the beds, fo as to leave them five inches above the level of the alleys. A row of colworts may be planted in the middle of the alleys, but nothing muft be now fown on the beds. In the fpring the weeds muft be hoed up, and all the fummer the beds kept clear of weeds. In October they muft be turned up, and earthed again, as the preceding fea¬ fon. The fecond fpring after planting, feme of the young afparagus may be cut for the table. The larger {hoots {hould only be taken, and thefe ftiould be cut at two inches under ground, and the beds every year ma¬ naged as in the fecond year. But as fome people are very fond of early afparagus, the following directions are given by which it may be obtained anytime in winter: Plant fome good roots at one year old in a moift rich foil, about eight inches apart; the fecond and third years after planting, they will be ready to take up for the hot-beds ; thefe {hould be made pretty ftrong, a- bout three feet thick, with new ftable-dung that has fermented a week or more ; the beds muft be covered with earth fix inches thick; then againft a ridge made at one end, begin to lay in your plants, without trim¬ ming or cutting the fibres, and between every row lay a little ridge of fine earth, and proceed thus till the bed is planted ; then cover the bed two inches thick with earth, and encompafs it with a ftraw-band, and in a week, or as the bed is in the temper, put on the frames and glaffes, and lay on three inches thick of freftt earth over the beds, and give them air and add frefti heat to them as it requires.

The thick and folid afphalta are at prefent employed in Egypt, Arabia, and Perfia, as pitch for {hips ; as the fluid ones, for burning in lamps, and for varnifties. Some writers relate, that the walls of Ba¬ bylon, and the temple of Jerufalem, were cemented with bitumen inftead of mortar. Thus much is cer¬ tain, that a true natural bitumen, that for inftance which is found in the diftri6t of Neufchatel, proves an excellent cement for walls, pavements, and other pur- pofes, uncommonly firm, very durable in the air, and not penetrable by water.
