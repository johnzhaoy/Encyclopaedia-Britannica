"In the year 1705, he publifhed an account of his tra¬ vels, dedicated to lord Somers; which, though at firft but indifferently received, yet in a little time met with its deferved applaufe. In the year 1702, he was about to return to England, when he received advice of his being appointed to attend prince Eugene, who then commanded for the emperor in Italy : but the death of king William happening foon after, put an Add end to this affair as well as his penfion ; and he re- mained for a confiderable time unemployed. But an unexpedled incident at once raifed him, and gave him an opportunity of exerting his fine talents to advan¬ tage : for in the year 1704, the lord-treafurer Godol- phin happened to complain to lord Halifax, that the duke of Marlborough’s vi&ory at Blenheim had not been celebrated in verfe in the manner it deferved ; and intimated, that he would take it kindly, if his lordffiip, who was the known patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of doing juftice to fo elevated a fubjedl. Lord Halifax replied, fomewhat haftily, that he did know fuch a perfon, but would not mention him ; adding, that long had he feen, with indignation, men of no merit maintained in luxury at the public expence^ whilft thofe of real worth and mo¬ defty were fuffered to languiffi in obfeurity. The treasurer anfwered very coolly, that he was forry there ffiould be occafion for fuch an obfervation, but that he would do his endeavour to wipe off fuch reproaches for the future ; and he engaged his honour, that whoever his lordffiip'named, as a perfon capable of celebrating this viftory, ffiould meet with a fuitable recompence","Eugene, Halifax, Marlborough, Blenheim","US,IT,GB,NZ",2,"United States,Italy,United Kingdom,New Zealand","North America,Europe,Europe,Oceania"

"We fhall conclude this fubjeft with fome obfervations made by Mr Forfter, on the climate of different places in the fouthern hemifphere. The following is an ac- ii 'Climate of count of the climate of New Zealand in Novr. 1773.— I Kew Zea- « Scarce a day paffed without heavy fqualls of wind, II and' which hunied down with redoubled velocity from the mountains; and ftrongfhowers of rain, which retarded all our occupations. The air commonly was cold and raw, vegetation made flow advances, and the birds were only found in the valleys flickered from the chilling fouthern blaft. This kind of weather, in all likelihood, prevails throughout the winter ; and likewife, far into the middle of fummer, without a much greater degree of cold in the former, or of warmth in the latter feafon",,NZ,2,New Zealand,Oceania
"[ 293 ] A M E make the climate able difference of fite, will naturally n infinitely milder than that of Falkland’s Iflands, but cannot affefl: the general hypothefis concerning the tem¬ perature of all iflands; and the immenfe height of the mountains in New Zealand, fome of which are covered with fnow throughout the year, doubtlefs contributes to refrigerate the air, fo as to aflimilate it to that of the Falkland’s Ifles, which are not fo high.” Tierra del Fuego, the fouthem extremity of Ame-^'5ena rica, is thus defcribed. “ On the 2d of December 1774, after a fliort calm, we had a frertr breeze, which con¬ tinued to blow without intermiffion, but with different degrees of velocity, till the 18th, when we made the land, a little after midnight, near Cape Defeado, on one of the weftermoft iflands of Tierra del Fuego. The part of the world which was now in fight, had a very unfavourable afpe6t. About 3 o’clock in the morning, we ran along it, and found it for the greateft part hid in a thick haze. The parts near us feemed to be fmali iflands, which, though not very high, were, however, very black, and almoft entirely barren. Beyond them we faw fome broken high lands, which were covered, with fnow, almoft to the water’s edge.—In the after¬ noon, we paffed the ifland upon which cape Noir is fi- tuated, mentioned by M. Frezier.—We found many feparate iflands, from the place where we made the coaft, to Cape Noir; and fhould perhaps have feen many more, if the weather had not been very hazy",,NZ,2,New Zealand,Oceania
"Nevetthelefs we are not to imagine, that either of thefe axe fpecific differences; feeing the Laplanders and Hun- lingnefs to kill and eat them. But it is owing to the time we fpend on the education of dogs, that they ac¬ quire thofe eminent qualities which attach them fo much to us. The natural qualities of our dogs may receive a wonderful improvement; but education muft give its affiftance, without which the human mind itfelf, though, capable of an iramenfe expanfion, remains in a very con- trafted A M E [ 3°5 ] A M E difpofition. Education may perhaps likewife graft new inftinfts: the New Zealand dogs are fed on the re¬ mains of their matter’s meals; they eat the bones of o- ther dogs; and the puppies become true canibals from their birth. We had a young New Zealand puppy on board, which had certainly had no opportunity of tatt¬ ing any thing but the mother’s milk before we pur- chafed it: however, it eagerly devoured a portion of the tra&ed ftate.
