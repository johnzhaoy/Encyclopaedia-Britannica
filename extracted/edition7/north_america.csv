"Many French names have Le, La, De, Des, or Dm, prefixed to them; as Le Clerc, La Harpe, La Place, De Moivre, Du Halde, Des Cartes. Sometimes both words are thrown into one ; as Laplace, Lagrange. It is 11 a question whether, in such cases, the initial letter of the prefix, or that of the distinctive word, ought to determine the position of the name in the Index. Except where both words are usually joined, no general rule has been strictly adhered to in the body of the work; for the most part, however, the prefix has been disregarded so that Du Halde, for example, appears under the letter H, and Le Clerc under the letter C. In compiling the Index, the following principle has been adopted :—Where a name is commonly printed as two words (Le Clerc, for in¬ stance), the latter determines its place in the Index; while in such cases as Laplace, Descartes, &c., the former is followed. It may be well, however, for the reader to look at both places when any doubt is entertained","Laplace, Laplace",US,7,United States,North America
