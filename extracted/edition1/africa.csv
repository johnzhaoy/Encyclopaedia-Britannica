"Linnaeus, then, firlt attempts to Ihow, that vegetables are endowed with a certain degree of animal life; and, fecbndly, that they propagate their fpecies in a, manner limilar to that of animals. , “ That vegetables are really animated beings,” fays he, “ mull be obvious at firft fight; becaufe they pof- fefs all the properties contained in thaLaccurate definition of life laid down by the great Dr Harvey, namely, Pita eji fporttanea propulfio humorum. But univerfal experi¬ ence teaches, that vegetables propel humours or juices : Hence it is plain that vegetables mull be endowed with a certain degrees of animal life.” Not trufting*folely to a fyllogifin founded on a defini¬ tion, Linnseus proceeds to fupport the life of vegetables by arguments drawn from the following particulars in their oeconomy; the firlt of which he intitles “ Nutritio.—The very idea of nutrition implies a propulfion of humours, and, of courfe, the idea of life",Pita,GN,1,Guinea,Africa
"We come now to the culture of the palm-tree, which is the fixth and mo/l plaufible argument employed by the fexuali/ls. Herodotus, Theophra/lus, Pliny, and fome others, have informed us, that the female palm-tree, unlefs ANY. 647 a male grows fu/fieiently near it, or unlefs the pollen be artificially conveyed to the female fpatha, will produce nothing but four dates and unfertile feeds. This fad is partly denied by Pere-Labat and Tournefort. The for¬ mer of thefe authors exprefsly affirms, that a female palm- tree, in the garden belonging to the mona/lery at Mar- tinico, produced mo/l excellent fruit, although there was not a male within fix miles of it : From which he con¬ cludes, that the prefence of the male is not neceffary to render this tree fruitful, whatever may be pretended by ancient or modern naturali/ls. Herodotus relates, th«' the people of Babylon, when the male was at too great a di/lance from the female, made a rope pafs from the boughs of the one to the boughs of the other, to afford an opportunity to the culices and other infecls to pafs along the rope, and convey fome kind of impregnating influence from the male to the female. Tournefort, wiien he was in that country, inquired at the mo/l in¬ telligent people of the place, as to the truth of this re¬ lation ; but received for anfwer, That they had never heard of any fuch matter. Even the favourers of the fexual hypothefis give very different accounts of the me¬ thod of cultivating palm-trees in thofe countries. Vef- lingius, who refided many years in Egypt, denies that any artificial method is employed for frudlifying the palm-trees in that country. Thus Yeflingius exprefsly contradidls Herodotus and many others. In a word, ai- mo/l every different author gives a different account of this /lory. Amid/l fo many contradidlions concerning the culture of palm-trees, the oppofers of the fexes conclude, that the whole /lory is a vular error, taken for granted by fome learned men, fpurioufly fathered upon others, and fwallowed down without examination by their cre¬ dulous readers.—As we have not feen any anfwer to Mylefius’s letter on this fubjecl, our obfervations upon it /hall be reffrved till this bi/lorical view of the contro- verfy be finiffied",,EG,1,Egypt,Africa
