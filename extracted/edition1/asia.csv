"ACADEMICS, or Acabemists, a denomination gi¬ ven to the cultivators of a fpecies of philofophy oiigk* eally derived from Sornates; aid afottwaids iliuflrsied Von. I. No i. 3 ) A C A and inforoedby Plato, who taught in a grove near A- thens, confecrated to the memory of Academus an A- thenian hero; from which circumffance this philofophy received the name of academical. Before the days of Plato, philofophy had, in a great meafure, fallen into contempt. The conttadidory fyfleitis and hypothefes that had fuccellively been urged upon the world, Were become fo numerous, that, from a view of this ineon- ftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal feeptieifm was the natural confequeftce of this conciufion. In otder to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the hufnan Faculties, Plato laid hold of the principles of th’e aca¬ demical philofophy, and, in his Phaedo, reafonS m the following manner: “ If we ate unable to difeover “ truth, (fays he), it mnft be owing to two circtam- “ (lances; either there is no truth in the nature df “ things, or the mind, from a defed in its powers, “ is not able to apprehend it. Upon the latter luppo- “ (ition, all the uncertainly and fiuduation in the opi- “ nions and judgments of mankind admit of an eafy “ folution: Let us therefore be model!, and afefibe “ our errors to the real weaknefs of our own rnirtds, “ and not to the nature of things tbremfelves. Truth “ is often difficult of acoefs: in order to come at ir, rt We mull proceed with camion and diffidence, care- *c fully examining every ftep ; and after all cur labdur, “ we will frequently find our greateft efforts difap- “ pointed, and be obliged to confefs Our ignorance “ and weaknefs.” Labour and caution in our refearcb.es, in oppofitioh to raffi and hafty decifions, were the diftinguifhing charac- teriftics of the difciples of the. anoient academy. A philofophcr pofTeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrefs, but will fjridom fall into errors, or have occalion to alter his opinion after it is once form¬ ed. Vanity and precipitance are the great fourccs’of fcepticifm : hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plun¬ ged themfclves into ah abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcep¬ ticifm. They pretend to diferedit things that are plain, fimple, and eafily comprehended; but give peremptory and decifive judgments upon fubjetfs that evidently ex¬ ceed the limits of oor capacity. Of thefe Berkley ifnd Hume are the mod confiderable. Berkley denied the exigence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a (lep further, and quediohed even the CxiftenCe of ideas; but at the fame time has not htfi- tated to give determined opinions with regard to etfer- mty, providence, and a future (late, miraculous inttr- politions of the Deity, <bc. fubjedh far above the reach of our faculties. In his feffay on the academical or fceptical philofophy, he has confounded two vdry oppofite fpecies of pirilofephy. After the days :of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firfl academy weie grofsly corrupted by Arcefrlas, Carneades, &c.

"If the whole fcience of botany were as complete as fome of its branches, very little llcill in it would be fuf- ficient to guard us infallibly from committing fuch fatal miftakes. There are certain orders and clafles which ' are called natural, bycaufe every genus and fpecies com¬ prehended under them are not only diftinguilhed by the fame charaderiftic marks, but likewife poflefs the fame qualities, though not all in an equal degree. Forex- ample : Shew a botanift the flower of a plant whofe calix is a double-valved glume, with three ftamina, two pi- ftils, and one naked feed, he can pronounce with abio- lute certainty, that the plant from which the flower was taken bears feeds of a farinaceous quality, and that they may be fafely ufed as food. In like manner, ftiew him a flower with twelve or more ftamina, ail inferted into the internal fide of the calix; though it belonged to a plant growing in Japan, he can pronounce, without hefi- tation, that the fruit of it may be eat with fafety. On the other hand, (how him a plant whofe flower has five ftamina, one piftil, one petal or flower-leaf, and whofe fruit is of the berry kind, he will tell you to abftainfrom eating it, becaufe it is poifonous. Many other examples might be given: but we ftiail referve them till we come to the medical qualities",,JP,1,Japan,Asia

"It is the bufinefs of the praAitioner to have a general ac¬ quaintance with thefe, and to preferibe them according to the cuftom of the times.

When¬ ever any fcience is converted into a trade, and the ftudy of it confined to people who muft live by it, there is little profpeA of improvement. This has been the fate of phy¬ fic.

"It is admitted by Pontedera, Dr Alfton, fyc. that fome of the acients applied the terms male and female to feveral plants. But then they deny that thefe terms con¬ veyed the fame ideas to the ancients that they do to the moderns. Male and female, when applied to plants, were to the ancients mere terms of diftindtion, ferving only as trivial names to diftinguiffi one fpecies or variety from another.

"For, by the analogy of all animals, nay, taking our ana¬ logy from Linnaeus’s vegetable mules, this fortuitous impregnation ffiould have only produced a mule, or mix¬ ture of the two fpecies, and not a perfett metamorphofis of either. Hence it may be fairly concluded, that this fa¬ mous ftory, upon which the fexualifts lay fo much ftrefs, inftead of ftrengthening, tends to the final deftruttion of that hypothefis in fapport of which it was originally ad¬ duced.’ ' Of a fimilar nature is the ftory contained in Mylius’s Ifetter to Dr Watfon. This gentleman writes to his cor- refpondent, “ that a female palm, tree grew many years in the garden belonging to the Royal Academy at Berlih, without producing any ripe or fertile fruit; that a male, branch, with its flowers in full blow, was brought from Leipfic, which is about twenty German miles from Ber¬ lin, and . fufpended over the female; the refult of this operation was, that the female, that very year, produced Foo ripe and fertile fruit. The fame experiment being repeated the following year, 2000 ripe fruit were pro- A N Y. 6s z dueed.” — Not to call Mylius’s veracity in queftien, we ffiall allow the fatt to be as he has related it: Ne- verthelefs it is far from being fatisfattory. Berlin is not the native climate of palm-trees. Mylius in¬ forms us, that this palm bore flowers and fruit for thirty years before the experiment was tried ; but the fruit never came to full maturity. Now it is well known, that many exotic plants, particularly thole of the larger kinds,, feldom produce ripe fruit in a climate which is^ not adapted by nature for their nourifhment, unlefs they are aflifted by artificial culture, and have grown in that cli¬ mate for a great number of years.
