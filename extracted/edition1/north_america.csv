They had recouife to aether, occult qualities, and other imaginary cables, in order to ex¬ plain the various phaenomena of nature: But fihee the days of the great Lord Verulam, who may be ftyled the parent of genuine philofophy, a contrary courfe has happily been followed.

Since his time, the belt philofbphers have followed the trait Vhich he pointed out.

Even Sir Ifaac Newton himfelf was not proof againft this temptation. It was not enough that he had difeovered the nature of light and colours, the application of gra¬ vity to the motions of the heavenly bodies, 6c. he muft go further, and attempt to ailign the caufe of gravity, it- ielf.

"However, upon the authority of this dilemma., the au¬ thor fird gives what he calls a Corapend of a new doc¬ trine concerning the nerves, and then proceeds to inquire in what manner the nerves produce animal heat: He tells us,44 That thought [c-ogitatio) and fenfation depend 44 uponimpulfes either on the extremities of the nerves, 44 or the fenforium commune, and the confequent mo- 44 tions produced by thefe impulfes: That thefe motions are fo quick, as to be almod indantaneous: That as 44 all motion is mechanical; therefore thought, fen- 44 fation, and mufcular motion, mud likewife be me- 44 chanical: That fuch quick motions cannot be p.ro- 44 duced without the intervention of fome extreme- 44 ly eladic power; and, as Sir Ifaac Newton has 44 fhown, that the impulfes which occafion the diffe- 44 rent fenfations mud be owing to an elaflic power; 44 therefore the mufcular motions of animals mud be 44 occafioned by the ofcillations offome eladic power.” 44 But,” fays he, 44 as this eladic power cannot ex- 44 id in the folid nervous fibres, nor in any ineladic “ fluid; therefore, by dilemma, it mud exid in an 44 eladic fluid; and hence alfo, by the former dilemma, 44 this eladic fluid mud be feated, either in the nerves, C4 or in their medullary fubdance,” ) M T H Here again the'author calls Sir Ifaac into his aflid- ance.—44 What confirms this opinion,” fays he, 44 is 44 the Newtonian aether, which pervades all nature, 44 and which, with a few variations in its modification, 44 Sir Ifaac has Ihown to be the caufe of cohefion, e- ladicity, gravity, eledlricity, magnetifm, &c. in 44 the following manner: 1. As the rays of light, 44 when refiefted, do not touch the folid parts of bo- 44 dies, but are reflefted a little before they reach 44 them, it is plain that the aether not only fills the 44 pores of bodies, but likewife floats upon their fur- 44 faces ; and hence it becomes the caufe of attradlion 44 andrepulfion.— 2. All metals, and ineladic fluids, 44 are non-ele&rics ; on the other hand, all folid bo- 44 dies, metals excepted, are eleftrics, i. e. proper for 44 accumulating aether. But aether, thus accumulated 44 in fuch a variety of bodies, may produce various 44 motions in the parts of thefe bodies, without indu- 44 cing any change in the bodies themfelves. Hence 44 aether, with fome variations in its modification, is 44 fufficient to account for all the phaenomena of elec- 44 tricity. 3. As iron, by accumulating aether around 44 it, exhibits all the wonders -of magnetifm ; fo this 44 magnetical aether is more analogous to the nervous 44 aether of animals than any-other kind of it. For, 44 as the magnetical aether paffes along iron without 44 changing any part of the iron ; fo the nervous aether, 44 in like manner, paffes along the medullary fubdance 44 of the nerves, and excites motion in any part; that is 44 continuous with them, without inducing any change 44 in the nerves.— 4. The irritability and life of 44 plants, which very much refemble thofe in animals, 44 cannot be explained by any ineladic caufe, and 44 mud therefore be attributed to an astherial one",Newton,US,1,United States,North America

"Fird, then, Linnaeus’s reafoning is of a mixt nature, partly analogical, partly founded* on obfervation. He iets out with an attempt to prove, that plants are en¬ dowed with a certain degree of animal life; and his fun¬ damental reafnn is, becaufe, agreeable to Dr Harvey’s definition of life, they fpmiancoujly propel humours.— Strange, that a man of Linnaeus’s capacity, or indeed of any capacity at all. (hould ferioufly employ an argument pregnant with every degree of abfurdity !—Stranger dill that he (hould take up near twenty pages in illudrating and drawing conclufions from fuch an argument!—If Harvey has given a vague and unintelligible definition of life, can that be a fufficient excufe for laying hold of fuch a definition in order to fortify an undable hypothe¬ fis ? But, were'Harvey’s definition more accurate than it is, and were vegetables adtually poflelfed of living powers, it is eafy to conceive how the life of vegetables might be a proper ted of, or contradiction to, the received de¬ finition : But, how a definition, which, from the com plex and intricate nature of the fubjeCt defined, mud neceflarily be vague and precarious can be employed in confirmation of any general theory, exceeds the powers of common apprehenfion","Harvey, Harvey",US,1,United States,North America
"However, allowing a fponlaneous propulfton of hu¬ mours to be a pe'rfeft definition of life, philologifts are Far from being agreed* with regard to the propriety of Harvey’s fecond maxim. Omne vivum ex ovo may be ■be applied to a great variety of animals. But to this day it remains a very doubtful point, whether man and moft quadrupedes derive their exiftence from the fame fource. Hence the impropriety of drawing an analogy from a property not univerfal even among the animal cre¬ ation in order to fupport an imaginary one among the ve¬ getable tribes",Harvey,US,1,United States,North America
"The firft hint of mules Was taken from a* plant the fi¬ gure and difpofition of wh.ofe leaves, &c. rei'embled the antirrhinum linaria, or common yellow toad-flax ; but attended with this peculiarity, that its parts of frudtifica- tion were entirely diffimilar. Linnaeus, when the plant was firft prefen ted. to. him, imagined it to he fume kind SB of 650 B O T of deception. But, after a more accurate examination, the notion of a fj>urious iflue opportunely came to his aid. The thought pleafed him on a double account: It had a direct tendency to corroborate his favourite hypo- thelis, and laid the foundation of another ftill more ex¬ travagant. Now, thinks he, by this ineftimable difco- very, we Ihall be enabled to take a dry and rigid plant from the mountain’s top, make it copulate with a moift and fpungy aquatic, and their offspring will participate of the rigidity and hardnefs of the former, together with the moifture arid flaccidity of the latter; and hence mankind fhall foon be blefled with an eafy purchafe of their united virtues when flourifliing in the intermediate vale ! More wonderful ftill, we fhall caufe the plants which dwell upon the frozen mountains of Greenland to intermarry with the more delicate and wayward inhabi¬ tants of the torrid zone, and the conftitutions of their children fhall be fo moulded and attempered, that they will live moft comfortably in every temperate clime!— Not contented with extracting two theories out of this iingle plant, Linnaeus forms a third ftill more wild and fantaftical: “ From this curious phenomenon,” fays he, “ it is natural to think, that only two fpecies of each genus exifted ab origins, and that all the variety of fpe¬ cies which now appear are only the fpan of fortuitous commixtures !” If either the fortuitous or artificial copulation of two different fpecies were capable of producing a third per¬ fectly diftinCt from the other two, the number of fpecies would be infinite. According to our author, every blaft of wind, every butterfly, would daily produce hundreds of new fpecies. Neither the gardener nor hufbandman could purchafe feeds with fafety, unlefs they cotild difco- ver, from inipeCfion, whether they had been impregnated by the femen of the fame, or of a different fpecies. Lin naeus would have us to believe, not only that different fpecies of the fame genus copulate together, but even that genera belonging to different claffes engender, and beget mules. For example, he makes the poterium hy- bridum a begot by the agrimonia eupatoria the poterium fanguiforba. The agrimonia belongs to the do- decandria digynia clafs, and the poterium to the moncecia polyandria. Now, let any man ferioufly confider the un¬ avoidable confequences that would follow on the fuppofi- tion that this wanton proftitution of fexes really exifted a- mong vegetables In the firft place, it would be impofi- fible to reduce botany to any regular fyftem ; for every feafon would produce fuch a troop of new and ftrange plants, as would confound every fcheme or method of claffification that ever was, or ever will be invented. A botanift, for inftance, carefully collects and preferves the f^eds of the poterium, in order to raife that plant next feafon; but, after fowing the feeds, to bis utter afto- mfhment, not a Angle poterium appears, but every one of them is metamorphofed into a fpecies of agrimonia, a plant fo totally different that it cannot even be arranged under the fame clafs. ' adly, Linnasus is obliged to con- fiefs, that his vegetable mules, are not fubjeCted to that perverfe law of nature, which cruelly prevents animal mules from propagating their fpecies. On the contraty, lus vegetable.mules enjoy all the, fweets of mutual em- A N Y",,GL,1,Greenland,North America
