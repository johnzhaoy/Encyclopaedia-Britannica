"ACADEMICS, or Acabemists, a denomination gi¬ ven to the cultivators of a fpecies of philofophy oiigk* eally derived from Sornates; aid afottwaids iliuflrsied Von. I. No i. 3 ) A C A and inforoedby Plato, who taught in a grove near A- thens, confecrated to the memory of Academus an A- thenian hero; from which circumffance this philofophy received the name of academical. Before the days of Plato, philofophy had, in a great meafure, fallen into contempt. The conttadidory fyfleitis and hypothefes that had fuccellively been urged upon the world, Were become fo numerous, that, from a view of this ineon- ftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal feeptieifm was the natural confequeftce of this conciufion. In otder to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the hufnan Faculties, Plato laid hold of the principles of th’e aca¬ demical philofophy, and, in his Phaedo, reafonS m the following manner: “ If we ate unable to difeover “ truth, (fays he), it mnft be owing to two circtam- “ (lances; either there is no truth in the nature df “ things, or the mind, from a defed in its powers, “ is not able to apprehend it. Upon the latter luppo- “ (ition, all the uncertainly and fiuduation in the opi- “ nions and judgments of mankind admit of an eafy “ folution: Let us therefore be model!, and afefibe “ our errors to the real weaknefs of our own rnirtds, “ and not to the nature of things tbremfelves. Truth “ is often difficult of acoefs: in order to come at ir, rt We mull proceed with camion and diffidence, care- *c fully examining every ftep ; and after all cur labdur, “ we will frequently find our greateft efforts difap- “ pointed, and be obliged to confefs Our ignorance “ and weaknefs.” Labour and caution in our refearcb.es, in oppofitioh to raffi and hafty decifions, were the diftinguifhing charac- teriftics of the difciples of the. anoient academy. A philofophcr pofTeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrefs, but will fjridom fall into errors, or have occalion to alter his opinion after it is once form¬ ed. Vanity and precipitance are the great fourccs’of fcepticifm : hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plun¬ ged themfclves into ah abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcep¬ ticifm. They pretend to diferedit things that are plain, fimple, and eafily comprehended; but give peremptory and decifive judgments upon fubjetfs that evidently ex¬ ceed the limits of oor capacity. Of thefe Berkley ifnd Hume are the mod confiderable. Berkley denied the exigence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a (lep further, and quediohed even the CxiftenCe of ideas; but at the fame time has not htfi- tated to give determined opinions with regard to etfer- mty, providence, and a future (late, miraculous inttr- politions of the Deity, <bc. fubjedh far above the reach of our faculties. In his feffay on the academical or fceptical philofophy, he has confounded two vdry oppofite fpecies of pirilofephy. After the days :of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firfl academy weie grofsly corrupted by Arcefrlas, Carneades, &c. This might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the etcade- Tuical and fceptical philofophy were fynrouimous ternis","Plato, Plato, Plato, Of, Plato","CO,TR",1,"Colombia,Turkey","South America,Asia"

"ACADEMY, in antiquity, a garden or villa, fituated within a mile of Athens, where Plato and his follow¬ ers held their philofophical conferences.

Cimon embellilhed it with fountains, trees, and walks ; but Sylla, during the liege of Athens, employed thefe very trees in making battering-engines againft the city.
