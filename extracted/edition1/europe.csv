The full moon being al¬ ways oppofite to the fun, can never be feen while the fun is above the horizon, except when the moon falls in the northern half of her orbit; for whenever any point of the ecliptic rifes, the oppofite point fets. Therefore, as the fun is above the horizon of the north pole from the 20th of March till the 23d of September, it is plain, that the moon, when full, being oppofite to the fun, muft be below the horizon during that half of the year. But when the fun is in the fouthern half of the ecliptic, he never rifes to the north pole, during which half of the year, every full moon happens in fome part of the north¬ ern half of the ecliptic, which never fets.

"We * There are two ancient ecllpfes of the moon, recorded by Ptolemy from Hipparchus, which afford an undent- able proof of the moon's acceleration.

That year correfponds to the 585th year before Chrift ; when accordingly there happened a very dgnal eclipfe of the fun, on the 28th of May, anfwering to the prefent 10th of that month, cen¬ tral through North America, the fouth parts of France, Italy, fee. as far as Athens, or the ides in the Aegean fea ; which is the fartheft that even the Caroline tables carry it; and confequently make it invifible to any part of Afia^ in the total charafter ; though there are good rea- fons to believe that it extended to Babylon, and went down central over that city. We are not however to imagine, that it was fet before it pad Sardis and the Afiatic towns, where the predidlor lived ; becaufe an in- vilible eclipfe could have been of no fervice to demon- ilrate his ability in aftronomical fciences to his country¬ men, as it could give no proof of its reality; For a farther illudration, Thucydides relates, That a folar eclipfe happened on a fummer’s day in the after¬ noon, in the firft year of the Peloponnedan war, fo great, that the ftars appeared. Rhodius was viftor in the Olympic games the fourth year of the faid war, be¬ ing alfo the fourth of the 87 th Olympiad, on the 428th year before Chrift.

"The divifion of the fcriptures into chapters, as we at prefent have them, is of much later date. Some attri¬ bute it to Stephen Langton, archbilhop of Canterbury, in the reigns of John and Henry III. But the true au¬ thor of the invention was Hugo de Sandto Caro, com¬ monly called Hugo Cardinalis, becaufe he was the firft Dominican that ever was raifed to the degree of cardi¬ nal. This Hugo flourilhed about the year 1240. He wrote a comment on the fcriptures, and projedled the firft concordance, which is that of the vulgar Latin Bi¬ ble. The aim of this work being.for the more eafy find¬ ing out any word or pafiage in the feriptures, he foiind it neceflary to divide the book into fedtions, and the lec¬ tions into fubdivifions ; for till that time the vulgar La¬ tin Bibles were without any divifion at all. Thele fec- tions are the chapters into which the Bible hath ever fince been divided. But the fubdiylfion of, the chanters was not then into verfes. as it is now. Hugo’s method of fubdividingthem was by the letters A; B, C, D, E, F, G, placed in the margin at an equal diftance from each other, according to the length' of the chapters. The fubdivi- fioo ol the chapters into verfes, as they now Hand in our Bibles, had its original from a famous Jewilh rabbi, na¬ med Mordecai Nathan, about the year 1445. This rab¬ bi, in imitation of Hugo Cardinalis, drew up a concord- 6 Y anee 3 B 1 B ( 546 ) BIB ance to the Hebrew Bible, for the ufe of the Jews. But though he followed Hugo in his divifion of the books into chapters, he refined upon his invention as to the fub- divifion, and contrived that by verfes : this being found to be a much more convenient method, it has been ever fince followed. And thus, as the Jews borrowed the divifion of the books of the holy fcriptures into chapters from the Chriftians, in like manner the Chriftians bor¬ rowed that of the chapters into verfes from the Jews",Canterbury,"GB, Do",1,"United Kingdom,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"As the Jews were very backward in having any inter- courfe with drangers, it was a long time before their facred books came to be known and read in other nations. Jo fephus afcribes the little that is faid of the Jews by pa¬ gan writers to this, that the latter had no opportunity of being acquainted with their hidorians, for want of a tranflation of their books into the Greek language. A- rideas indeed pretends, that there was ah imperfeCI ver- don of the fcriptures before the time of Demetrius Pha- Jereus; and that Theopompus intending to infert a part of them in his verfes, was deprived of bis underdanding/, but of this there is no proof.",,GR,1,Greece,Europe

"Before our Saviour’s time, there was no other Greek verfion of the Old Tedament, befides that which went under the name of the Septuagirit: But after the eda- bliffiment of Chridianity, Lome authors undertook new trandations, under pretence, of making them more con¬ formable to the Hebrew text.

"The fecond Greek verfion after the Septuagint is that of Symmachus, a Samaritan by birth, who fird turned Jew, then Chridian, and at lad Ebionite. He compo- fed it, according to Epiphanius, in the reign of the em¬ peror Severus. His verfion was more free than the red; for he applied himfelf chiefly to the fenfe, without tranf- lating word for word; wherefore his verfion comes near¬ er the Septuagint than that of Aquila. The third Greek verfion is that of Theodotion of Ephefus. It is faid he was a difciple of Marcion, and that, having had fome difference with thofe of his feft, he turned Jew. The verfion of this author was the bed of the three, becaufe he kept a jud medium between Aquila and Symmachus#, not confining himfelf fo fervilely to the letter as the firft did, nor wandering fo far from it as the fecond did",,GR,1,Greece,Europe

"This method qfed in the bleaching of our coarfe cloths, is very like that pradtifed in Ireland for both fine and coarfe. The only material difference is, that there the bleachers ufe no other affies but the kelp or caffiub. A lye is drawn from the former by cold water, which dif- folves the falts, and not the fulphureous particles of the kelp affies. This lye is ufed till the cloth is half whi¬ tened, and then they lay afide the kelp-lye for one made of caffiub affies",,IE,1,Ireland,Europe
"“ Againft this do&rine there may be brought two ob- je&ions, feemingly of great weight. It is a general opi¬ nion among/! bleachers, that linen whitens quicker in March and April, than in any other months : But as the evaporation cannot be fo great at that time, as when the fun has a greater heat; hence the whitening of cloth is not in proportion to the degree of evaporation; and therefore the former cannot be owing to the latter. This obje&ion vani/hes, when we confider, that the cloth which comes firft into the bleachfield, in the fpring, is clofely attended, having no other to interfere with it for fome time ; and, as it is the whittft, gets, in the after buck¬ ings, the firft of the lye; while the fecond parcel is’often, bucked with what has been ufed to the firft. Were the fa<ft true, on which the objedion is founded, this would B L E A C be a fuilicient anfwer to the objeftion. But it appears not to be true, from an obfervation of Mr John Chriftie, That doth laid down in the beginning of June, and fi- nifhed in September, takes generally lefs work, and un¬ dergoes fewer operations, than what is laid down in March, and finilhed in June","March, March",GB,1,United Kingdom,Europe
"This mill was invented in Ireland about thirty years ago. The Irifli ble-ichers ufe it for their fine, as well as coarfe cloatb. Thefe rubbing-boards were difcharged, fome years ago, in Ireland, by the Truftees for the ma¬ nufactures of that country, convinced from long expe¬ rience of their bad effects. But as proper'care was not taken to inftruct the bleach rs by degrees in a fafor me¬ thod, they continued in the old, made a party, and kept poffeffion of the rubbing-boards. There were confide¬ rable improvements made in them in this country; fuch as the addition of the ledges, to keep the cloth moift; and of the rollers, which pull the cloth more gradually than mens hands. Thefe improvements were firft made in Salton bleachfield",,IE,1,Ireland,Europe
"The objections againft thefe rubbing-boards, are un¬ anfwerable. By rubbing on fuch an unequal furfaCe, the folid fibrous part of the cloth is wore; by which means it is much thinned, and in a great meafure weakened be¬ fore it comes to the market. As a proof of this, if the water which comes from the cloth in the rubbing-boards be examined, it will be found full of cottony fibrous matter. Thefe boards give the cloth a cottony furface, fo that it does not keep long clean. Again, they flatten the threads, and take away all that roundnefs and firm- nefs, which is the diftinguifhing property of cloth bleached in the Dutch method",,NL,1,Netherlands,Europe
"For thefe reafons they muft be very prejudicial to fine cloth, and fliould never be ufed in bleaching it. As they fe^m to be, in fome meafure, neceffary to leffen the expence of bleaching coarfe linen, they ought never to be ufed above'twice, or thriee at moft. They might be rendered much more fafe, by lining their infides with fome foft elaftic fubftance, that will not wear the cloth fo much as the wooden teeth do.

The flefh of this ferpent is eat by the Indians, and the ne¬ groes of Africa. Pifo, Margraave, and Kempfer give the following account of its method of living and catching its prey. It frequents caves and thick fo- refts, where it conceals itfelf, and foddenly darts out upon travellers, wild hearts, fyc. When it chufes a tree for its watching-place, it fupports itfelf by twill¬ ing its tail around the trunk or a branch, and darts down upon Iheep, goats, tigers, or any animal that comes within its reach. When it lays hold of ani¬ mals, efpecially any of the larger kinds, it twills it¬ felf feveral times round their body, and, by the vaft force of its circular mufcles, bruifes and breaks all their bones. After the bones are broke, it licks the fkin of the animal all over, befmearing it with a glu¬ tinous kind of faliva. This operation is intended to facilitate deglutition, and is a preparation for fwallow- yig the whole animal. If it be a flag, or any horned animal, it begins to fwallow the feet firft, and gradu¬ ally fucks in .the body, and laft of all the head. When the horns happen to be large, this ferpent has been ob- ferved to go about Tor a long time with the horns of a flag fticking out from its mouth. As the animal digerts, the horns putrify and fall off. After this ferpent has fwallowed a flag or a tyger, it is unable for fome days to move ; the hunters, who are well acquainted with this circumftance, always take this opportunity of de- rtroying it. When irritated, it makes a loud hilling noife. This ferpent is Paid to cover itfelf over with leaves in fuch places as flags or other animals frequent, in order to conceal itfelf from their light, and that it may the more ealily lay hold of them. See Plate LII. fig. 1.—ij. The murina, has 254 leuta on the belly, and 65 on the tail. The colour of it is a light blue, with round fpots on the back.

"For, by the analogy of all animals, nay, taking our ana¬ logy from Linnaeus’s vegetable mules, this fortuitous impregnation ffiould have only produced a mule, or mix¬ ture of the two fpecies, and not a perfett metamorphofis of either. Hence it may be fairly concluded, that this fa¬ mous ftory, upon which the fexualifts lay fo much ftrefs, inftead of ftrengthening, tends to the final deftruttion of that hypothefis in fapport of which it was originally ad¬ duced.’ ' Of a fimilar nature is the ftory contained in Mylius’s Ifetter to Dr Watfon. This gentleman writes to his cor- refpondent, “ that a female palm, tree grew many years in the garden belonging to the Royal Academy at Berlih, without producing any ripe or fertile fruit; that a male, branch, with its flowers in full blow, was brought from Leipfic, which is about twenty German miles from Ber¬ lin, and . fufpended over the female; the refult of this operation was, that the female, that very year, produced Foo ripe and fertile fruit. The fame experiment being repeated the following year, 2000 ripe fruit were pro- A N Y. 6s z dueed.” — Not to call Mylius’s veracity in queftien, we ffiall allow the fatt to be as he has related it: Ne- verthelefs it is far from being fatisfattory. Berlin is not the native climate of palm-trees. Mylius in¬ forms us, that this palm bore flowers and fruit for thirty years before the experiment was tried ; but the fruit never came to full maturity. Now it is well known, that many exotic plants, particularly thole of the larger kinds,, feldom produce ripe fruit in a climate which is^ not adapted by nature for their nourifhment, unlefs they are aflifted by artificial culture, and have grown in that cli¬ mate for a great number of years. Mylius’s palm-tree had carried unripe fruit for the fpace of thirty years","Of, Berlin","DE,TR",1,"Germany,Turkey","Europe,Asia"
"Now, according to the ufual courfe of exotics, it is na¬ tural to think that, during all this time, the fruit was every feafon making gradual advances towards perfettion r It might fo fall out, then, that at the very feafon when the male branch was fufpended over the female, the plant had arrived at the higheft degree of perfettion it could ever acquire in the climate of Berlin; and of courfe, the accidental circumftance of fufpending the male, branch over it, at this critical period, might give rife to the deception of attributing the perfettion and fertilization of the fruit to the prefence of the male branch. The cir¬ cumftance of the tree’s bringing forth only 100 ripe fruit the firft year, and 2000 the fecond, remarkably favours this account of the matter",Berlin,DE,1,Germany,Europe

"The figure of the bow is pretty much the fame in all countries, .where it has been,, ufed ; for it has ge¬ nerally two inflexions or bendings, between which, in . the place where the arrow is drawn, is a right line.

The matter of which bows were made, as well as their fize, differed in different countries.
