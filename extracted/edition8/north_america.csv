"This identification of two faculties, so strong¬ ly contrasted in their characteristical features, was least of all to he expected from a logician, who had previously limited the province of Ima¬ gination to the imitation of material objects; a limitation, it may be remarked in passing, which is neither sanctioned by common use, nor by just views of the philosophy of the mind. Upon what ground can it be alleged, that Milton’s portrait of Satan’s intellectual and moral cha¬ racter was not the offspring of the same creative faculty which gave birth to his Garden of Eden ? After such a definition, however, it is difficult to conceive, how so very acute a writer should have referred to Imagination the abstractions of the geometer and of the metaphysician; and still more, that he should have attempted to justify this reference, by observing, that these abstractions do not fall under the cognisance of the senses. My own opinion is, that, in the composition of the whole passage, he had a view to the unexpected parallel between Homer and Archimedes, with which he meant, at the close, to surprise his readers","Milton, Eden",US,8,United States,North America
"After the foregoing observations, it will not he expected that an attempt is to he made, in the following Essay, to solve a problem which has so recently baffled the powers of these eminent writers, and which will probably long continue to exercise the ingenuity of our suc¬ cessors. How much remains to he previously done for the improvement of that part of Logic, whose province it is to fix the limits by which contiguous departments of study are defined and separated! And how many unsuspected affinities may he reasonably presumed to exist among sciences, which, to our circumscribed views, appear at present the most alien from each other ! The abstract geometry of Apol¬ lonius and Archimedes was found, after an in¬ terval of two thousand years, to furnish a torch to the physical inquiries of Newton; while, in the further progress of knowledge, the Etymo¬ logy of Languages has been happily employed to fill up the chasms of Ancient History; and the conclusions of Comparative Anatomy, to il¬ lustrate the Theory of the Earth. For my own part, even if the task were executed with the most complete success, I should be strongly in¬ clined to think, that its appropriate place in an Encyclopaedia would be as a branch of the article on Logic;—certainly not as an exordium to the Preliminary Discourse; the enlarged and re¬ fined views which it necessarily presupposes be¬ ing peculiarly unsuitable to that part of the work which may be expected, in the first instance, to attract the curiosity of every reader",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"In Luther’s Colloquia Mensalia we are told, that “ he abhorred the Schoolmen, and called them sophistical locusts, cater¬ pillars, frogs, and lice.” From the same work we learn, that “ he hated Aristotle, but highly esteemed Cicero, as a wise and a good man.”—See Jortin’s £,i/e of EmswMs, p. 121. _ ..",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"Without this emancipation of the lower or¬ ders, and the gradual diffusion of wealth by which it was accompanied, the advantages de¬ rived from the invention of printing would have been extremely limited. A certain degree of ease and independence is essentially requisite to inspire men with the desire of knowledge, and to afford the leisure necessary for acquiring it; and it is only by the encouragement which such a state of society presents to industry and ambi¬ tion, that the selfish passions of the multitude can be interested in the intellectual improve¬ ment of their children. It is only, too, in such a state of society, that education and books are likely to increase the sum of human happiness; for while these advantages are confined to one privileged description of individuals, they but furnish them with an additional engine for de¬ basing and misleading the minds of their infe¬ riors. To all which it may be added, that it is chiefly by the shock and collision of different and opposite prejudices, that truths are gradually cleared from that admixture of error which they have so strong a tendency to acquire, wherever the course of public opinion is forcibly con- 1 It was in consequence of this mode of conducting education by means of oral instruction alone, that the different sects of philosophy arose in ancient Greece; and it seems to have been with a view of counteracting the obvious inconveniences resulting from them, that Socrates introduced his peculiar method of questioning, with an air of sceptical diffidence, those whom he was anxious to instruct; so as to allow them, in forming their conclusions, the complete and unbiassed exercise of their own reason. Such, at least, is the apology offered for the apparent indecision of the Academic school, by one of its wisest as well as most eloquent adherents. “ As for other sects,” says Cicero, “ who are bound in fetters, before they are able to form any judgment of what is right or true, and who have been led to yield themselves up, in their tender years, to the guidance of some friend, or to the captivating eloquence of the teacher whom they have first heard, they as¬ sume to themselves the right of pronouncing upon questions of which they are completely ignorant; adhering to whatever creed the wind of doctrine may have driven them, as if it were the only rock on which their safety depended.”—Cic",Cicero,"GR,US",8,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"century from the invention of printing, and the fall of the Eastern empire, Copernicus discovered the true theory of the planetary motions, and a very few years afterwards, was succeeded by the three great precursors of Newton,—Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The step made by Copernicus may he justly regarded as one of the proudest triumphs of hu¬ man reason;—whether we consider the sagacity which enabled the author to obviate, to his own satisfaction, the many plausible objections which must have presented themselves against his con¬ clusions, at a period when the theory of motion was so imperfectly understood; or the hold spi¬ rit of inquiry which encouraged him to exercise his private judgment, in opposition to the autho¬ rity of Aristotle,—to the decrees of the church of Rome,—and to the universal belief of the learned, during a long succession of ages. He appears, indeed, to have well merited the enco¬ mium bestowed on him by Kepler, who calls him “ a man of vast genius, and, what is of still greater moment in these researches, a man of a free mind.” The establishment of the Copernican system, beside the new field of study which it opened to Astronomers, must have had great effects on philosophy in all its branches, by inspiring those sanguine prospects of future improvement, which stimulate curiosity, and invigorate the inventive powers. It afforded to the common sense, even of the illiterate, a palpable and incontrovertible proof, that the ancients had not exhausted the stock of possible discoveries; and that, in mat¬ ters of science, the creed of the Romish church was not infallible. In the conclusion of one of Kepler’s works, we perceive the influence of these prospects on his mind. “ Haec et cetera hujusmodi latent in pandectis sevi sequentis, non antea discenda, quam librum hunc Deus arbiter saeculorum recluserit mortalihus.”1 I have hitherto taken no notice of the effects of the revival of letters on Metaphysical, Moral, or Political science. The truth is, that little de¬ serving of our attention occurs in any of these departments prior to the seventeenth century; and nothing which hears the most remote ana¬ logy to the rapid strides made, during the six¬ teenth, in mathematics, astronomy, and physics",Rome,US,8,United States,North America
"“ As late as the year 1598, Daniel Hofman, Professor of Divinity in the University of Helmstadt, laying hold of some particular opinions of Luther, extravagantly maintained, that philosophy was the mortal enemy of religion ; that tiuth was divisible into two branches, the one philosophical and the other theological; and that what was true in philosophy was fa.se in theology.”—Mosheim, Vol. IV. p. 18",University,US,8,United States,North America
"To those who are uninitiated in the mysteries of the conclave, his inference would certainly ap¬ pear much less logical than that of the old Ro¬ man Pagans, who petitioned the Senate to con¬ demn the works of Cicero to the flames, as they predisposed the minds of those who read them for embracing the Christian faith",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"At the same period with Franciscus Patricius, flourished another learned Italian, Albericus Gentilis, whose writings seem to have attracted more notice in England and Germany than in his own country. His attachment to the reform¬ ed faith having driven him from Italy, he sought an asylum at Oxford, where, in 1587, he was ap¬ pointed professor of the Civil Law, an office which he held till the period of his death in 1611.3 He was the author of a treatise De Jure Belli, in three books, which appeared successively in 1588 and 1589, and were first published to¬ gether at Hanau in 1598. His name, however, has already sunk into almost total oblivion; and I should certainly not have mentioned it on the present occasion? were it not for his indisputable merits as the precursor of Grotius, in a depart¬ ment of study which, forty years afterwards, the celebrated treatise De Jure Belli et Pads was 1 His Discussion.es Peripateticoe were printed at Venice in 1571.

"As a specimen of the liberal and moderate views of this philosophical politician, I shall quote two short passages from his Treatise De la Republique, which seem to me objects of con¬ siderable curiosity, when contrasted with the general spirit of the age in which they were written. The first relates to liberty of con¬ science, for which he was a strenuous and in¬ trepid advocate, not only in his publications, but as a member of the Etals Generaux, assembled at Blois in 1576. <£ The mightier that a man is (says Bodin), the more justly and temperate¬ ly he ought to behave himself towards all men, but especially towards his subjects. Wherefore the senate and people of Basil did wisely, who, having renounced the Bishop of Rome’s religion, would not, upon the sudden, thrust the monks and nuns, with the other religious persons, out of their abbeys and monasteries, but only took order, that, as they died they should die both for themselves and their successors, expressly for¬ bidding any new to be chosen in their places, so that, by that means, their colleges might, by 1 “ One cannot help admiring,” says Dr Jortin, “ the decent manner in which the illustrious Thuanus hath spoken ot Calvin “ Acri vir ac vehementi ingenio, et admirabili facundia prseditus; turn inter protestantes magni nominis theolo- gus.”—(Life of Erasmus, p. 555.)

"One of the most extraordinary of these, is his elaborate argument to prove, that, in a w^ell con¬ stituted state, the father should possess the right of life and death over his children ;—a paradox which forms an unaccountable contrast to the general tone of humanity which characterizes his opinions. Of the extent of his credulity on the subject of witchcraft, and of the deep horror with which he regarded those who affected to be sceptical about the reality of that crime, he has left a lasting memorial in a learned and curious volume entitled Demonomanie;5 * * while the ec- 1 Book iv. chap, iii The book from which this quotation is taken was published only twenty-three years after the mur¬ der of Servetus at Geneva ; an event which leaves so deep a stain on the memory not only of Calvin, but on that ot the milder and more charitable Melanchthon. The epistle of the latter to Bullinger, where he applauds the conduct ot the iudges who condemned to the flames this incorrigible heretic, affords the most decisive of all proofs, how remote the senti¬ ments of the most enlightened Fathers of the Reformation were from those Christian and philosophical principles ot tole- ration, to which their noble exertions have gradually, and now almost universally, led the way. , ","Of, Geneva","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"
"“ Novator maximus tempus ; quidni igitur tempus imitemur ?” “ Q,uis novator tempus imitatur, quod novationes ita insinuat, ut sensus fallant ?”—Bacon. _ . . , The Treatise of Bodin De la Republique (by far the most important of his works) was first printed at 1 aris in 7 , am was reprinted seven times in the space of three years. It was translated into Latin by the author himsel ? '¥1 a view chiefly (as is said) to the accommodation of the scholars of England, among whom it was so highly esteemed, t la ec uivs upon it were given in the University of Cambridge, as early as 1580. In 1579, Bodin visited London in the sm e o le Due d’Alencon ; a circumstance which probably contributed not a little to recommend his writings, so very £°on a er eir publication,’to the attention of our countrymen. In 1606, the treatise of The Republic was done inlo English by Kichard Knolles, who appears to have collated the French and Latin copies so carefully and judiciously, that his version is, in some respects, superior to either of the originals. It is from this version, accordingly, that I have transenbed the passages above quoted ; trusting, that it will not be unacceptable to my readers, while looking back to the intellectual attainments o our forefathers, to have an opportunity, at the same time, of marking the progress which had been made in England, moie t tan two centuries ago, in the arts of writing and of translation. _ _ „ at io'i For Dr Johnson’s opinion of Knolles’s merits as an historian, and as an English writer, see the Rambler, ^o. i&s","University, Cambridge, London, Johnson","US,UK,GB,FR",8,"United States,N/A,United Kingdom,France","North America,N/A,Europe,Europe"

"* See the Life of Tycho Brahe, by Gassendi. _ _ 5 I have allotted to Bodin a larger space than may seem due to his literary importance; but the truth is, I know of no political writer, of the same date, whose extensive and various and discriminating reading appears to me to have contri¬ buted more to facilitate and to guide the researches of his successors, or whose references to ancient learning have been more frequently transcribed without acknowledgment. Of late his works have fallen into very general^ neglect; otherwise it is impossible that so many gross mistakes should be current about the scope and spirit of his principles. By many he has been mentioned as a zealot for republican forms of government, probably for no better reason than that he chose to call his book a Treatise De Republica; whereas, in point of fact, he is uniformly a warm and able advocate for monarchy ; and, although no friend to tyranny, has, on more than one occasion, carried his monarchical principles to a very blameable ex¬ cess JSee, in particular, chapters fourth and fifth of the Sixth Book.) On the other hand, Grouvelle, a writer of some note, has classed Bodin with Aristotle, as an advocate for domestic slavery. “ The reasonings of both,” he says, “ are re¬ futed by Montesquieu.” (De VAutorite, de Montesquieu dans la Revolution presente. Paris, 1789.) _ Whoever has the curiosity to compare Bodin and Montesquieu together, will be satisfied, that, on this point, their sentiments were exactly the same; and that, so far from refuting Bodin, Montesquieu has borrowed from him more than one argument in support of his general conclusion. ,","Of, Paris","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"
"The hold and persevering spirit with which Ra¬ mus disputed, in the University of Paris, the authority of Aristotle, and the persecutions he incurred by this philosophical heresy, entitle him to an honourable distinction from the rest of his brethren. He was certainly a man of un¬ common acuteness as well as eloquence, and placed in a very strong light some of the most vulnerable parts of the Aristotelian logic; with¬ out, however, exhibiting any marks of that deep sagacity which afterwards enabled Bacon, Des¬ cartes, and Locke, to strike at the very roots of the system. His copious and not inelegant style as a writer, recommended his innovations to those who were disgusted with the barbarism of the schools;8 while his avowed partiality for the reformed faith (to which he fell a martyr in the massacre of Paris), procured many prose¬ lytes to his opinions in all the Protestant coun¬ tries of Europe. In England his logic had the honour, in an age of comparative light and re¬ finement, to find an expounder and methodiser in the author of Paradise Lost; and in some of our northern universities, where it was very early introduced, it maintained its ground till it was supplanted by the logic of Locke","University, Paris, Paris",US,8,United States,North America

"3 Dr Barrow, in one of his mathematical lectures, speaks of Ramus in terms far too contemptuous. “ Homo, ne quid gravius dicam, argutulus et dicacnlus.""—“ Sane vix indignationi meae tempero, quin ilium accipiam pro suo merito, regeram- que validius in ejus caput, quae contra veteres jactat convicia.” Had Barrow confined this censure to the weak and arro¬ gant attacks made by Ramus upon Euclid (particularly upon Euclid’s definition of Proportion), it would not have been more than Ramus deserved ; but it is evident he meant to extend it also to the more powerful attacks of the same reformer upon the logic of Aristotle. Of these there are many which may be read with profit even in the present times. I select one passage as a specimen, recommending it strongly to the consideration of those logicians who have lately stood forward as advocates for Aristotle’s abecedarian demonstrations of the syllogistic rules. “ In Aristotelis arte, unius pnecepti uni- cum exemplum est, ac ssepissime nullum : sed unico et singular! exemplo non potest artifex effici; pluribus opus est et dissimilibus. Et quidem, ut Aristotelis exempla tantummodo non falsa sint, qualia tamen sunt ? Omne 6 est a : omne c est b : ergo omne c est a. Exemplum Aristotelis est puero a grammaticis et oratoribus venienti, et istam mutorum Mathema- ticorum linguam ignoranti, novum et durum: et in totis Analyticis ista non Attica, non lonica, non Dorica, non vEolica, non communi, sed geometrica lingua usus est Aristoteles, odiosa pueris, ignota populo, a communi sensu remota, a rhetoricse usu et ab humanitatis usu alienissima.”—(P. Rami pro Philosophica Parisiensis Academia; Disciplina Oratio, 1550). If these strictures should be thought too loose and declamatory, the reader may consult the fourth chapter (De Conversionibus) of the seventh Look of Ramus’s Dialectics, where the same charge is urged, in my opinion, with irresistible force of argument","Euclid, Euclid, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"The dialogue of our illustrious countryman Buchanan, De Jure Regni apud Scotos, though occasionally disfigured by the keen and indig¬ nant temper of the writer, and by a predilection (pardonable in a scholar warm from the schools of ancient Greece and Rome) for forms of policy unsuitable to the circumstances of modern Europe, bears, nevertheless, in its general spirit, a closer resemblance to the political philosophy of the eighteenth century, than any composition which had previously appeared. The ethical paradoxes afterwards inculcated by Hobbes as the ground-work of his slavish theory of govern¬ ment, are anticipated and refuted, and a power¬ ful argument is urged against that doctrine of Utility which has attracted so much notice in our times. The political reflections, too, inci¬ dentally introduced by the same author in his History of Scotland, bear marks of a mind worthy of a better age than fell to his lot. Of this kind are the remarks with which he closes his narrative of the wanton cruelties exercised in punishing the murderers of James the First","Buchanan, Rome, Of","GR,LR,US,TR",8,"Greece,Liberia,United States,Turkey","Europe,Africa,North America,Asia"
"BACON.1 The state of science towards the close of the sixteenth century, presented a field of observa¬ tion singularly calculated to attract the curio¬ sity, and to awaken the genius of Bacon; nor was it the least of his personal advantages, that, as the son of one of Queen Elizabeth’s ministers, he had a ready access, wherever he went, to the most enlightened society in Europe. While yet only in the seventeenth year of his age, he was removed by his father from Cambridge to Paris, where it is not to be doubted, that the novelty of the literary scene must have largely contri¬ buted to cherish the natural liberality and inde¬ pendence of his mind. Sir Joshua Reynolds has remarked, in one of his academical Dis¬ courses, that “ every seminary of learning is surrounded with an atmosphere of floating knowledge, where every mind may imbibe some¬ what congenial to its own original concep¬ tions.” * He might have added, with still great¬ er truth, that it is an atmosphere, of which it is more peculiarly salutary for those who have been elsewhere reared to breathe the air. The remark is applicable to higher pursuits than were in the contemplation of this philosophical artist; and it suggests a hint of no inconsider¬ able value for the education of youth","Cambridge, Paris",US,8,United States,North America
"The rapid advancement of intellectual culti¬ vation in England, between the years 1588 and 1640 (a period of almost uninterrupted peace), has been remarked by Mr Fox. “ The general improvement,” he observes, “ in all arts of civil life, and, above all, the astonishing progress of literature, are the most striking among the gene¬ ral features of that period; and are in themselves causes sufficient to produce effects of the utmost importance. A country whose language was en¬ riched by the works of Hooker, Raleigh, and Ba¬ con, could not but experience a sensible change in its manners, and in its style of thinking; and even to speak the same language in which Spen¬ cer and Shakspeare had written, seemed a suf¬ ficient plea to rescue the Commons of England from the appellation of Brutes, with which Hend¬ ry the Eighth had addressed them.”—The re¬ mark is equally just and refined. It is by the mediation of an improving language, that the progress of the mind is chiefly continued from one generation to another ; and that the acquire¬ ments of the enlightened few are insensibly im¬ parted to the many. Whatever tends to diminish the ambiguities of speech, or to fix, with more logical precision, the import of general terms ;— above all, whatever tends to embody, in popular forms of expression, the ideas and feelings of the wise and good, augments the natural powers of the human understanding, and enables the succeeding race to start from a higher ground than was occupied by their fathers. The remark applies with peculiar force to the study of the Mind itself; a study, where the chief source of error is the imperfection of words; and where every improvement on this great instrument of thought may be justly regarded in the light of a discovery.1 In the foregoing list of illustrious names, Mr Fox has, with much propriety, connected those of Bacon and Raleigh; two men, who, not¬ withstanding the diversity of their professional pursuits, and the strong contrast of their cha¬ racters, exhibit, nevertheless, in their capacity of authors, some striking features of resem¬ blance. Both of them owed to the force of their own minds, their emancipation from the fetters of the schools; both were eminently distinguish¬ ed above their contemporaries, by the originality and enlargement of their philosophical views ; and both divide, with the venerable Hooker, the glory of exemplifying, to their yet unpolish¬ ed countrymen, the richness, variety, and grace, which might be lent to the English idiom, by the hand of a master.1' It is not improbable that Mr Fox might have included the name of Hobbes in the same enu¬ meration, had he not been prevented by an aversion to his slavish principles of government, and by his own disrelish for metaphysical theories","Raleigh, Raleigh","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"* To prevent being misunderstood, it is necessary for me to add, that I do not speak of the general style of these old au¬ thors ; but only of detached passages, which may be selected from all of them, as earnests or first fruits of a new and brighter era in English literature. It may be safely affirmed, that in works, and in the prose compositions of Milton, are to.be found some of the finest sentences of which our language has yet to boast. To propose them now as models for imitation would be quite absurd. Dr I.owth certainly went much too far when he said, “ That in correctness, propriety, &a& purity of English style, Hooker hath hardly been surpassed, or even equalled, by any of his successors.”—Preface to Lowth’s English Grammar",Milton,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"

It is with the philosophical merits, however, of Hobbes, that we are alone concerned at present; and, in this point of view, what a space is filled in the subsequent history of our domestic literature, by his own works, and by those of his innume¬ rable opponents ! Little else, indeed, hut the systems which he published, and the contro¬ versies which they provoked, occurs, during the interval between Bacon and Locke, to mark the progress of English Philosophy, either in the study of the Mind, or in the kindred researches of Ethical and Political Science",Raleigh,US,8,United States,North America
"The period when Hobbes began his literary career, as well as the principal incidents of his life, were, in a singular degree, favourable to a mind like his; impatient of the yoke of autho¬ rity, and ambitious to attract attention, if not by solid and useful discoveries, at least by an ingenious defence of paradoxical tenets. After a residence of five years at Oxford, and a very extensive tour through France and Italy, he had the good fortune, upon his return to Eng¬ land, to be admitted into the intimacy and con¬ fidence of Lord Bacon ; a circumstance which, we may presume, contributed not a little to en¬ courage that bold spirit of inquiry, and that aversion to scholastic learning, which character¬ ise his writings. Happy, if he had, at the same time, imbibed some portion of that love of truth and zeal for the advancement of knowledge, which seem to have been Bacon s ruling pas¬ sions ! But such was the obstinacy of his tem¬ per, and his overweening self-conceit, that, in¬ stead of co-operating with Bacon in the execu¬ tion of his magnificent design, he resolved to rear, on a foundation exclusively his own, a com¬ plete structure both of Moral and Physical Science; disdaining to avail himself even of the materials collected by his predecessors, and treating the experimentarian philosophers as ob¬ jects only of contempt and ridicule !4 In the political writings of Hobbes, we may perceive the influence also of other motives",Oxford,"FR,IT,US",8,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"41 decidedly hostile to all the forms of popular go¬ vernment ; and it is said to have been with the design of impressing his countrymen with a just sense of the disorders incident to democratical establishments, that he published, in 1618, an English translation of Thucydides. In these opinions he was more and more confirmed by the events he afterwards witnessed in England; the fatal consequences of which he early foresaw with so much alarm, that, in 1640, he withdrew from the approaching storm, to enjoy the so¬ ciety of his philosophical friends at Paris. It was there he wrote his book De Give, a few copies of which were printed, and privately circulated in 1642. The same work was after¬ wards given to the public, with material cor¬ rections and improvements, in 1647, when the author’s attachment to the royal cause being strengthened by his personal connection with the exiled king, he thought it incumbent on him to stand forth avowedly as an advocate for those principles which he had long professed.

"The sudden tide of licentiousness, both in principles and in practice, which burst into this island at the moment of the Restoration, con¬ spired with the paradoxes of Hobbes, and with the no less dangerous errors recently propagated among the people by their religious instructors, to turn the thoughts of sober and speculative men towards ethical disquisitions. The esta¬ blished clergy assumed a higher tone than be¬ fore in their sermons; sometimes employing them in combating that Epicurean and Machia- velian philosophy which was then fashionable at court, and which may be always suspected to form the secret creed of the enemies of civil and religious liberty;—on other occasions, to over¬ whelm, with the united force of argument and learning, the extravagances by which the igno¬ rant enthusiasts of the preceding period had ex¬ posed Christianity itself to the scoffs of their li¬ bertine opponents. Among the divines who ap¬ peared at this era, it is impossible to pass over in silence the name of Barrow, whose theological works (adorned throughout by classical erudition, and by a vigorous, though unpolished eloquence), exhibit, in every page, marks of the same inven¬ tive genius which, in mathematics, has secured to him a rank second alone to that of Newton. As a writer, he is equally distinguished by the re¬ dundancy of his matter, and by the pregnant brevity of his expression; but what more pecu¬ liarly characterises his manner, is a certain air of powerful and of conscious facility in the exe¬ cution of whatever he undertakes. Whether the subject be mathematical, metaphysical, or theological, he seems always to bring to it a mind which feels itself superior to the occasion ; and which, in contending with the greatest dif¬ ficulties, “ puts forth but half its strength.” He has somewhere spoken of his Lectiones Ma~ thematicce (which it may, in passing, be remarked, display metaphysical talents of the highest order), as extemporaneous effusions of his pen; and I have no doubt that the same epithet is still more literally applicable to his pulpit discourses. It is, indeed, only thus we can account for the va¬ riety and extent of his voluminous remains, when we recollect that the author died at the age of forty-six.2 To the extreme rapidity with which Barrow committed his thoughts to writing, I am inclined to ascribe the hasty and not altogether consist- 1 The Intellectual System was published in 1678.

They seem to me to contain verv strong intrinsic evidence of the incorrectness of this anecdote. Mr ja am Hill, in his Account of the Life of Barrow, addressed to Dr Tillotson, contents himself with saying,_ that “ Some ot his ser¬ mons were written four or five times over;”—mentioning, at the same time, a circumstance which may accoun or is fact, in perfect consistency with what I have stated above,—that Barrow was very ready to lend his sermons as o en desired.” 46 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Newton,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"A few years before the death of Hobbes, Dr Cumberland (afterwards Bishop of Peterbo¬ rough) published a book, entitled, De Legibus Natures, Disquisitio Philosophical the principal aim of which was to confirm and illustrate, in opposition to Hobbes, the conclusions of Grotius, concerning Natural Law. The work is executed with ability, and discovers juster views of the object of moral science, than any modern sys¬ tem that had yet appeared; the author resting the strength of his argument, not, as Grotius had done, on an accumulation of authorities, but on the principles of the human frame, and the mutual relations of the human race. The cir¬ cumstance, however, which chiefly entitles this publication to our notice, is, that it seems to have been the earliest on the subject which at¬ tracted, in any considerable degree, the attention of English scholars. From this time, the writings of Grotius and of Puffendorff began to be gene¬ rally studied, and soon after made their way into the Universities. In Scotland, the im¬ pression produced by them was more peculiarly remarkable. They were everywhere adopted as the best manuals of ethical and of political in¬ struction that could be put into the hands of students, and gradually contributed to form that memorable school, from whence so many philo¬ sophers and philosophical historians were after¬ wards to proceed",Cumberland,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"Among these events, that which is most im¬ mediately connected with our present subject, is the establishment of the Royal Society of London in 1662, which was followed a few years afterwards by that of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. The professed object of both institutions was the improvement of Experi¬ mental Knowledge, and of the auxiliary science of Mathematics; but their influence on the general progress of human reason has been far greater than could possibly have been foreseen at the moment of their foundation. On the happy effects resulting from them in this re¬ spect, La Place has introduced some just reflec¬ tions in his System of the World, which, as they discover more originality of thought than he com¬ monly displays, when he ventures to step beyond the circumference of his own magic circle, I shall quote, in a literal translation of his words","London, Paris","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"By setting the example of submitting every thing to the examination of a severe logic, they have dissipated the prejudices which had too long reigned in the sciences, and which the strongest minds of the preceding centuries had not been able to resist. They have constantly opposed to empiricism a mass of knowledge, against which the errors adopted by the vulgar, with an enthusiasm which, in former times, would have perpetuated their empire, have spent their force in vain. In a word, it has been in their bosoms that those grand theories have been conceived, which, although far exalted by their generality above the reach of the multitude, are for this very reason entitled to special encourage¬ ment, from their innumerable applications to the phenonema of nature, and to the practice of the arts.”® In confirmation of these judicious remarks, it 1 Throughout the whole of this Discourse, I have avoided touching on the discussions which, on various occasions, have arisen with regard to the theory of government, and the comparative advantages or disadvantages of different political forms. Of the scope and spirit of these discussions it would be seldom possible to convey a just idea, without entering into details of a local or temporary nature, inconsistent with my general design. In the present circumstances of the world, besides, the theory of government (although, in one point of view, the most important of all studies) seems to possess a very subordinate interest to inquiries connected with political economy, and with the fundamental principles of legisla¬ tion. What is it, indeed, that renders one form of government more favourable than another to human happiness, but the superior security it provides for the enactment of wise laws, and for their impartial and vigorous execution ? These considerations will sufficiently account for my passing over in silence, not only the names of Needham, of Sidney, and of Milton, but that of Harrington, whose Oceana is justly regarded as one of the boasts of English literature, and is pronounced by Hume to be “ the only valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offered to the public.”—Essays and Trea¬ tises, Yol.

"2 The Royal Society of London, though not incorporated by charter till 1662, may be considered as virtually existing, at least as far back as 1638, when some of the most eminent of the original members began first to hold regular meetings at Gresham College, for the purpose of philosophical discussion. Even these meetings were but a continuation of those previously held by the same individuals, at the apartments of Dr Wilkins in Oxford.—See Sprat’s History of the Royal Society","London, Oxford","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"It is a very remarkable circumstance with re¬ spect to these economical researches, which now engage so much of the attention both of states¬ men and of philosophers, that they are altogether of modern origin. “ There is scarcely,” says Mr Hume, 11 any ancient writer on politics who has made mention of trade; nor was it ever con¬ sidered as an affair of state till the seventeenth century.”3—The work of the celebrated John de Witt, entitled, “ The true interest and political maxims of the republic of Holland and W est Fries¬ land,” is the earliest publication of any note, in which commerce is treated of as an object of na¬ tional and politicalconcern,in opposition to the par¬ tial interests of corporations and of monopolists",Holland,US,8,United States,North America
"His argument on this point is in substance the very same with that so well urged by Beattie, in opposition to Locke’s reasonings against the existence of innate practical principles. It is difficult to say, whether, in this instance, the coincidence between Montaigne and Locke, or that between Charron and Beattie, be the more remarkable.2 3 Although Charron has affected to give to his work a systematical form, by dividing and sub¬ dividing it into books and chapters, it is in re¬ ality little more than an unconnected series of essays on various topics, more or less distantly related to the science of Ethics. On the powers of the understanding he has touched but slight¬ ly ; nor has he imitated Montaigne, in anato¬ mizing, for the edification of the world, the pe¬ culiarities of his own moral character. It has probably been owing to the desultory and po¬ pular style of composition common to both, that so little attention has been paid to either by those who have treated of the history of French philosophy. To Montaigne’s merits, indeed, as a lively and amusing essayist, ample justice has been done; but his influence on the subsequent habits of thinking among his countrymen re¬ mains still to be illustrated. He has done more, perhaps, than any other author (I am inclined to think with the most honest intentions), to in¬ troduce into men's houses (if I may borrow an expression of Cicero) what is now called the new philosophy,—a philosophy certainly very different from that of Socrates. In the fashion¬ able world, he has, for more than two centuries, maintained his place as the first of moralists; a circumstance easily accounted for, when we at¬ tend to the singular combination, exhibited in his writings, of a semblance of erudition, with what Malebranche happily calls his air du monde, and air cavalier.'5 As for the graver and less attractive Charron, his name would pro¬ bably before now have sunk into oblivion, had it not been so closely associated, by the acci¬ dental events of his life, with the more cele¬ brated name of Montaigne.4 1 Montaigne, cet auteur charmant, Tour-a-tour profond et frivole, Dans son chateau paisiblement, Loin de tout frondeur malevole, Doutoit de tout impunement, Et se moquoit tres librement Des bavards fourrds de 1’e'cole",Cicero,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"In reading La Rochefoucauld, it should ne¬ ver be forgotten, that it was within the vortex of a court he enjoyed his chief opportunities of studying the world; and that the narrow and exclusive circle in which he moved was not likely to afford him the most favourable speci¬ mens of human nature in general. Of the Court of Lewis XIV. in particular, we are told by a very nice and reflecting observer (Madame de la Fayette), that C£ ambition and gallantry were the soul, actuating alike both men and wo¬ men. So many contending interests, so many different cabals were constantly at work, and in all of these, women bore so important a part, that love was always mingled with business, and business with love. Nobody was tranquil or in¬ different. Every one studied to advance him¬ self by pleasing, serving, or ruining others. Idle¬ ness and languor were unknown, and nothing was thought of but intrigues or pleasures.” In the passage already quoted from Voltaire, he takes notice of the effect of La Rochefou¬ cauld’s Maxims, in improving the style of French composition. We may add to this remark, that their effect has not been less sensible in vitiating the tone and character of French philosophy, by bringing into vogue those false and degrading representations of human nature and of human life, which have prevailed in that country, more or less, for a century past. Mr Addison, in one of the papers of the Taller, expresses his in¬ dignation at this general bias among the French writers of his age. “ It is impossible,” he ob¬ serves, “ to read a passage in Plato or Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without being a greater and better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modish French authors, or those of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that nation, without being, for some time, out of humour with myself, and at everything about me. Their business is to depreciate human nature, and to consider it under the worst appearances; they give mean interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions. In short, they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man, or between the species of man and that of the brutes.”1 It is very remarkable, that the censure here bestowed by Addison on the fashionable French wits of his time should be so strictly applicable to Helvetius, and to many others of the most admired authors whom France has produced in our own day. It is still more remarkable to find the same depressing spirit shedding its malig¬ nant influence on French literature, as early as the time of La Rochefoucauld, and even of Mon¬ taigne ; and to observe how very little has been done by the successors of these old writers, but to expand into grave philosophical systems their loose and lively paradoxes; disguising and for¬ tifying them by the aid of those logical princi¬ ples, to which the name and authority of Locke have given so wide a circulation in Europe","Of, Plato, Addison, Mon","FR,TR,CO,US,IN",8,"France,Turkey,Colombia,United States,India","Europe,Asia,South America,North America,Asia"
"If, in the physical sciences, his march be less sure than that of Galileo—if his logic be less cautious than that of Bacon—yet the very te¬ merity of his errors was instrumental to the progress of the human race. He gave activity to minds which the circumspection of his rivals could not awake from their lethargy. He call¬ ed upon men to throw off the yoke of authority, acknowledging no influence but what reason should avow: And his call was obeyed by a multitude of followers, encouraged by the bold¬ ness, and fascinated by the enthusiasm of their leader.” In these observations, the ingenious author has rashly generalised a conclusion deduced from the literary history of his own country. That the works of Bacon were but little read there till after the publication of D’Alembert’s Preliminary Discourse, is, I believe, an unquestionable fact;8 not that it necessarily follows from this, that, even in France, no previous effect had been produced by the labours of Boyle, of Newton, and of the other English experimentalists, trained in Bacon’s school. With respect to England, it is a fact not less certain, that at no period did the philosophy of Descartes produce such an impression on public opinion, either in Physics or in Ethics, as to give the slightest colour to the supposition, that it contributed, in the most distant degree, to the subsequent advances made by our countrymen in these sciences. In Logic and Metaphysics, indeed, the case was different. Here the writings of Descartes did much; and if they had been studied with proper attention, they might have done much more. But of this part of their me¬ rits, Condorcet seems to have had no idea. His eulogy, therefore, is rather misplaced than ex¬ cessive. He has extolled Descartes as the father of Experimental Physics: He would have been nearer the truth, if he had pointed him out as the father of the Experimental Philosophy of the Human Mind",Newton,"FR,US,UK",8,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"In the actual state of science, these speculations might well have been spared. Where is the sober metaphysician to be found, who now speaks of the immortality of the soul as a logi¬ cal consequence of its immateriality; instead of considering it as depending on the will of that Being by whom it was at first called into exist¬ ence ? And, on the other hand, is it not uni¬ versally admitted by the best philosophers, that whatever hopes the light of nature encourages beyond the present scene, rest solely (like all our other anticipations of future events) on the general tenor and analogy of the laws by which we perceive the universe to he governed ? The proper use of the argument concerning the im¬ materiality of mind, is not to establish any posi¬ tive conclusion as to its destiny hereafter ; hut to repel the reasonings alleged by materialists, as proofs that its annihilation must he the ob¬ vious and necessary effect of the dissolution of the body.1 I thought it proper to state this consideration pretty fully, lest it should be supposed that the logical method recommended by Descartes for studying the phenomena of mind, has any ne¬ cessary dependence on his metaphysical opinion concerning its being and properties, as a separate substance.2 3 Between these two parts of his system, however, there is, if not a demonstrative connection, at least a natural and manifest af¬ finity ; inasmuch as a steady adherence to his logical method (or, in other words, the habitual exercise of patient refection), by accustoming us to break asunder the obstinate associations to which materialism is indebted for the early hold it is apt to take of the fancy, gradually and insensibly predisposes us in favour of his me¬ taphysical conclusion. It is to be regretted, that, in stating this conclusion, his commentators should so frequently make use of the word spiri¬ tuality ; for which I do not recollect that his own works afford any authority. The proper expression is immateriality, conveying merely a negative idea; and, of consequence, implying nothing more than a rejection of that hypothesis concerning the nature of M(pd, which the scheme of materialism so gratuitously, yet so dogmati¬ cally assumes.5 The power of Reflection, it is well known, is the last of our intellectual faculties that unfolds itself; and, in by far the greater number of in¬ dividuals, it never unfolds itself in any consider¬ able degree. It is a fact equally certain, that, long before the period of life when this power begins to exercise its appropriate functions, the understanding is already preoccupied with a 1 “ We shall here be content,” says the learned John Smith of Cambridge, “with that sober thesis of Plato, in his Timasus, who attributes the perpetuation of all substances to the benignity and liberality of the Creator; whom he there¬ fore brings in thus speaking, vpik; ix. a6a.va.roi ovSi uXuroi, x. r.

You are not of yourselves immortal nor indissoluble, but would relapse and slide back from that being which I have given you, should I withdraw the influence of my own power from you ; but yet you shall hold your immortality by a patent from myself.""

"What am I ? he asks, in his second Meditation : A thinking being,—that is, a being doubting, quo pendeo, majora ista omnia non indefinite et potentia tantum, sed reipsa infinite in se habere, atque ita Deum esse; totaque vis argumenti in eo est, quod agnoscam fieri non posse ut existam talis naturae qualis sum, nempe ideam Dei in me habens, nisi revera Deus etiam existeret, Deus, inquam, file idem cujus idea in me est, hoc est, habens omnes illas perfectiones quas ego non comprehendere, sed quocunque modo attingere cogitatione possum, et nullis plane defectibus obnoxius. Ex his satis patet, ilium fallacem esse non posse : omnem enim fraudem et deceptionem a defectu aliquo pen- dere lumine natural! manifestum est.” The above argument for the existence of God (very improperly called by some foreigners an argument a priori), was long considered by the most eminent men m Europe as quite demonstrative. For my own part, although I do not think that it is by any means so level to the apprehension of common inquirers, as the argument from the marks of design every¬ where manifested in the universe, I am still less inclined to reject it as altogether unworthy of attention. It is far from being so metaphysically abstruse as the reasonings of Newton and Clarke, founded on our conceptions of space and of time; nor would it appear, perhaps, less logical and conclusive than that celebrated demonstration, if it were properly unfolded, and stated in more simple and popular terms. The two arguments, however, are in no respect exclusive of each other; and I have always thought, that, by combining them together, a proof of the point in question might be formed, more im¬ pressive and luminous than is to be obtained from either, when stated apart",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"1 How painful is it to recollect, that the philosopher who had represented his faith in the veracity of God, as the sole foundation of his confidence in the demonstrations of mathematics, was accused and persecuted by his contemporaries as an atheist; and that, too, in the same country (Holland), where, for more than half a century after his death, his doctrines were to be taught in all the universities with a blind idolatry ! A zeal without knowledge, and the influence of those earth¬ ly passions, from which even Protestant divines are not always exempted, may, it is to be hoped, go far to account for this inconsistency and injustice, without adopting the uncharitable insinuation of D’Alembert: “ Malgre toute la sagacite qu’il avoit employee pour nrouver 1’existence de Dieu, il fut accuse de la nier par des mimstres, qui peut-ctre ne la croyoient pas.""

This, accordingly, Descartes laid down as a first principle, that nothing comprehensible by the imagination can be at all subservient to the knowledge of Mind ; and that the sensible images involved in all our common forms of speaking concerning its operations, are to he guarded against with the most anxious care, as tending to confound, in our apprehensions, two classes of phenomena, which it is of the last importance to distinguish accurately from each other.2 To those who are familiarly acquainted with the writings of Locke, and of the very few among his successors who have thoroughly en¬ tered into the spirit of his philosophy, the fore¬ going observations may not appear to possess much either of originality or of importance; hut when first given to the world, they formed the greatest step ever made in the science of Mind, by a single individual. What a contrast do they ex¬ hibit, not only to the discussions of the school¬ men, but to the analogical theories of Hobbes at the very same periotf! and how often have they been since lost sight of, notwithstanding the clearest speculative conviction of their truth and importance, by Locke himself, and by the greatest part of his professed followers ! Had they been duly studied and understood by Mr Horne Tooke, they would have furnished him with a key for solving those etymological riddles, which, although mistaken by many of his con¬ temporaries for profound philosophical discove¬ ries, derive, in fact, the whole of their mystery, from the strong bias of shallow reasoners to re¬ lapse into the same scholastic errors, from which Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid, have so successfully laboured to emancipate the mind","Of, Berkeley","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"

A tew sentences before, Descartes explains with precision in what sense Imagination is here to be understood. “ Nihil aliud est imaginari quam rei corporeae figuram seu imaginem contemplari.” following extracts from a book published at Cambridge in 1660 (precisely ten years after the death of Descartes), while they furnish a useful comment on some of the above remarks, may serve to show, how completely the spirit of the Cartesian philosophy of Mind had been seized even then, by some of the members of that university",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"4. The most important, however, of all his improvements in metaphysics, is the distinction which he has so clearly and so strongly drawn between the primary and the secondary qualities of matter. This distinction was not unknown to some of the ancient schools of philosophy in Greece ; but it was afterwards rejected by Aris¬ totle, and by the schoolmen; and it was reserv¬ ed for Descartes to place it in such a light, as (with the exception of a very few sceptical or rather paradoxical theorists) to unite the opi¬ nions of all succeeding inquirers. For this step, so apparently easy, but so momentous in its con¬ sequences, Descartes was not indebted to any long or difficult processes of reasoning; but to those habits of accurate and patient attention to the operations of his own mind, which, from his early years, it was the great business of his life to cultivate. It may be proper to add, that the epithets primary and secondary, now universally employed to mark the distinction in question, were first introduced by Locke ; a circumstance posing his Treatise of Human Nature. Is it not probable, that be was partly attracted to it, by associations similar to those which presented themselves to the fancy of Cicero, when he visited the walks of the Academy ? In the beginning of Descartes’ dissertation upon Method, he has given a very interesting account of the pursuits which occupied his youth, and of the considerations which suggested to him the bold undertaking of reforming philosophy",Cicero,"GR,US",8,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"

So slow, however, is the progiess of good sense, when it has to struggle against the prejudices of the learned, that, as lately as 1713, the paradox so clearly explained and re¬ futed by Descartes, appears to have kept some footing in the English universities. In a papei of the Guardian, giving an account of a visit paid by Jack Lizard to his mother and sisters, after a year and half s residence at Oxford, the following precis is given of his logical attain¬ ments. “ For the first week (it is said) Jack dealt wholly in paradoxes.

"It is mortifying to reflect on the inconceivably small number of subsequent inquirers by whom the spirit of this cardinal maxim has been fully seized; and that, even in our own times, the old and inveterate prejudice to which it is op¬ posed, should not only have been revived with success, but should have been very generally re¬ garded as an original and profound discovery in metaphysical science. These circumstances must plead my apology for the space I have as¬ signed to the Cartesian Metaphysics in the crowded historical picture which I am at present attempting to sketch. The fulness of illustra¬ tion which I have bestowed on the works of the master, Avill enable me to pass over those of his disciples, and even of his antagonists, with a correspondent brevity.1 After having said so much of the singular merits of Descartes as the father of genuine me¬ taphysics, it is incumbent on me to add, that his errors in this science were on a scale ol propor¬ tionate magnitude. Of these the most promi¬ nent (for I must content myself with barely mentioning a few of essential importance) were his obstinate rejection of all speculations about final causes;2 his hypothesis concerning the lower animals, which he considered as mere ma¬ chines;3 4 his doctrine of innate ideas, as under¬ stood and expounded by himself;* his noted para¬ dox of placing the essence of mind in thinking, and of matter in extension ;5 and his new modi¬ fication of the ideal theory of perception, adopt¬ ed afterwards, with some very slight changes, by Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.0 To some of these errors I shall have occasion to refer in the sequel of this Discourse.

"f,9 the Alma of Prior. It is not, perhaps, equally known, that the circumstance which determined him to fix on this particular spot, was the very plausible consideration, that, among the different parts of the brain, this was the only one he could find, which, being single and central, was fitted for the habitation of a being, of which he conceived unity and indivisibility to be essen¬ tial and obvious attributes.1 In what manner the animal spirits, by their motions forwards and backwards in the nervous tubes, keep up the communication between this gland and the dif¬ ferent parts of the body, so as to produce the phenomena of perception, memory, imagination, and muscular motion, he has attempted parti¬ cularly to explain; describing the processes by which these various effects are accomplished, with as decisive a tone of authority, as if he had been demonstrating experimentally the circula¬ tion of the blood. How curious to meet with such speculations in the works of the same phi¬ losopher, who had so clearly perceived the ne¬ cessity, in studying the laws of Mind, of ab¬ stracting entirely from the analogies of Matter; and who, at the outset of his inquiries, had car¬ ried his scepticism so far, as to require a proof even of the existence of his own body ! To those, however, who reflect with attention on the method adopted by Descartes, this inconsist¬ ency will not appear so inexplicable as at first sight may be imagined; inasmuch as the same scepticism which led him to suspend his faith in his intellectual faculties till he had once proved to his satisfaction, from the necessary veracity of God, that these faculties were to be regarded as divine oracles, prepared him, in all the sub¬ sequent steps of his progress, to listen to the suggestions of his own fallible judgment, with more than common credulity and confidence",Alma,CA,8,Canada,North America
"The first traces of this hypothesis occur in some queries of Sir Isaac Newton, which he was pro¬ bably induced to propose, less from the convic¬ tion of his own mind, than from a wish to turn the attention of philosophers to an examination of the correspondent part of the Cartesian sys¬ tem. Not that I would be understood to deny that this great man seems, on more than one oc¬ casion, to have been so far misled by the ex¬ ample of his predecessor, as to indulge himself in speculating on questions altogether unsuscep¬ tible of solution. In the present instance, how¬ ever, there cannot, I apprehend, be a doubt, that it was the application made by Descartes of the old theory of animal spirits, to explain the mental phenomena, which led Newton into that train of thinking which served as the ground¬ work of Hartley’s Theory of Vibrations.2 It would be useless to dwell longer on the re- 1 See in particular, the treatise De Passionibus, Art. 31. 32.

In his physiological reveries on the union of soul and body, he wanders, like his master, in the dark, from the total want of facts as a foundation for his reasonings; hut even here his genius has had no inconsiderable in¬ fluence on the inquiries of later writers.

After reading the above passage, it is impossible to avoid reflecting, with satisfaction, on the effect which the progress of philosophy has since had, in removing those obstacles to the acquisition of useful knowledge, which were created by the pedantic taste prevalent two centuries ago. What a contrast to a quarto commentary on the definitions, postulates, axioms, and first eight propositions of Euclid’s First Book, is presented by Condorcet’s estimate of the time now sufficient to con¬ duct a student to the highest branches of Mathematics ! “ Dans le siecle dernier, il suffisoit de quelques anndes d’e'tude pour savoir tout ce qu’Archimede et Hipparque avoient pu connoitre ; et aujourd’hui deux annees de I’enseignement d’un professeur vont au dela de ce que savoient Leibnitz ou Newton.”—(Sur l'Instruction Publique.) In this particular science, I am aware that much is to be ascribed to the subsequent invention of new and more general methods; but, I apprehend, not a little also to the improvements gradually suggested by experience, in what Bacon calls the traditive part of logic","Euclid, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"1 “ Toutes nos differentes perceptions sont attachees aux differens changemens qui arrivent dans les fibres de la partie principale du cerveau dans laquelle Tame reside plus particulierement.”—(Rech. de la Verite, Liv, ii. chap, v.) These changes in the fibres of the brain are commonly called by Malebranche ebranlemens;—a word which is frequently rendered by his old English translator (Taylor) vibrations. “ La seconde chose,” says Malebranche, “ qui se trouve dans chacune des sensations, est Vebranlement des fibres de nos nerfs, qui se communique jusqu’au cerveau thus translated by Taylor: “ The second thing that occurs in every sensation is the vibration of the fibres of our nerves, which is communicated to the brain.”—Liv. i. chap, xii.) Nor was the theory of association overlooked by Malebranche.

"2 This objection, frivolous as it is, was strongly urged by Mr Boyle (Inquiry into the Vulgar Idea concerning Nature), and has been copied from him by Mr Hume, Lord Kaimes, and many other writers. Mr Hume’s words are these:—“ It ar¬ gues more wisdom to contrive at first the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight, that, of itself, and by its proper operation, it may serve all the purposes of Providence, than if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine.''—Essay on the Idea of Necessary Connection.) An observation somewhat similar occurs in the Treatise De Mundo, commonly ascribed to Aristotle",Providence,US,8,United States,North America
"Mr Hume was probably led to connect, in this last sentence, the name of Clarke with those of Locke and Cudworth, by taking for granted that his metaphysical opinions agreed exactly with those commonly ascribed to Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, on the point now in question, his creed was the same with that of Malebranche. The following sentence is very nearly a translation of a passage already quoted from the latter. “ The course of nature, truly and properly speaking, is nothing but the will of God producing certain effects in a continued, regular, constant, and uniform manner.”—Clarke’s Works Vol. II. p. 698.

"“ The conversation,” we are told, “ turned on the non-existence of matter.

"No publication, certainly, prior to Locke’s Essay, can be named, containing so much good sense, and so little nonsense on the science of Logic ; and very few have since appeared on the same subject, which can be justly preferred to it, in point of practical utility. If the author had lived in the present age, or had been less fetter¬ ed by a prudent regard to existing prejudices, the technical part would probably have been re¬ duced within a still narrower compass ; but even there, he has contrived to substitute for the puerile and contemptible examples of common logicians, several interesting illustrations from the physical discoveries of his immediate pre- ^ Thfs interview happenedin 1715, when Berkeley was in the thirty-first, and Malebranche in the seventy-seventh year of his age.

There is somethin/very different in the fortune of Malebranche and Locke. When Malebranche first appeared, it was with a general apnLse and admiration ; when Locke first published his Essay, he had hardly a single^ approver. Now Locke fsSersTrd Malebranche silnk into obscurity. All this maybe easily accounted for. The intrinsic merit of either was out of the question. But Malebranche supported his first appearance on a philosophy in the highest vogue , that phi- losophy has been^verturned by the Newtonian, and Malebranche has fallen with his master. It was to no purpose to tell the world, that Malebranche could stand without him. The public never examines so narrowly. Not but that there was another cause sufficient to do the business ; and that is, his debasing Ins noble work with his ^stein °^seei^^ things in God. When this happens to a great author, one half of his readers out of folly, the other out of malice, d veil only on the unsound part, and forget the other, or use all their arts to have it forgotten. , , ri-0v,riTlfllir n^mself bv “But the sage Locke supported himself by no system on the one hand; nor, on the other, did he dishonour himself by any whimsies. The consequence of which was, that, neither following the fashion, nor str^mg the imagination, he, at first, had neither followers nor admirers; but being everywhere clear, and everywhere solid, he at length worked his way and afterwards was subject to no reverses. He was not affected by the new fashions in philosophy, who leaned upon none of the old ; nor did he afford ground for the after-attacks of envy and folly by any fanciful hypotheses, which, when grown stale, are the most nauseous of all things.” , The foregoing reflections on the opposite fates of these two philosophers, do honour on the who « tration ; but the unqualified panegyric on Locke will be now very generally allowed to furnish an additional example of “ that national spirit? which,” according to Hume, “ forms the great happiness of the English, and pleads them to bestow on all their eminent writers such praises and acclamations, as may often appear partial and exceasive. u 3 The following very concise and accurate summary of Arnauld’s doctrine concerning ideas, is given by rue -er",Berkeley,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"
"Abstracting from his great merits in mathema¬ tics and in physics, his reputation rests chiefly on the Provincial Letters; a work from which Voltaire, notwithstanding his strong prejudices against the author, dates the fixation of the French language; and of which the same ex¬ cellent judge has said, that “ Moliere’s best comedies do not excel them in wit, nor the com¬ positions of Bossuet in sublimity.” The enthu¬ siastic admiration of Gibbon for this book, which he was accustomed from his youth to read once a year, is well known, and is sufficient to ac¬ count for the rapture with which it never fails to be spoken of by the erudite vulgar* in this country. I cannot help, however, suspecting, 1 According to Crousaz, The Art of Thinking contributed more than either the Organon of Bacon, or the Method of Des¬ cartes, to improve the established modes of academical education on the Continent—(See the Preface to his Logic, printed at Geneva, 1724.) Leibnitz himself has mentioned it in the most flattering terms; coupling the name of the author with that of Pascal, a still more illustrious ornament of the Port-Royal Society“ Ingeniosissimus Pascalius in prseclara dissertatione de ingemo Geometrico, cujus fragmentum extat in egregio hbro celeberrimi viri Antonii Ar- naldi de Arte bene Cogitandi,” &c..; but lest this encomium from so high an authority should excite a curiosity somewhat out of proportion to the real value of the two works here mentioned, I think it right to add, that the praises bestowed by Leibnitz, whether on living or dead authors, are not always to be strictly and literally interpreted. “ No one,” says Hume, “ is so liable to an excess of admiration as a truly great genius.” Wherever Leibnitz has occasion to refer to any work of solid merit, this remark applies to him with peculiar force ; partly, it is probable, from his quick and sympathetic perception of congenial excellence, and partly from a generous anxiety to point it out to the notice of the world. It af¬ fords, on the other hand, a remarkable illustration of the force of prejudice, that Buffler, a learned and most able Jesuit, should have been so far influenced by the hatred of his order to the Jansenists, as to distinguish the Port-Royal Logic with the cold approbation of being “ a judicious compilation fiom former works on the same subject,—particularly from a trea¬ tise by a Spanish Jesuit, Fonstca.""—Cours de Sciences, p. 873.

"The unconnected fragment of Pascal, entitled Thoughts on Religion, contains various reflec¬ tions which are equally just and ingenious; some which are truly sublime; and not a few which are false and puerile: the whole, how¬ ever, deeply tinctured with that ascetic and mor¬ bid melancholy, which seems to have at last produced a partial eclipse of his faculties. Vol¬ taire has animadverted on this fragment with much levity and petulance; mingling, at the same time, with many very exceptionable stric¬ tures, several of which it is impossible to dispute the justness. The following reflection is worthy of Addison, and bears a strong resemblance in its spirit to the amiable lessons inculcated in his papers on Cheerfulness;1 “To consider the world as a dungeon, and the whole human race as so many criminals doomed to execution, is the idea of an enthusiast; to suppose the world to be a seat of delight, where we are to expect nothing but pleasure, is the dream of a Sybarite ; but to conclude that the Earth, Man, and the lower Animals, are, all of them, subservient to the purposes of an unerring Providence, is, in my opinion, the system of a wise and good man.” From the sad history of this great and excel¬ lent person (on whose deep superstitious gloom it is the more painful to dwell, that, by an un¬ accountable, though not singular coincidence, it was occasionally brightened by the inoffen¬ sive play of a lively and sportive fancy) the eye turns with pleasure to repose on the mitts sa- pientta, and the Elysian imagination of Fenelon","Addison, Man, Providence","US,CI",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire","North America,Africa"
"The Adventures of Telemachus, when consider¬ ed as a production of the seventeenth centmy, and still more as the work of a Roman Catholic Bishop, is a sort of prodigy; and it may, to this day, be confidently recommended, as the best manual extant, for impressing on the minds of youth the leading truths, both of practical mo¬ rals and of political economy. Nor ought it to be concluded, because these truths appear to lie so near the surface, and command so immediately the cordial assent of the understanding, that they are therefore obvious or trite; for the case is the same with all the truths most essential to human happiness. The importance of agricul¬ ture and of religious toleration to the prosperity of states; the criminal impolicy of thwarting the kind arrangements of Providence, by re¬ straints upon commerce; and the duty of legis¬ lators to study the laws of the moral world as the groundwork and standard of their own, ap¬ pear, to minds unsophisticated by inveterate prejudices, as approaching nearly to the class of axioms;—yet, how much ingenious and refined discussion has been employed, even in our own times, to combat the prejudices which every¬ where continue to struggle against them; and how remote does the period yet seem, when there is any probability that these prejudices shall be completely abandoned ! {C But how,” said Telemachus to Narbal, “ can such a commerce as this of Tyre be es¬ tablished at Ithaca ?” “ By the same means,” said Narbal, “ that have established it here","Providence, Tyre, Ithaca","US,LB",8,"United States,Lebanon","North America,Asia"
"Receive all strangers with readiness and hospi¬ tality ; let them find convenience and liberty in your ports; and be careful never to disgust them by avarice or pride : above all, never re¬ strain the freedom of commerce, by rendering it subservient to your own immediate gain. The pecuniary advantages of commerce should be left wholly to those by whose labour it subsists ; lest this labour, for want of a sufficient motive, should cease. There are more than equivalent advantages of another kind, which must neces¬ sarily result to the Prince from the wealth which a free commerce will bring into his state; and commerce is a kind of spring, which to di¬ vert from its natural channel is to lose.”1 Had the same question been put to Smith or to Franklin in the present age, what sounder ad¬ vice could they have offered ? In one of Fenelon’s Dialogues of the Dead, the following remarkable words are put into the mouth of Socrates: “ It is necessary that a people should have written laws, always the same, and consecrated by the whole nation; that these laws should be paramount to every thing else; that those who govern should derive their authority from them alone; possessing an unbounded power to do all the good which the laws prescribe, and restrained from every act of injustice which the laws prohibit.” But it is chiefly in a work which did not ap¬ pear till many years after his death, that we have an opportunity of tracing the enlargement of Fenelon’s political views, and the extent of his Christian charity. It is entitled, Direction pour la Conscience d’un Roi; and abounds with as liberal and enlightened maxims of govern¬ ment as, under the freest constitutions, have ever been offered by a subject to a sovereign",Franklin,US,8,United States,North America

"One celebrated Work alone, the treatise of Grotius De Jure Belli et Pads (first printed in 1625), arrests our attention among the crowd of useless and forgotten volumes, which were then issuing from the presses of Holland, Ger¬ many, and Italy. The influence of this treatise, in giving a new direction to the studies of the learned, was so remarkable, and continued so long to operate with undiminished effect, that it is necessary to allot to the author, and to his successors, a space considerably larger than may, at first sight, seem due to their merits. Not¬ withstanding the just neglect into which they have lately fallen in our universities, it will be found, on a close examination, that they form an important link in the history of modern lite¬ rature. It was from their school that most of dur best writers on Ethics have proceeded, and many of our most original inquirers into the Human Mind; and it is to the same school (as 1 I have classed Ttltmaque and the Direction pour la Conscience d'un Rot with the philosophy of the seventeenth century, although the publication of the former was not permitted till after the death of Louis XIV. nor that of the latter till 1748",Holland,"IT,US",8,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"That moral distinctions are created entirely by the arbitrary and revealed will of God, had, be¬ fore his time, been zealously maintained by some theologians even of the reformed church; while, among the political theorists of the same period, it was not unusual to refer these distinctions (as was afterwards done hy Hobbes) to the positive institutions of the civil magistrate. In opposi¬ tion to both, it was contended hy Grotius, that there is a natural law coeval with the human constitution, from which positive institutions derive all their force; a truth which, how ob¬ vious and trite soever it may now appear, was so opposite in its spirit to the illiberal systems taught in the monkish establishments, that he thought it necessary to exhaust in its support all his stores of ancient learning. The older waiters on Jurisprudence must, I think, he al¬ lowed to have had great merit in dwelling so much on this fundamental principle; a principle which renders “ Man a Law to himself;” and which, if it be once admitted, reduces the meta¬ physical question concerning the nature of the moral faculty, to an object merely of speculative curiosity.1 2 To this faculty the ancients fre¬ quently give the name of reason; as in that noted passage of Cicero, where he observes, that “ right reason is itself a law ; congenial to the feelings of nature; diffused among all men; uniform ; eternal; calling us imperiously to our duty, and peremptorily prohibiting every viola¬ tion of it. Nor does it speak,” continues the same author, “ one language at Rome and ano¬ ther at Athens, varying from place to place, or time to time; hut it addresses itself to all na¬ tions and to all ages; deriving its authority from the common sovereign of the universe, and carrying home its sanctions to every breast, hy the inevitable punishment which it inflicts on transgressors.”3 The habit of considering morality under the similitude of a law (a law engraved on the hu¬ man heart), led not unnaturally to an applica¬ tion to ethical subjects of the technical language and arrangements of the Roman jurisprudence, and this innovation was at once facilitated and 1 “ Upon whatever we suppose that our moral faculties are founded, whether upon a certain modification of reason, upon an original instinct, called a moral sense, or upon some other principle of our nature, it cannot be doubted that they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They carry along with them the most evident badges of this autho¬ rity, which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, to superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained. The rules, therefore, which they prescribe, are to be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those vicege¬ rents which he has set up within us.”—Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part in. chap, v.)—See also Dr Butler’s very original and philosophical Discourses on Human Nature","Man, Cicero, Rome, Athens, Roman","US,CI,RO",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire,Romania","North America,Africa,Europe"
"To some indistinct conception among the earlier writers on Natural Law, of these peculiarities in the nature of justice, we may probably ascribe the remarkable contrast pointed out by Mr Smith, between the ethical systems of ancient and of modern times. “ In none of the ancient moralists,” he observes, “ do we find any at¬ tempt towards a particular enumeration of the rules of justice. On the contrary, Cicero in his Offices, and Aristotle in his Ethics, treat of jus¬ tice in the same general manner in which they treat of generosity or of charity.”1 But although the rules of justice are in every case precise and indispensable; and although their authority is altogether independent of that of the civil magistrate, it would obviously be absurd to spend much time in speculating about the principles of this natural law, as applicable to men, before the establishment of government",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"u This science, so much esteemed, and so as¬ siduously cultivated by the sages of antiquity, lay, for a length of time, in common with all the other useful arts, buried in the rubbish of the dark ages, till (soon after the commencement of the seventeenth century), the incomparable treatise of Grotius de Jure Belli et Pads restored to more than its ancient splendour that part of it which defines the relative duties of individu¬ als ; and which, in consequence of the immense variety of cases comprehended under it, is by far the most extensive of any. Since that period, the most learned and polite scholars of Europe, as if suddenly roused by the alarm of a trumpet, have vied with each other in the prosecution of this study,—so strongly recommended to their attention, not merely by its novelty, but by the importance of its conclusions, and the dignity of its object.”1 I have selected this passage, in preference to many others that might be quoted to the same purpose from writers of higher name; because, in the sequel of this historical sketch, it appears to me peculiarly interesting to mark the progress of Ethical and Political speculation in that seat of learning, which, not many years afterwards, was to give birth to the Theory of Moral Senti¬ ments, and to the Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. The powerful effect which the last of these works has produced on the political opinions of the whole civilised world, renders it unnecessary, in a Discourse destined to form part of a Scotish Encyclopedia, to offer any apology for attempting to trace, with some 1 The last sentence is thus expressed in the original. “ Ex illo tempore, quasi classico dato, ah eruditissirms Passim et politissimis viris excoli certatim coepit, utilissima hsec nohilissimaque doctrina.”—See the edition ot i utiendortt, De (JJicio Hominis et Civis, by Professor Gerschom Carmichael of Glasgow, 1724; an author whom Dr Hutchison pronounces to^be “ by far the best commentator on PuffendorfF; and “ whose notes,"" he adds, “ are of much more value than the text","Carmichael, Glasgow","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"PuffendorfPs principal work, entitled De Jure Naturae et Gentium, was first printed in 1672, and was aiterwards abridge by the author into the small volume referred to in the foregoing paragraph. The idea of Fuffendorff s ""y™? rormed by rlr Carmichael, coincides exactly with the account of it given in the text: “ Hoc demum tractatu edito, iacile intellexerunt sequiores harum rerum arbitri, non aliam esse genuinam Morum Philosophiam, quam quae ex evidentibus prmcipus, m ipsa rerum natura fundatis, hominis atque civis officia, in singulis vitae humanae circumstantiis debita, eruit ac demonstrat, atque adeo Juris Naturalis scientiam, quantumvis diversam ab Ethica quae in scholis dudum obtinuerat, prae se lerret faciem, non esse, quod ad scopum et rem tractandam, vere aliam disciplinam, sed eandem rectius duntaxat et sohdius tra- ditam, ita ut, ad quam prius male collineaverit, tandem reipsa feriret scopum.”—See Carmichael s edition ot the treatise De Officio Hominis et Civis, p. 7- _ . ",Carmichael,US,8,United States,North America
"To so late a period did this admiration of the treatise De Officio Hominis et Civis, continue in our Scotch Universities, that the very learned and respectable Sir John Pringle (afterwards President of the lloyal Society of London), adopted it as the text-bcok for his lectures, while he held the Professorship of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh. Nor does the case seem to have been different in England. “ I am going,” says Gray, in a letter written while a student at Cambridge, “ to attend a lecture on one Puffendorff” And, much in the same spirit, Voltaire thus expresses himself with respect to the schools of the Continent:—“ On est partage, dans les dcoles, entre Grotius et Puffendorff. Croyez-moi, hsez les Offices de Ciceron.” From the contemptuous tone of these two writers, it should seem that the old systems of Natural Jurispru¬ dence had entirely lost their credit among men of taste and of enlarged views, long before they ceased to form an essential part of academical instruction; thus affording an additional confirmation of Mr Smith’s complaint, that the greater part ot universities have not been very forward to adopt improvements after they were made; and that several of those learned societies have chosen to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems found shelter and protection, after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the world.” Considering his own successful exertions in his aca¬ demical capacity, to remedy this evil, it is more than probable that Mr Smith had Grotius and Puffendorff in his view when he wrote the foregoing sentence","London, Edinburgh, Cambridge","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"The extravagance of the praise lavished on Grotius and Puffendorff, in the above citation from Carmichael, can he accounted for only by the degraded state into which Ethics had fallen in the hands of those who were led to the study of it, either as a preparation for the casuistical discussions subservient to the practice ofauricular confession, or to justify a scheme of morality which recommended the useless austerities of an ascetic retirement, in preference to the manly duties of social life. The practical doctrines inculcated by the writers on Natural Law, were all of them favourable to active virtue; and, how reprehensible soever in point of form, were not only harmless, but highly beneficial in their tendency. They were at the same time so di¬ versified (particularly in the work of Grotius) with beautiful quotations from the Greek and Roman classics, that they could not fail to pre¬ sent a striking contrast to the absurd and illibe¬ ral systems which they supplanted; and per¬ haps to these passages, to which they thus gave a sort of systematical connection, the progress which the science made in the course of the eighteenth century may, in no inconsiderable degree, be ascribed. Even now, when so very different a taste prevails, the treatise de Jure Belli et Pads possesses many charms to a classi¬ cal reader; who, although he may not always set a very high value on the author’s reasonings, must at least be dazzled and delighted with the splendid profusion of his learning","Carmichael, Roman","US,RO,GR",8,"United States,Romania,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe"
"In a late publication, from the title of which some attention to dates might have been expected, we are told, that “ Hobbes’s book De Give appeared but a little time before the treatise of Grotius whereas, in point of fact, Hobbes’s book did not appear till twenty-two years after it. A few copies were indeed printed at Paris, and privately circulated by Hobbes, as early as 1642, but the book was not published till 1647-—(See “ An Inquiry into the Foundation and History of the Law of Nations in Europe” &c. by Robert Ward of the Inner Temple, Esq. London, 1795). This inaccuracy, however, is trifling, when compared with those committed in the same work, in stating the distinguishing doctrines of the two systems","Paris, London","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"£t It might have been expected,” says Mr Smith, {C that the reasonings of lawyers upon the different imperfections and improvements of the laws of different countries, should have given occasion to an inquiry into what were the natural rules of justice, independent of all positive institution. It might have been ex¬ pected, that these reasonings should have led them to aim at establishing a system of what might properly be called Natural Jurisprudence, or a theory of the principles which ought to run through^ and to he the foundation of the laws of all nations. But, though the reasonings of lawyers did produce something of this kind, and though no man has treated systematically of the laws of any particular country, without intermixing in his work many observations of this sort, it was very late in the world before any such general system was thought of, or before the philosophy of laws was treated of by itself, and without regard to the particular institutions of any na¬ tion. Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which ought to run through, and be the foundation of the laws of all nations; and his Treatise of the Laws of Peace and War, with all its imperfections, is per¬ haps, at this day, the most complete work that has yet been given on the subject.” Whether this was, or was not, the leading object of Grotius, it is not material to decide; but if this was his object, it will not be disputed that he has executed his design in a very desul¬ tory manner, and that he often seems to have lost sight of it altogether, in the midst of those miscellaneous speculations on political, ethical, and historical subjects, which form so large a portion of his Treatise, and which so frequently succeed each other without any apparent con¬ nection or common aim.1 Nor do the views of Grotius appear always enlarged or just, even when he is pointing at the object described by Mr Smith. The Roman system of Jurisprudence seems to have warped, in no inconsiderable degree, his notions on all questions connected with the theory of legisla¬ tion, and to have diverted his attention from that philosophical idea of law, so well expressed by Cicero,—“ Non a prsetoris edicto, neque a duodecim tabulis, sed penitus ex intima philo- sophia, hauriendam juris disciplinam.” In this idolatry, indeed, of the Roman law, he has not gone so far as some of his commentators, who have affirmed, that it is only a different name for the Law of Nature; but that his partiality for his professional pursuits has often led him to overlook the immense difference between the state of society in ancient and modern Europe, will not, I believe, be now disputed. It must, at the same time, be mentioned to his praise, that no writer appears to have been, in theory) more completely aware of the essential distinc¬ tion between Natural and Municipal laws.

"In one very powerful paragraph, he expresses himself thus t—“ I have often said, that, after the writings of geometricians, there exists no¬ thing which, in point of strength, subtlety, and depth, can be compared to the works of the Ro¬ man lawyers. And as it would be scarcely pos¬ sible, from mere intrinsic evidence, to distin¬ guish a demonstration of Euclid’s from one of Archimedes or of Appollonius (the style of all of them appearing no less uniform than if rea¬ son herself were speaking through their organs), so also the Roman lawyers all resemble each other like twin-brothers; inasmuch that, from the style alone of any particular opinion or ar¬ gument, hardly any conjecture could be formed about its author. Nor are the traces of a re¬ fined and deeply meditated system of Natural Ju¬ risprudence anywhere to be found more visible, or in greater abundance. And even in those cases where its principles are departed from, either in compliance with the language conse¬ crated by technical forms, or in consequence of new statutes, or of ancient traditions, the con¬ clusions which the assumed hypothesis renders it necessary to incorporate with the eternal dic¬ tates of right reason, are deduced with the soundest logic, and with an ingenuity that ex¬ cites admiration. Nor are these deviations from the Law of Nature so frequent as is commonly apprehended.” In the last sentence of this passage, Leibnitz had probably an eye to the works of Grotius and his followers; which, however narrow and ti¬ mid in their views they may now appear, were, for a long time, regarded among civilians as savouring somewhat of theoretical innovation, and of political heresy","Euclid, Roman","US,RO",8,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"In touching formerly on some of Bacon’s ideas concerning the philosophy of law, I quoted a few of the most prominent of those fortunate anticipations, so profusely scattered over his works, which, outstripping the ordinary march of human reason, associate his mind with the luminaries of the eighteenth century, rather than with his own contemporaries. These an¬ ticipations, as well as many others of a similar description, hazarded by his hold yet prophetic imagination, have often struck me as resembling the pierres d’attente j utting out from the corners of an ancient building, and inviting the fancy to complete what was left unfinished of the architect’s design;—or the slight and broken sketches traced on the skirts of an American 1 Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, p. 323",,US,8,United States,North America

"Hence that Index of prohibited books, into which were put the history of the President de Thou ; the works on the liberties of the Gallican church; and (who could have believed it?) the transla¬ tions of the Holy Scriptures. Meanwhile, this tribunal, though always ready to condemn ju¬ dicious authors upon frivolous suspicions of heresy, approved those seditious and fanatical theologists, whose writings tended to the en¬ couragement of regicide, and the destruction of government. The approbation and censure of books (it is justly added) deserves a place in the history of the human mind.” The great glory of the Continent towards the end of the seventeenth century (I except only the philosophers of France) was Leibnitz. He was born as early as 1646, and distinguished him¬ self, while still a very young man, by a display of those talents which were afterwards to con¬ tend with the united powers of Clarke and of Newton. I have already introduced his name among the writers on Natural Law; but, in every other respect, he ranks more fitly with the contemporaries of his old age than with those of his youth. My reasons for thinking so will appear in the sequel.

"In 1666, Mr Locke, then in his thirty-fifth year, formed an intimate acquaintance with Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury; from which period a complete change took place, both in the direction of his studies, and in his habits of life. His attention appears to have been then turned, for the first time, to political subj ects: and his place of residence transferred from the university to the metropolis. From London (a scene which gave him access to a society very different from what he had previously lived in)4 he occasionally passed over to the Continent, where he had an opportunity of profiting by the conversation of some of the most distinguished persons of his age. In the course of his fo¬ reign excursions, he visited France, Germany, and Holland; but the last of these countries seems to have been his favourite place of resi¬ dence ; the blessings which the people there en¬ joyed, under a government peculiarly favourable to civil and religious liberty, amply compensat- 1 Published in the year 1676",Holland,"FR,DE,US",8,"France,Germany,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"The plan of the Essay on Human Understanding is said to have been formed as early as 1670; bat the various employments and avocations of the Author prevented him from finishing it till 1687, when he fortunately availed himself of the leisure which his exile in Holland afforded him, to complete his long meditated design. He re¬ turned to England soon after the Revolution, and published the first edition of his work in 1690; the busy and diversified scenes through which he had passed during its progress, having probably contributed, not less than the acade¬ mical retirement in which he had spent his youth, to enhance its peculiar and characte- ristical merits",Holland,US,8,United States,North America
"No one has opened a better and clearer way to reasoning.”2 In a passage of one of Warburton’s letters to Hurd, which I had occasion to quote in the first part of this Dissertation, it is stated as a fact, that, £C when Locke first published his Essay, he had neither followers nor admirers, and hardly a single approver.” I cannot help suspecting very strongly the correctness of this assertion, not only from the flattering terms in which the Essay is mentioned by Shaftesbury in the foregoing quotation, and from the frequent allusions to its doctrines by Addison and other popular writers of the same period, but from the unexampled sale of the book, during the fourteen years which elapsed between its publication and Locke’s death. Four editions were printed in the space of ten years, and three others must have ap¬ peared in the space of the next four; a refer¬ ence being made to the sixth edition by the au¬ thor himself, in the epistle to the reader, prefix¬ ed to all the subsequent impressions. A copy of the thirteenth edition, printed as early as 1748, is now lying before me.

"In the University of Cambridge, on the other hand, the Essay on Human Understanding was, for many years, regarded with a reverence ap¬ proaching to idolatry; and to the authority of some distinguished persons connected with that learned body may be traced (as will afterwards appear) the origin of the greater part of the ex¬ travagancies which, towards the close of the last century, were grafted on Locke’s errors, by the disciples of Hartley, of Law, of Priestley, of Tooke, and of Darwin.2 To a person who now reads with attention and candour the work in question, it is much more easy to enter into the prejudices which at first opposed themselves to its complete success, than to conceive how it should so soon have acquired its just celebrity. Something, I suspect, must be ascribed to the political importance which Mr Locke had previously acquired as the champion of religious toleration; as the great apostle of the Revolution ; and as the intrepid opposer of a tyranny which had been recently overthrown","University, Cambridge, Darwin","US,AU",8,"United States,Australia","North America,Oceania"
"The works of Descartes still continued to be studied and admired; and the combined systems of the English and the French metaphysicians served, in many respects, to correct what was faulty, and to supply what was deficient, in each. As to the ethical principles of Locke, where they appear to lean towards Hobbism, a powerful antidote against them was already prepared in the Treatise De Jure Belli et Pads, which was then universally and deservedly re¬ garded in this country as the best introduction that had yet appeared to the study of moral science. If Scotland, at this period, produced no eminent authors in these branches of learn¬ ing, it was not from want of erudition or of ta¬ lents ; nor yet from the narrowness of mind in¬ cident to the inhabitants of remote and insula¬ ted regions; but from the almost insuperable difficulty of writing in a dialect, which imposed upon an author the double task of at once ac¬ quiring a new language, and of unlearning his own.3 4 The success of Locke’s Essay, in some parts of the Continent, was equally remarkable; owing, no doubt, in the first instance, to the very accurate translation of it into the French language by Coste, and to the eagerness with which every thing proceeding from the author of the Letters m Toleration^ may be presumed to 1 “ It was proposed at a meeting of the heads of houses of the University of Oxford, to censure and discourage the reading of Locke’s Essay; and, after various debates among themselves, it was concluded, that each head of a house should endeavour to prevent its being read in his college, without coming to any public censure.”—(See Des Maizeaux’s note on a letter from Locke to Collins—Locke’s Works, Vol. X. p. 284","University, Oxford","US,FR,UK",8,"United States,France,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"* I have taken notice, with due praise, in the former part of this discourse, of the metaphysical speculations of John Smith, Henry More, and Ralph Cudworth ; all of them members and ornaments of the University of Cambridge about the middle of the seventeeth century. They were deeply conversant in the Platonic Philosophy, and applied it with great success in combating the Materialists and Necessitarians of their times. They carried, indeed, some of their Platonic no¬ tions to an excess bordering on mysticism, and may, perhaps, have contributed to give a bias to some of their academical successors towards the opposite extreme. A very pleasing and interesting account of the characters of these amiable and ingenious men, and of the spirit of their philosophy, is given by Burnet in the History of his Own Times","University, Cambridge",US,8,United States,North America
"4 The principle of religious toleration was at that time very imperfectly admitted, even by those philosophers who were the most zealously attached to the cause of civil liberty. The great Scottish lawyer and statesman, Lord Stair, himself no mean philosopher, and, like Locke, a warm partizan of the Revolution, seems evidently to have regretted the impunity which Spinoza had experienced in Holland, and Hobbes in England. “ Execrabilis ille Atheus Spinosa adeo impudens est, ut affirmet omnia esse absolute necessaria, et nihil quod est, fuit, aut erit, aliter fieri potuisse, in quo omnes superiores Atheos excessit, aperte negans omnem Deitatem, nihilque pneter potentias natune agnoscens",Holland,US,8,United States,North America

He appears to have been warmly attached to Locke, and embraced the fundamental doctrines of his Essay without any slavish deference for his authority. Though he fixed his residence at Amsterdam, where he taught Philosophy and the Belles Lettres, he was a native of Geneva, where he also received his academical education. He is, therefore, to be numbered with Locke’s Swiss disciples. I shall have occasion to speak of him more at length afterwards, when I come to mention his controversy with Bayle. At present, I shall only observe, that his Eloge on Locke was published in the Biblioth&que Choisie (Anne'e 1705,) Tom.

"pointed at the Epicurean maxims of Hobbes and of Gassendi?1 Lord Shaftesbury was one of the first who sounded the alarm against what he conceived to be the drift of that philosophy which denies the existence of innate principles. Various strictures on this subject occur in the Characteristics ; par¬ ticularly in the treatise entitled Advice to an Au¬ thor ; but the most direct of all his attacks upon Locke is to be found in his 8th Letter, address¬ ed to a Student at the University. In this let¬ ter he observes, that “ all those called free wri¬ ters now-a-days have espoused those principles which Mr Hobbes set a foot in this last age.”— “ Mr Locke (he continues), as much as I ho¬ nour him on account of other writings (on Go¬ vernment, Policy, Trade, Coin, Education, To¬ leration, &c.) and as well as I knew him, and can answer for his sincerity as a most zealous Christian and believer, did however go in the self-same tract; and is followed by the Tindals, and all the other free authors of our times ! “ ’Twas Mr Locke that struck the home blow: for Mr Hobbes’s character, and base slavish principles of government, took off the poison of his philosophy. ’Twas Mr Locke that struck at all fundamentals, threw all order and virtue out of the world, and made the very ideas of these (which are the same with those of God) unnatural, and without foundation in our minds",University,US,8,United States,North America
"* Lord Shaftesbury should have said, “ grown up to the possession and exercise of his reasoning powers.” 3 I must, at the same time, again repeat, that the facts and reasonings contained in the introduction to Locke’s Essay go very far to account for the severity of Shaftesbury’s censures on this part of his work. Sir Isaac Newton himself, an in¬ timate friend of Locke’s, appears, from a letter of his which I have read in his own handwriting, to have felt precisely in the same manner with the author of the Characteristics. Such, at least, were his first impressions ; although he afterwards requested, with a humility and candour worthy of himself, the forgiveness of Locke, for this injustice done to his character",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"“ I beg your pardon (says he) for representing that you struck at the root of morality in a principle you laid down in your book of ideas, and designed to pursue in another book ; and that I took you for a Hobbist.” In the same letter Newton alludes to certain unfounded suspicions which he had been led to entertain of the propriety of Locke’s conduct in some of their private concerns; adding, with an ingenuous and almost infantine simplicity, ‘ I was so much affected with this, that when one told me you was sickly and would not live> I answered, ’twere better if you were dead. I desire you to forgive me this uncharitableness.” The letter is subscribed, your most humble and most unfortunate servant. Is.

"raries. On the contrary, Leibnitz speaks of the Treatise on Education as a work of still greater merit than the Essay on Human Understanding.1 2 * Nor will this judgment be wondered at by those who, abstracting from the habits of thinking in which they have been reared, transport them¬ selves in imagination to the state of Europe a hundred years ago. How flat and nugatory seem now the cautions to parents about watching over those associations on which the dread of spirits in the dark is founded ! But how different was the case (even in Protestant countiies) till a very recent period of the last century ! I have, on a former occasion, taken notice of the slow hut (since the invention of printing) cer¬ tain steps by which Truth makes its way in the world; “ the discoveries, which, in one age, are confined to the studious and enlightened few, be¬ coming, in the next, the established, creed of the learned; and, in the third, forming part of the elementary principles of education.” The har¬ mony, in the meantime, which exists among truths of all descriptions, tends perpetually, by blending them into one common mass, to increase the joint influence of the whole; the contributions of individuals to this mass (to borrow the fine allusion of Middleton) 44 resembling the drops of rain, which, falling separately into the water, mingle at once with the stream, and strengthen the general current.” Hence the ambition, so natural to weak minds, to distinguish themselves by paradoxical and extravagant opinions; for these, having no chance to incorporate themselves with the progressive reason of the species, are the more likely to immortalise the eccentricity of their authors, and to furnish subjects of won¬ der to the common compilers of literary history",Middleton,US,8,United States,North America
"Among these defects, the most prominent is, the facility with which he listens to historical evidence, when it happens to favour his own con¬ clusions. Many remarkable instances of this occur in his long and rambling argument (some¬ what in the style of Montaigne) against the ex¬ istence of innate practical principles; to which may be added, the degree of credit he appears to have given to the popular tales about mer¬ maids, and to Sir William Temple’s idle story of Prince Maurice’s 44 rational and intelligent parrot.” Strange ! that the same person who, in matters of reasoning, had divested himself, almost to a fault, of all reverence for the opinions of others, should have failed to perceive, that, of all the various sources of error, one of the most copious and fatal is an unreflecting faith in hu¬ man testimony !

"2 That this is a fair representation of the scope of Locke’s philosophy, according to the author’s own view of it, is demon¬ strated by the two mottos prefixed to the Essay on Human Understanding. The one is a passage of the book of Ecclesiastes, which, from the place it occupies in the front of his work, may be presumed to express what he himself regarded as the most important moral to be drawn from his speculations. “ As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so, thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all things.” The other motto (from Cicero) strongly expresses a sentiment which every competent judge must feel on comparing the above quo¬ tations from Locke, with the monads and the pre-established harmony of Leibnitz. “ Qnam bellum est velle confiteri potius nescire quod nescias, quam ista effutientem nauseare, atque ipsum sibi displicere !” See Note B B",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"A short abstract of the allegory with which Leibnitz concludes his Theodiccea, will convey a clearer idea of the scope of that work, than I could hope to do by any metaphysical comment. The groundwork of this allegory is taken from a dialogue on Free-Will, written by Laurentius Valla, in opposition to Boethius ;—in which dialogue, Sextus, the son of Tarquin the Proud, is introduced as consulting Apollo about his destiny. Apollo predicts to him that he is to violate Lucretia, and afterwards, with his family, to be expelled from Home. (Exul inopsque cades irata pulsus ub urbe.J Sextus complains of the prediction. Apollo replies, that the fault is not his; that he has only the gift of seeing into futurity ; * that all things are regulated by Jupiter; and that it is to him his complaint should be addressed. (Here finishes the allegory of Valla, which Leibnitz thus continues, agreeably to his own principles.) In consequence of the advice of the Oracle, Sextus goes to Dodona to complain to Jupiter of the crime which he is destined to perpetrate. “ Why (says he), oh Jupiter! have you made me wicked and miserable ? Either change my lot and my will, or admit that the fault is yours, not mine.” Jupiter replies to him : “ Renounce all thoughts of Rome and of the crown ; be wise, and you shall be happy. If you return to Rome you are undone.” Sextus, unwilling to submit to such a sacrifice, quits the Temple, and abandons himself to his fate","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Rome, Rome, Temple",US,8,United States,North America
"After his departure, the high priest, Theodorus, asks Jupiter why he had not given another Will to Sextus.' Jupiter sends Theodorus to Athens to consult Minerva. The goddess shows him the Palace of the Destinies, where are represen¬ tations of all possible worlds, each of them containing a Sextus Tarquinius with a different Will, leading to a catastrophe more or less happy. In the last and best of these worlds, forming the summit of the pyramid composed by the others, the high priest sees Sextus go to Rome, throw every thing into confusion, and violate the wife of his friend. “ You see” (says the Goddess of Wisdom) “it was not my father that made Sextus wicked.

"led to hazard principles more dangerous in their consequences, than the prejudices and errors which it was their aim to correct.1 The zeal of Leibnitz in propagating the dogma of Necessity is not easily reconcileable with the hostility which, as I have already remarked, he uniformly displays against the congenial doctrine of Materialism. Such, however, is the fact, and I believe it to be quite unprecedented in the pre¬ vious history of philosophy. Spinoza himself has not pushed the argument for necessity further than Leibnitz,—the reasonings of both conclud¬ ing not less forcibly against the free-will of God than against the free-will of man, and, of con¬ sequence, terminating ultimately in this pro¬ position, that no event in the universe could possibly have been different from what has actu¬ ally taken place.3 The distinguishing feature of this article of theLeibnitzian creed is, that, while the Hobbists and Spinozists were employing their ingenuity in connecting together Materialism and Necessity, as branches springing from one common root, Leibnitz always speaks of the soul as a machine purely spiritual,5—a machine, how¬ ever, as necessarily regulated by pre-ordained and immutable laws, as the movements of a clock or the revolutions of the planets. In consequence of holding this language, he seemed to represent Man in a less degrading light than other neces¬ sitarians ; but, in as far as such speculative te- events does the crime of Sextus draw after it ?

", .on0 ot Leibnitz’s controversial discussions with Dr Clarke, there is a passage which throws some light on his taste, not only m matters of science, but in judging of works of imagination. “ Du temps de M. Boyle, et d’autres excellens homines qui lleurissoient en Angleterre sous Charles II. on n’auroit pas ose nous debiter des notions si crenses. (The notions here al¬ luded to are those of Newton concerning the law of gravitation.) J’espcre que le beautemps reviendra sous un aussi bon enu- vernement que celui d a present. Le capital de M. Boyle etoit d’inculquer que tout se faisoit mechaniquement dans la phy¬ sique. Mais c est un malheur des hommes, de se degouter enfin de la raison meme, et de s’ennuyer de la lumiere. Les clnmeres commencent a revenir, et plaisent parce' qu’elles ont quelque chose de merveilleux. II arrive dans le pays philo- sophique ce qui est arrive dans le pays poetique. On s’est lasse' des romans raisonnables, tel que la Clelie Francoise ou l Aramene Allemande; et on est revenu depuis quelque temps aux Contes des Fles.""—(Cinquieme Ecrit de M. Leibnitz p. 260.) b rom this passage it would seem, that Leibnitz looked forward to the period, when the dreams of the Newtonian philo¬ sophy would give way to some of the exploded mechanical theories of the universe ; and when the Fairy-tales then in fa¬ shion (among which number must have been included those of Count Anthony Hamilton) would be supplanted by the re¬ vival ot such reasonable Romancesfs the Grand Clelia. In neither of these instances does there seem to be much probability, at present, that his prediction will be ever verified. 1 i lbej<^.ri?a? wl'!ter‘Vvho, of late years> have made the greatest noise among the sciolists of this country, will be found m ^‘Zni l0r 1 ,r. fai”e t0 the new which they have struck out, than to the unexpected and grotesque forms in Hinch they have combined together the materials supplied by the invention of former ages, and of other nations.

"I. Of the principle of the Sufficient Reason, the following succinct account is given by Leib¬ nitz himself, in his controversial correspondence with Dr Clarke: “ The great foundation of Mathematics is the principle of contradiction or identity; that is, that a proposition cannot be true and false at the same time. But, in order to proceed from Mathematics to Natural Philo¬ sophy, another principle is requisite (as I have observed in my Theodiccea); I mean, the prin¬ ciple of the Sufficient Reason ; or, in other words, that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so, rather than otherwise : And, ac¬ cordingly, Archimedes was obliged, in his book De JEquilibrio, to take for granted, that if there be a balance, in which every thing is alike on both sides, and if equal weights are hung on the two ends of that balance, the whole will be at rest. It is because no reason can be given why one side should weigh down rather than the other. Now, by this single principle of the Sufficient Reason, may be demonstrated the being of a God, and all the other parts of Metaphysics or Natural Theology; and even, in some measure, those physical truths that are independent of Mathematics, such as the Dynamical Principles, or the Principles of Forces.” to a Scotch gentleman, Mr Burnet of Kemney ; to whom he seems to have unbosomed himself on all subjects without any reserve: “ Mon livre intitule' Essais de Theodicee, sur la bonte de Dieu, la liberte de I’homme, et 1’origine de mal, sera bientot acheve. La plus grande partie de cet ouvrage avoit ete' faite par lambeaux, quand je me trouvois chez la feue Heine de Prusse, oil ces matieres dtoient souvent agite'es a 1’occasion du Dictionnaire et des autres ouvrages de M. Bayle, qu’on y lisoit beaucoup. Apres la mort de cette grande Princesse, j’ai rassemble' et augments ces pie'ces sur Pexhortation des amis qui en e'toient informes, et j’en ai fait Pouvrage dont je viens de parler. Comme j’ai medite' sur cette matiere depuis ma jeunesse, je pretends de Pavoir discutee a fond.”—(Leibnitz, Opera, Tom. VI. p. 284.) In another letter to the same correspondent, he expresses himself thus: / “ La plupart de mes sentimens ont e'te' enfin arrete's apres une deliberation de 20 ans: car j’ai commence bien jeune a mediter, et je n’avois pas encore 15 ans, nuand je me promenois des journees entieres dans un bois, pour prendre parti entre Aristote et Lemocrite. Cependant j’ai change et rechange sur des nouvelles lumieres, et ce n’est que depuis environ 12 ans que je me trouve satisfait, et que je suis arrive a des demonstrations sur ces matieres qui n en paroissent point capables : Cependant de la maniere que je m’y prends, ces demonstrations peuvent etre sensibles comme cedes des nombres, quoique le sujet passe 1’imagination.”—(Ibid. p. 253.) The letter from which this last paragraph is taken is dated in the year 1697> My chief reason for introducing these extracts, was to do away an absurd suspicion, which has been countenanced by some respectable writers (among others bv Le Clerc), that the opinions maintained in the Theodicee of Leibnitz were not his real sentiments, and that his own creed, on the most important questions there discussed, was not very different from that of Bayle. Gibbon has even gone so far as to say, that “ in his defence of the attributes and providence of the Deity, he was suspected of a secret correspondence with his adversary.”—(Antiquities of the House of Brunswick.) In support of this very improbable charge, I do not know that any evidence has ever been produced, except the following passage, in a letter of his, addressed to a Professor of Theology in the University of Tubingen (Pfaffius):—“ Ita prorsus est, vir summe re- verende, uti scribis, de Theodicaea mea. Item acu tetigisti; et miror, neminem hactenus fuisse, qui sensum hunc meum senserit. Neque enim Philosophorum est rem serio semper agere ; qui in fingendis hypothesibus, uti bene mones, ingenii sui vires experiuntur. Tu, qui Theologus, in refutandis erroribus Theologum agis.” In reply to this it is observed, by the learned editor of Leibnitz’s works, that it is much more probable that Leibnitz should have expressed himself on this particular occasion in jocular and ironical terms, than that he should have wasted so much ingenuity and learning in sup¬ port of an hypothesis to which he attached no faith whatever; an hypothesis, he might have added, with which the whole principles of his philosophy are systematically, and, as he conceived, mathematically connected. It is difficult to believe, that among the innumerable correspondents of Leibnitz, he should have selected a Professor of Theology at Tubingen, as the sole depository of a secret which he was anxious to conceal from all the rest of the world","Of, Mon, Brunswick, University","US,TR,IN",8,"United States,Turkey,India","North America,Asia,Asia"
"“ II disoit encore que PEternel Gedmetre resolvoit sans cesse ce Probleme; Pdtat d’une monade dtant donnd, en ddter- miner Pdtat passd, prdsent, et futur de tout Punivers.”—Bonnet, Tom. VIII. p. 303, 304, 305.) 3 Since the time of Leibnitz, the principle of the sufficient reason has been adopted by some mathematicians as a legiti¬ mate mode of reasoning in plane geometry ; in which case, the application made of it has been in general just and logical, notwithstanding the vague and loose manner in which it is expressed. In this science, however, the use of it can never be attended with much advantage; except perhaps in demonstrating a few elementary truths (such as the 5th and 6th propo¬ sitions of Euclid’s first book), which are commonly established by a more circuitous process : and, even in these instances, the spirit of the reasoning might easily be preserved under a different form, much less exceptionable in point of phraseology",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America
"One of the earliest, and certainly the most illustrious, of all the partizans and defenders of this principle, was John Bernouilli, whose dis¬ course on motion first appeared at Paris in 1727, having been previously communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences, in 1724 and 1726.1 It was from this period it began to attract the general attention of the learned; although many years were yet to elapse, before it was to ac¬ quire that authority which it now possesses among our most eminent mathematicians",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"Mr Maclaurin, whose Memoir on the Percus¬ sion of Bodies gained the prize from the Royal Academy of Sciences, in 1724, continued from that time, till his death, the steady opposer of this new lawt. In his Treatise of Fluxions, pub¬ lished in 1742, he observes, that “ the existence of hard bodies void of elasticity has been reject¬ ed for the sake of what is called the Law of Continuity ; a law which has been supposed to be general, without sufficient ground.” 2 And still more explicitly, in his Posthumous Account of Newton's Philosophical Discoveries, he complains of those who “ have rejected hard bodies as im¬ possible, from far-fetched and metaphysical con¬ siderationsproposing to his adversaries this unanswerable question, “ Upon what grounds is the law of continuity assumed as an universal law of nature ?”s 1 “ En effet (says Bernouilli), un pareil principe de duretd (the supposition to wit of bodies perfectly hard) ne scauroit exister ; c’est une chimere qui repugne a cette loi generale que la nature observe constarament dans toutes ses operations ; je parle de cet ordre immuable et perpe'tuel etabli depuis la creation de Punivers, qu'on pent appeller nor de continuite, en vertu de laquelle tout ce qui s’execute, s’execute par des degres infiniment petits. II semble que le bon sens dicte, qu’aucun changement ne peut se faire par saut; natura non opcratur per saltum; rien ne peut passer d’une extremite a Pautre, sans passer par tous les degres du milieu,” &c. The continuation of this passage (which I have not room to quote) is curious, as it suggests an argument, in proof of the law of continuity, from the principle of the sufficient reason",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Charles Bonnet of Geneva, a man of unques¬ tionable talents and of most exemplary worth, was, as far as I know, the first who entered fully into the views of Leihnitz on this point; perceiving how inseparably the law of con¬ tinuity (as well as the principle of the suffi¬ cient reason) was interwoven with his scheme of universal concatenation and mechanism; and inferring from thence not only all the paradoxi¬ cal corollaries deduced from it hy its author, hut some equally hold conclusions of his own, which Leihnitz either did not foresee in their full extent, or to which the course of his inquiries did not particularly attract his attention. The most remarkable of these conclusions was, that all the various beings which compose the uni¬ verse, form a scale descending downwards with¬ out any chasm or saltus, from the Deity to the simplest forms of unorganised matter;3 a pro¬ position not altogether new in the history of philosophy, hut which I do not know that any writer before Bonnet had ventured to assert as a metaphysical and necessary truth. With what important limitations and exceptions it must he received, even when confined to the compa- ed, that no body can pass instantaneously from motion to rest; because it is an immutable law of nature that all bodies shall be flexible.”—(Robins, Vol. II. p. 174. 175-) In quoting these passages, I would not wish to be understood as calling in question the universality of the Law of Con¬ tinuity in the phenomena of moving bodies; a point on which I am not led by the subject of this discourse to offer any opinion; but on which I intend to hazard some remarks in a Note at the end of it—See Note LD. All that I would here assert is, that it is a law, the truth of which can be inferred only by an induction from the phenomena; and to which, ac¬ cordingly, we are not entitled to say that there cannot possibly exist any exceptions",Geneva,US,8,United States,North America
"wltichhave associated so closely tlie name of Leib¬ nitz with that of Newton, in the history of modern science; of the inexhaustible treasures of his erudition, both classical and scholastic ; of his vast and manifold contributions towards the elucidation of German antiquities and of Roman jurisprudence ; or of those theological controver¬ sies, in which, while he combated with one hand the enemies of revelation, he defended, with the other, the orthodoxy of his own dogmas against the profoundest and most learned divines of Eu¬ rope. Nor would I have digressed so far as to allude here to these particulars, were it not for the unparalleled example they display, of what a vigorous and versatile genius, seconded by habits of persevering industry, may accomplish, within the short span of human life. Even the relaxations with which he was accustomed to fill up his moments of leisure, partook of the general character of his more serious engagements. By early and long habit, he had acquired a singular facility in the composition of Latin verses; and he seems to have delighted in loading his muse with new fetters of his own contrivance, in ad¬ dition to those imposed by the laws of classical prosody.1 The number, besides, of his literary correspondents was immense ; including all that was most illustrious in Europe : and the rich materials everywhere scattered over his letters are sufficient of themselves to show, that his amusements consisted rather in a change of ob¬ jects, than in a suspension of his mental activi¬ ty. Yet while we admire these stupendous mo¬ numents of his intellectual'energy, we must not forget (if I may borrow the language of Gibbon) that “ even the powers of Leibnitz were dissipat¬ ed by the multiplicity of his pursuits. He at¬ tempted more than he could finish; he designed more than he could execute; his imagination was too easily satisfied with a bold and rapid glance on the subject which he was impatient to leave ; and he may be compared to those heroes L37 whose empire has been lost in the ambition of universal conquest.”* From some expressions which Leibnitz has occasionally dropped, I think it probable, that he himself became sensible, as he advanced in life, that his time might have been more pro¬ fitably employed, had his studies been more con¬ fined in their aim. “ If the whole earth (he has observed on one occasion) had continued to be of one language and of one speech, human life might be considered as extended beyond its pre¬ sent term, by the addition of all that part of it which is devoted to the acquisition of dead and foreign tongues. Many other branches of know¬ ledge, too, may, in this respect, be classed with the languages; such as Positive Laws, Cere¬ monies, the Styles of Courts, and a great pro¬ portion of what is called critical erudition. The utility of all these arises merely from opinion; nor is there to be^found, in the innumerable volumes that have been written to illustrate them, a hundredth part, which contains any¬ thing subservient to the happiness or improve¬ ment of mankind.” The most instructive lesson, however, to be drawn from the history of Leibnitz, is the in¬ competency of the most splendid gifts of the un¬ derstanding, to advance essentially the interests either of Metaphysical or of Ethical Science, un¬ less accompanied with that rare devotion to truth, which maybe regarded, if not as the basis, at least as one of the most indispensable elements, of mo¬ ral genius. The chief attraction to the study of philosophy, in his mind, seems to have been (what many French critics have considered as a chief source of the charms of the imitative arts) the pride of conquering difficulties: a feature of his character which he had probably in his own eye, when he remarked (not without some de¬ gree of conscious vanity), as a peculiarity in the turn or cast of his intellect, that to him “ all difficult things were easy, and all easy things 1 A remarkable instance of this is mentioned by himself in one of his letters. “ Annos natus tredecim una die trecentos versus hexametros effudi, sine elisione omnes, quod hoc fieri facile posse forte affirmassem.” (Leib. Op. Tom. V. p. 304.) He also amused himself occasionally with writing verses in German and in French","Newton, Roman","DE,FR,US,RO",8,"Germany,France,United States,Romania","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"
"difficult.”1 Hence the disregard manifested in his writings to the simple and obvious conclu¬ sions of experience and common sense; and the perpetual effort to unriddle mysteries over which an impenetrable veil is drawn. “ Scilicet su¬ blime et erectum ingenium, pulehritudinem ac speciem excelsse magnseque gloria? vehementius quam caute appetebat.” It is to he regretted, that the sequel of this fine eulogy does not equal¬ ly apply to him. “ Mox mitigavit ratio et eetas; retinuitque, quod est difficillimum, et in sapientia modum.” 2 How happily does this last expression characterise the temperate wisdom of Locke, when contrasted with that towering, but impo¬ tent ambition, which, in the Theories of Opti¬ mism and of Pre-established Harmony, seemed to realize the fabled revolt of the giants against the sovereignty of the gods ! After all, a similarity may be traced between these two great men in one intellectual weakness common to both; a facility^n the admission of facts, stamped sufficiently (as we should now think) by their own intrinsic evidence, with the marks of incredibility. The observation has been often made with respect to Locke; hut it would be difficult to find in Locke’s writings, any thing so absurd as an account gravely trans¬ mitted by Leibnitz to the Abbe de St Pierre, and by him communicated to the Royal Acade¬ my of Sciences at Paris, of a dog who spoke.5 No person liberally educated could, I believe, be found at present in any Protestant country of Christendom, capable of such credulity. By what causes so extraordinary a revolution in the minds of men has been effected, within the short space of a hundred years, I must not here stop to inquire. Much, I apprehend, must be ascribed to our enlarged knowledge of nature, and more particularly to those scientific voyages and tra¬ vels which have annihilated so many of the prodigies which exercised the wonder and sub¬ dued the reason of our ancestors. But, in what¬ ever manner the revolution is to he explained, there can be no doubt that this growing dispo¬ sition to weigh scrupulously the probability of alleged facts against the faith due to the testi¬ monies brought to attest them, and, even in some cases, against the apparent evidence of our own senses, enters largely and essentially into the composition of that philosophical spirit or temper, which so strongly distinguishes the eighteenth century from all those which preced¬ ed it.4 It is no small consolation to reflect, that some important maxims of good sense have been thus familiarised to the most ordinary un¬ derstandings, which, at so very recent a period, failed in producing their due effect on two of the most powerful minds in Europe","Paris, Much","US,DE",8,"United States,Germany","North America,Europe"

"2 In conformity to the plan announced in the preface to this Dissertation, I confine myself to those authors whose opinions have had a marked and general influence on the subsequent history of philosophy; passing over a multitude of other names well worthy to be recorded in the annals of metaphysical science. Among these, I shall only mention the name of Boyle, to whom the world is indebted, beside some very acute remarks and many fine illustrations of his own upon metaphysical questions of the highest moment, for the philosophical arguments in defence of religion, which have added so much lustre to the names of Derham and Bentley ; and, far above both, to that of Clarke.* The remarks and illustrations, which I here refer to, are to be found in his Inquiry into the Vulgar Notion of Nature, and in his Essay, inquiring whether, and how, a Natu¬ ralist should consider Final Causes. Both of these tracts display powers which might have placed their author on a level with Descartes and Locke, had not his taste and inclination determined him more strongly to other pursuits. I am inclined to think, that neither of them is so well known as were to be wished. I do not even recollect to have seen it anywhere no¬ ticed, that some of the most striking and beautiful instances of design in the order of the material world, which occur in the Sermons preached at Boyle’s Lecture, are borrowed from the works of the founder, -f- Notwichstanoing, however, these great merits, he has written too little on such abstract subjects to entitle him to a place among English metaphysicians; nor has he, like Newton, started any leading thoughts which have since given a new direc¬ tion to the studies of metaphysical inquirers.

"voted much of his time to Metaphysical re¬ searches, yet the general spirit of his physical investigations has had a great, though indiiect, influence on the metaphysical studies of his suc¬ cessors. It is justly and profoundly remarked hy Mr Hume, that “ while Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he showed, at the same time, the impel- fections of the mechanical philosophy, and there¬ by restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity in which they ever did, and ever will remain",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"It is chiefly too since the time of Newton, that the ontology and pneumatology of the dark ages have been abandoned for inquiries resting on the solid basis of experience and analogy; and that philosophers have felt themselves emboldened by his astonishing discoveries concerning the more distant parts of the material universe, to argue from the known to the unknown parts of the moral world. So completely has the pre¬ diction been verified which he himself hazarded, in the form of a query, at the end of his Optics, that “ if natural philosophy should continue to be improved in its various branches, the hounds of moral philosophy would he enlarged also.” How far the peculiar cast of Newton’s genius qualified him for prosecuting successfully the study of Mind, he has not afforded us sufficient data for judging; but such was the admiration with which his transcendent powers as a Mathe¬ matician and Natural Philosopher were univer¬ sally regarded, that the slightest of his hints on other subjects have been eagerly seized upon as indisputable axioms, though sometimes with little other evidence in their favour hut the sup¬ posed sanction of his authority.1 The part of his works, however, which chiefly led me to con¬ nect his name with that of Clarke, is a passage in the Scholium annexed to his Principal,2 which may he considered as the germ of the celebrated real antagonist in this controversy. “ M. Clarke, ou plut6t M. Newton, dont M. Clarke soutient les dogmes, est en dispute avec moi sur la philosophie”_(LEiB. Op. Tom. Y. p. 33.) From another letter to the same correspondent we learn that Leibnitz aimed at nothing less than the complete overthrow of the Newtonian philosophy; and that it was chieHy to his trrand nrincinle of the sufficient reason that he trusted for the accomplishment of this object.

"2 This Scholium, it is to be observed, first appeared at the end of the second edition of the Pnncipta, printed at Cambridge in 1713. The'former edition, published at London in 1687, has no Scholium annexed to it. From a passage, however, in a letter of Newton’s to Dr Bentley (dated 1692), it seems probable, that as far back, at least, as that period, he had tnoughts of attempting a proof a priori of the existence of God. After some new illustrations, drawn from his own discoveries, of the common argument from final causes, he thus concludes : “ There is yet another argument for a Deity, which I take to be a very strong one; but, till the principles on which it is grounded are better received, I think it more advisable to let it sleep.” (l'our Letters from Sir I. Newton to Dr Bentley, p. 11. London, Dodsley, 1756.) It appears from this passage, that Newton had no intention, like his predecessor Ilescartes, to supersede, by any new ar¬ gument of his own for the existence of God, the common one drawn from the consideration of final causes;^, therefore, nothing could be more uncandid than the following sarcasm pointed by Pope at the laudable attempts of his two country¬ men to add to the evidence of this conclusion, by deducing it from other principles: “ Let others creep by timid steps and slow, On plain experience lay foundations low, By common sense to common knowledge bred","Cambridge, London, Newton, Newton, London, Newton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

"It is not, therefore, surprising, that Newton and Clarke should have fallen into that train of thought which encouraged them to attempt a demonstration of the being of God from our conceptions of Immensity and Eternity; and still less is it to be wondered at, that, in pursu¬ ing this lofty argument, they should have soar¬ ed into regions where they were lost in the clouds",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"I have said above, that Clarke’s demonstra¬ tion seems to have been suggested to him by a passage in Newton’s Scholium. It is, however, 1 Thus translated by Dr Clarke: “ God is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniscient; that is, he endures from everlasting to everlasting, and is present from infinity to infinity. He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite, lie is not duration or space, but he endures and is present. He endures always, and is present everywhere, and by exist¬ ing always and everywhere, constitutes duration and space.”—(See Clarke’s Fourth Reply to Leibnitz.) 2 An argument substantially the same with this for the existence of God, is hinted at very distinctly by Cudworth, Intellect. System, Chap. Y. sect. 3. 4. Also by Dr Henry More, Enchir. Metaph. Cap. 8. sect. 8. See Mosheim’s TransU of Cudworth, Tom. II. p. 356",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"“ One of his parents,” says Whiston, “ ask¬ ed him when he was very young, Whether God could do every thing ? He answered, Yes ! He was asked again, Whether God could tell a lie ? He answered, No ! And he understood the ques¬ tion to suppose, that this was the only thing that God could not do; nor durst he say, so young was he then, that he thought there was any thing else which God could not do; while yet, well he remembered, that he had, even then, a clear conviction in his own mind, that there was one thing which God could not do ;—that he could not annihilate that space which was in the room where they were.”x With this early and deep impression on his mind, it is easy to conceive how Newton’s Scholium should have encouraged him to resume the musings of his boyish days, concerning the necessary existence of space; and to trace, as far as he could, its connection with the prin¬ ciples of Natural Theology. But the above anec¬ dote affords a proof how strongly his habits of thought had long before predisposed him for the prosecution of a metaphysical idea, precisely the same with that on which this Scholium proceeds",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

In examining these, the attentive reader will be satisfied, that Locke’s declaration is not (as Priestley asserts) in favour of the Liberty of Spontaneity, but in favour of the Liberty of Indifference ; for as to the former, there seems to be no difficulty in reconciling it with the prescience of God. “ I own (says Mr Locke) freely to you the weakness of my understanding, that though it be unquestionable that there is omnipotence and omnisci¬ ence in God our Maker, and though I cannot have a clearer perception of anything than that I am free; yet I cannot make free¬ dom in man consistent with omnipotence and omniscience in God, though I am as fully persuaded of both as of any truth I most firmly assent to ; and therefore I have long since given off the consideration of that question ; resolving all into this short conclusion, that, if it be possible for God to make a free agent, then man is free, though J see not the way of it.""

"It is asserted by a late German writer, that “ Spinoza has been little heard of in England, and not at all in France, and that he has been zealously defended and attacked by Germans alone.” The same writer informs us, that “ the philosophy of Leibnitz has been little studied in France, and not at all in England.”—(Lectures on the History of Literature, by Fred Schlegel. English Transl. published at Fdin. 1818. Vob II. p. 243.) Is it possible that an author who pronounces so dogmatically upon the philosophy of England, should never have heard the name of Dr Clarke ? 4 The Synagogue were so indignant at his apostacy, that they pronounced against him their highest sentence of excom- munication called Schammata. The form of the sentence may be found in the Treatise of Selden, De Jure Naturae et Gentium, Lib. IV. c. 7. It is a document of some curiosity, and will scarcely suffer by a comparison with the Popish form of ex- communication recorded by Sterne.

"145 and began his literary career with a work en¬ titled, Renati Descartes Principiorum Philoso¬ phic, Pars Prima et Secunda, More Geometrico Demonstrate, 1663. It was, however, in little else than his physical principles that he agreed with Descartes; for no two philosophers ever differed more widely in their metaphysical and theological tenets. Fontenelle characterises his system as a {< Cartesianism pushed to extra¬ vagance” (une Cartesianisme outree) ; an expres¬ sion which, although far from conveying a just or adequate idea of the whole spirit of his doctrines, applies very happily to his boldness and pertinacity in following out his avowed principles to the most paradoxical consequences which he conceived them to involve. The re¬ putation of his writings, accordingly, has fallen entirely (excepting perhaps in Germany and in Holland) with the philosophy on which they were grafted; although some of the most ob¬ noxious opinions contained in them are still, from time to time, obtruded on the world, un¬ der the disguise of a new form, and of a phra¬ seology less revolting to modern taste.1 2 3 * In no part of Spinoza’s works has he avowed himself an atheist; hut it will not be disputed, by those who comprehend the drift of his rea¬ sonings, that, in point of practical tendency, Atheism and Spinozism are one and the same","Secunda, Holland","DE,ZA,US",8,"Germany,South Africa,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"In this respect, we may apply to Spinoza (and I may add to Yanini also) what Cicero has said of Epicurus, Verbis reliquit Deos, re sustulit;— a remark which coincides exactly with an ex¬ pression of Newton’s in the Scholium at the end of the Principia: “ Deus sine dominio, provi- dentia, et causis finalibus, nihil aliud est quam Fatum et Natura.”* Among other doctrines of natural and reveal¬ ed religion, which Spinoza affected to embrace, was that of the Divine Omnipresence; a doc¬ trine which, combined with the Plenum of Des¬ cartes, led him, by a short and plausible process of reasoning, to the revival of the old theory which represented God as the sold of the world; or rather to that identification of God and of the material universe, which I take to be still more agreeable to the idea of Spinoza.5 I am particularly anxious to direct the attention of my readers to this part of his system, as I con¬ ceive it to be at present very genei'ally misrepre- 1 “ On vient de proposer a 1’Academie de Berlin, pour sujet de concours: “ Quels sont les points de contact du Car- tdsianisme et du systeme de Spinoza ?”—(Recherches Philosophiques, par M. de Ronald, 1818.) 2 One of the most elaborate and acute refutations of Spinozism which has yet appeared is to be found in Bayle’s Dic¬ tionary, where it is described as “ the most monstrous scheme imaginable, and the most diametrically opposite to the clearest notions of the mind.”—The same author affirms, that ^ it has been fully overthrown even by the weakest of its adversaries.”—“ It does not, indeed, appear possible” (as Mr Maclaurin has observed) “ to invent another system equally absurd; amounting (as it does in fact) to this proposition, that there is but one substance in the universe, endowed with infinite attributes (particularly infinite extension and cogitation), which produces all other things necessarily as its own modifications, and which alone is, in all events, both physical and moral, at once cause and effect, agent and patient—View of Newton's Discoveries, Book I.

"sented, or, at least, very generally misunder¬ stood ; a thing not to he wondered at, consider¬ ing the total neglect into which his works have long fallen. It is only in this way I can ac¬ count for the frequent use which has most un¬ fairly been made of the term Spinozism to stig¬ matise and discredit some doctrines, or rather some modes of speaking, which have been sanc¬ tioned, not only by the wisest of the ancients, hut by the highest names in English philosophy and literature; and which, whether right or wrong, will he found, on a careful examina¬ tion and comparison, not to have the most dis¬ tant affinity to the absurd creed with which they have been confounded. I am afraid that Pope, in the following lines of the Dunciad, suffered himself so far to be misled by the ma¬ lignity of Warhurton, as to aim a secret stab at Newton and Clarke, by associating their figu¬ rative, and not altogether unexceptionable lan¬ guage, concerning space (when they called it the sensorium of the Deity), with the opinion of Spinoza, as I have just explained it.1 “ Thrust some Mechanic Cause into His place, Or bind in matter, or diffuse in space."" Dr Clarke long ago remarked, that “ Believing too much and too little have commonly the luck to meet together, like two things moving contrary ways in the same circle.”—(Third Letter to Dodwell.) A late German writer, who, in his own opinions, has certainly no leaning towards Spinozism, has yet spoken of the mo¬ ral tendency of Spinoza’s writings, in terms of the warmest praise. “ The morality of Spinoza (says M. b red. Schlegel) is not indeed that of the Bible, for he himself was no Christian, but it is still a pure and noble morality, resembling that of the ancient Stoics, perhaps possessing considerable advantages over that system. That which makes him strong when op¬ posed to adversaries who do not understand or feel his depth, or who unconsciously have fallen into errors not much diffe¬ rent from his, is not merely the scientific clearness and decision of his intellect, but in a much higher degree the openhearted¬ ness, strong feeling, and conviction, with which all that he says seems to gush from his heart and soul.’ —(Led. of Fred",Newton,"US,UK,DE",8,"United States,N/A,Germany","North America,N/A,Europe"
"The practical tendency of such doctrines as would pave the way to universal scepticism, by holding up to ridicule the extravagancies and inconsistencies of the learned, is precisely similar. We are told by Tacitus (Jlwwa/. Lib. 14), that Nero was accustomed, at the close of a banquet, to summon a party of philosophers, that he might amuse himself with lis¬ tening to the endless diversity and discordancy of their respective systems: nor were there wanting philosophers at Rome, the same historian adds, who were flattered to be thus exhibited as a spectacle at the table of the Emperor. What a deep and instructive moral is conveyed by this anecdote ! and what a contrast does it afford to the sentiment of one of Nero’s successors, who was himself a philosopher in the best sense of the word, and whose reign furnishes some of the fairest pages in the annals of the human race ! “ I search for truth (says Marcus Antoninus), by whi#h no person has ever been injured.” yao riiv ukrihiav, Us ibiis oruvroli sSxaliti",Rome,US,8,United States,North America

"I have already said, that it seems to have heen the aim of Collins to vindicate the doctrine of Necessity from the reproach brought on it by its supposed alliance with Spinozism ; and to retort upon the partizans of free-will the charges of favouring atheism and immorality. In proof of this I have only to quote the account given by the author himself, of the plan of his work: t( Too much care cannot he taken to prevent being misunderstood and prejudged, in handling questions of such nice speculation as those of Liberty and Necessity; and, therefore, though I might in justice expect to he read before any judgment he passed on me, I think it proper to premise the following observations : “1.

"May I he permitted to observe farther on this head, that, as one of these writers spent his life in the pay of a German prince, and as the other was the favourite philosopher of another sovereign, still more illustrious, the sentiments which they were so anxious to proclaim to the world, may he presumed to have been not very offensive, in their judgments, to the ears of their protectors ? “ All that is must be (says the Baron de Grimm, addressing himself to the Duke of Saxe- Gotha)—all that is must be, even because it is ; this is the only sound philosophy; as long as we do not know this universe a 'priori (as they sav in the schools), all is necessity.1 Liberty is a word without meaning, as you shall see in the letter of M. Diderot.” The following passage is extracted from Di¬ derot’s letter here referred to : “ I am now, my dear friend, going to quit the tone of a preacher, to take, if I can, that of a philosopher.

"Among the many eminent persons who were either driven from France, or who went into voluntary exile, in consequence of the revoca¬ tion of the edict of Nantz, the most illustrious by far was Bayle;8 who, fixing his residence in Holland, and availing himself, to the utmost ex¬ tent, of the religious toleration then enjoyed in that country, diffused from thence, over Europe, a greater mass of accurate and curious informa¬ tion, accompanied by a more splendid display of acute and lively criticism, than had ever before come from the pen of a single individual.3 * * * * Happy ! if he had been able to restrain within due bounds his passion for sceptical and licenti¬ ous discussion, and to respect the feelings of tfie wise and good, on topics connected with religion 1 A reflection of Voltaire’s on the writings of Spinoza may, I think, be here quoted without impropriety. “ Vous etes tres confus, Baruc Spinoza, mais etes vous aussi dangereux qu’on le dit ? Je soutiens que non, et ma raison c’est que vous etes confus, que vous avez dcrit en mauvais Latin, et qu’il n'y a pas dix personnes en Europe qui vous hsent d un bout a I’autre.

Bayle consistoient en quelque peu de Pdripatdtisme, qu’il avoit appris des Je'suites de Toulouse, et un peu de Gartesia- nisme, qu’il n’avoit iamais approfondi.”—(Bib. Choisie, Tom. XII. p. 100.) _ , c „ In the judgment of Gibbon, “ Bavle’s learning was chiefly confined to the Latin authors ; and he had more of a certain multifarious reading than of real erudition. Le Clerc, his great antagonist, was as superior to him in that respect as in^rmr in every other.”—[Extraits Raisonnts de rnes Lectures, p. 62.) 152 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Holland, Toulouse","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"It is not unworthy of notice, that Bayle was the son of a Calvinist minister, and was destin¬ ed by his father for his own profession; that during the course of his education in a college of Jesuits he was converted to the Roman Ca¬ tholic persuasion;1 and that finally he went to Geneva, where, if he was not recalled to the Protestant faith, he was at least most thorough¬ ly reclaimed from the errors of Popery.2 To these early fluctuations in his religious creed, may be ascribed his singularly accurate knowledge of controversial theology, and of the lives and tenets of the most distinguished divines of both churches;—a knowledge much more minute than a person of his talents could well be supposed to accumulate from the mere impulse of literary curiosity. In these respects he ex¬ hibits a striking resemblance to the historian of the Decline and Fall of the Boman Empire: Nor is the parallel between them less exact in the similar effects produced on their minds, by the polemical cast of their juvenile studies. Their common propensity to indulge in indecency is not so easily explicable. In neither does it seem to have originated in the habits of a dissolute youth; but in the wantonness of a polluted and distempered imagination. Bayle, it is well known, led the life of an anchoret ;3 and the li¬ centiousness of his pen is, on that very account, the more reprehensible. But, everything con¬ sidered, the grossness of Gibbon is certainly the more unaccountable, and perhaps the more un¬ pardonable of the two.4 1 “ For the benefit of education, the Protestants were tempted to risk their children in the Catholic Universities ; and in the 22d year of his age young Bayle was seduced by the arts and arguments of the Jesuits of Ihoulouse. Pie remained about seventeen months in their hands a voluntary captive.”—(Gibbon’s Misc. Works, Yol. I. p. 49.) ",Geneva,US,8,United States,North America
"* One of the earliest as well as the ablest of those who undertook a reply to the passages in Bayle which seem to favour Manicheism, candidly acquits him of any serious design to recommend that system to his readers. “ En repondant aux objections Manicheennes, je ne pretends faire aucun tort k M. Bayle : que je ne soup^onne nullement de les favoriser. Je suis persuade qu’il n’a pris la liberte philosophique de dire, en bien des rencontres, le pour et le contre, sans ritn dissimu- ler, que pour donner de I’exercice a ceux qui entendent les matieres qu’il traite, et non pour favoriser ceux dont il explique les raisons.”—(Parrhasiana, ou Pense.es inverses, p. 302, par M.

"depth,1 are to be numbered among the charac- teristical attributes of his genius. Far less does he ever anticipate, by the moral lights of the soul, the slow and hesitating decisions of the un¬ derstanding; or touch with a privileged hand those mysterious chords to which all the social sympathies of our frame are responsive. Had his ambition, however, been more exalted, or his philanthropy more warm and diffusive, he would probably have attempted less than he actually accomplished ; nor would he have stooped to en¬ joy that undisputed pre-eminence which the public voice has now unanimously assigned him, among those inestimable though often ill requit¬ ed authors, whom Johnson has called “ the pioneers of literature.” The suspense of judgment which Bayle’s Dictionary inspires with respect to facts, is, per¬ haps, still more useful than that which it en¬ courages in matters of abstract reasoning. Fon- tenelle certainly went much too far, when he said of history, that it was only a collection of Fables Convenues ;—a most significant and happy phrase, to which I am sorry that I cannot do justice in an English version. But though Fon- tenelle pushed his maxim to an extreme, there is yet a great deal of important truth in the re¬ mark ; and of this I believe every person’s con¬ viction will he stronger, in proportion as his knowledge of men and of books is profound and extensive.2 Of the various lessons of historical scepticism to be learned from Bayle, there is none more practically valuable (more especially in such revolutionary times as we have witnessed) than that which relates to the biographical portraits of distinguished persons, when drawn by their theological and political opponents. In illustra¬ tion of this, I have only to refer to the copious and instructive extracts which he has produced from Roman Catholic writers, concerning the lives, and still more concerning the deaths, of Luther, Knox,5 Buchanan, and various other leaders or partizans of the Reformation. It would be impossible for any well-informed Pro¬ testant to read these extracts, without indulging a smile at their incredible absurdity, if every feeling of levity were not lost in a sentiment of deep indignation at the effrontery and falsehood of their authors. In stating this observation, I have taken my examples from Roman Catholic libellers, without any illiberal prejudices against the members of that church. The injustice done by Protestants to some of the conscientious de¬ fenders of the old faith has been, in all probabi¬ lity, equally great; but this we have no oppor¬ tunity of ascertaining here, by the same direct evidence to which we can fortunately appeal, in vindication of the three characters mentioned above. With the history of two of them every person in this country is fully acquainted; and I have purposely selected them in preference to others, as their names alone are sufficient to cover with disgrace the memory of their calumniators.4 A few years before the death of Bayle, Fon- tenelle began to attract the notice of Europe.5 I class them together on account of the mighty influence of both on the literary taste of their contemporaries; an influence in neither case founded on any claims to original genius, or to important improvements; but on the attractions which they possessed in common, though in very different ways, as popular writers; and on the easy and agreeable access which their works opened to the opinions and speculations of the * I speak of that metaphysical depth which is the exclusive result of what Newton called patient thinking.

"Fontenelle was a nephew of the great Cor¬ neille ; but his genius was, in many respects, very strongly contrasted with that of the author of the Cid. Of this he has himself enabled us to judge by the feeble and unsuccessful attempts in dramatic poetry, by which he was first known to the world. In these, indeed, as in all his productions, there is an abundance of ingenu¬ ity, of elegance, and of courtly refinement; but not the faintest vestige of the mens divinior, or of that sympathy with the higher and nobler passions which enabled Corneille to re-animate and to reproduce on the stage the heroes of an¬ cient Rome. The circumstance, however, which more peculiarly marks and distinguishes his writings, is the French mould in which education and habit seem to have recast all the original features of his mind;—identifying, at the same time, so perfectly the impressions of art with the workmanship of nature, that one would think the Parisian, as well as the man, had started fresh and finished from her creative hand. Even in his Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, the dry discussions with the Marchioness about the now forgotten vortices of Descartes, are en¬ livened throughout by a never-failing spirit of light and national gallantry, which will for ever render them an amusing picture of the manners of the times, and of the character of the author. The gallantry, it must be owned, is often strained and affected; but the affectation sits so well on Fontenelle, that he would appear less easy and graceful without it","Of, Rome","TR,US,FR",8,"Turkey,United States,France","Asia,North America,Europe"
"1 Notice sur la Vie et les Ecrits du Docteur Robertson. (Paris, lb 17-) ! Among the various other respects in which Fontenelle contributed to the intellectual improvement of his countrymen, it ought to be mentioned, that he was one of the first writers in France who diverted the at tention of metaphysicians from the old topics of scholastic discussion, to a philosophical investigation of the principles of the fine arts. Various original hints upon these subjects are scattered over his works: but the most favourable specimens of his talents for this very delicate species of analysis are to be found in his Dissertation on Pastorals, and in his Theory concerning the Delight we derive from Tragedy.* His speculations, indeed, are not always just and satisfactory; but they are seldom deficient in novelty or re¬ finement. Their principal fault, perhaps, arises from the author’s disposition to carry his refinements too far; in con¬ sequence of which, his theories become chargeable with that sort of sublimated ingenuity which the French epithet Alambique expresses more precisely and forcibly than any word in our language",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The authority, however, of this adventurer, who earned his subsistence by collecting and retail¬ ing, for the amusement of a German Prince, the literary scandal of Paris, is not much to be relied on in estimating a character with which he does not appear to have had any opportunity of becoming personally acquainted; more especially as, during Fontenelle’s long decline, the great majority of men of letters in France were dis¬ posed to throw his merits into the shade, as an acceptable homage to the rising and more dazzling glories of Voltaire.1 It is in the Aca¬ demical Memoirs of D’Alembert and Condorcet (neither of whom can be suspected of any un¬ just prejudice against Voltaire, but who were both too candid to sacrifice truth to party feel¬ ings) that we ought to search for Fontenelle’s real portrait:8 Or rather (if it be true, as Dr Hutcheson has somewhere remarked, that “ men have commonly the good or bad quali¬ ties which they ascribe to mankind”) the most faithful Eloge on Fontenelle himself is to be found in those which he has pronounced upon others",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"161 more powerfully than the periodical papers pub¬ lished under various titles by Addison1 and his associates. The effect of these in reclaiming the public taste from the licentiousness and grossness introduced into England at the period of the Restoration ; in recommending the most serious and important truths by the united at¬ tractions of wit, humour, imagination, and elo¬ quence ; and, above all, in counteracting those superstitious terrors which the weak and igno¬ rant are so apt to mistake for religious and moral impressions—has been remarked by numberless critics, and is acknowledged even by those who felt no undue partiality in favour of the authors.8 Some of the papers of Addison, however, are of an order still higher, and bear marks of a mind which, if early and steadily turned to philoso¬ phical pursuits, might have accomplished much more than it ventured to undertake. His fre¬ quent references to the Essay on Human Under¬ standing, and the high encomiums with which they are always accompanied, show how suc¬ cessfully he had entered into the spirit of that work, and how completely he was aware of the importance of its object. The popular nature of his publications, indeed, which rendered it necessary for him to avoid everything that might savour of scholastic or of metaphysical discussion, has left us no means of estimating his philosophical depth, but what are afforded by the results of his thoughts on the particular topics which he has occasion to allude to, and by some of his incidental comments on the scientific merits of preceding authors. But these means are sufficiently ample to justify a very high opinion of his sound and unprejudiced judgment, as well as of the extent and correct¬ ness of his literary information. Of his powers as a logical reasoner he has not enabled us to form an estimate; but none of his contempo¬ raries seem to have been more completely tinc¬ tured with all that is most valuable in the me¬ taphysical and ethical systems of his time.3 But what chiefly entitles the name of Addi¬ son to a place in this Discourse, is his Essays on the Pleasures of Imagination ; the first attempt in England to investigate the principles of the fine arts ; and an attempt which, notwithstand¬ ing many defects in the execution, is entitled to the praise of having struck out a new avenue to the study of the human mind, more alluring than any which had been opened before. In this respect, it forms a most important supple¬ ment to Locke's Survey of the Intellectual Powers ; and it has, accordingly, served as a text, on which the greater part of Locke’s disciples have been eager to offer their comments and their corrections.

"Similar remarks may be extended to the hints suggested by Addison on Wit, on Humour, and on the causes of Laughter. It cannot, indeed, be said of him, that he exhausted any one of these subjects; but he had at least the merit of starting them as problems for the consideration of philosophers ; nor would it be easy to name among his successors, a single writer who has made so important a step towards their solution, as the original proposer",Addison,US,8,United States,North America
"The philosophy of the papers to which the fore¬ going observations refer, has been pronounced to be slight and superficial, by a crowd of modern metaphysicians, who were but ill entitled to erect themselves into judges on such a question.4 The singular simplicity and perspicuity of Addison’s style have contributed much to the prevalence 1 Born in 1672, died in 1719- _ , „ c „ 2 See Pope’s Imitations of Horace, Book II.

"To this simplicity and perspicuity, the wide circulation which his works have so long main¬ tained among all classes of readers, is in a great measure to he ascribed. His periods are not constructed, like those of Johnson, to cc elevate and surprise,” by filling the ear and dazzling the fancy; but we close his volumes with greater reluctance, and return to the perusal of them with far greater alacrity. Franklin, whose fugitive publications on political topics have had so extra¬ ordinary an influence on public opinion, both in the Old and New Worlds, tells us that his style in writing was formed upon the model of Addison: Nor do I know anything in the history of his life which does more honour to his shrewdness and sagacity. The copyist, indeed, did not pos¬ sess the gifted hand of his master,—Museo con- tingens cuncta lepore ; hut such is the effect of his plain and seemingly artless manner, that the most profound conclusions of political economy assume, in his hands, the appearance of indis¬ putable truths; and some of them, which had been formerly confined to the speculative few, are already current in every country of Europe, as proverbial maxims.1 To touch, however slightly, on Addison’s other merits, as a critic, as a wit, as a specula¬ tive politician, and, above all, as a moralist, would lead me completely astray from my pre¬ sent object. It will not he equally foreign to it to quote the two following short passages, which, though not strictly metaphysical, are, both of them, the result of metaphysical habits of thinking, and hear a stronger resemblance than anything I recollect among the wits of Queen Anne’s reign, to the best philosophy of the pre¬ sent age. They approach, indeed, very nearly to the philosophy of Turgot and of Smith","Johnson, Franklin, Addison, Addison",US,8,United States,North America

Almost every degree produces something peculiar to it. The food often grows in one country, and the sauce in another. The fruits of Portugal are corrected by the products of Barhadoes; the infusion of a China plant, sweetened with the pith of an Indian cane. The Philippine Islands give a flavour to our Euro¬ pean bowls. The single dress of a woman of quality is often the product of a hundred cli¬ mates. The muff and the fan come together from the opposite ends of the earth. The scarf is sent from the torrid zone, and the tippet from beneath the pole. The brocade petticoat rises out of the mines of Peru, and the diamond neck¬ lace out of the bowels of Indostan.” But I must not dwell longer on the fascinat¬ ing pages of Addison. Allow me only, before I close them, to contrast the last extract with a remark of Voltaire, which, shallow and con¬ temptible as it is, occurs more than once, both in verse and in prose, in his voluminous writings",Addison,"PT,CN,PE,US,IN",8,"Portugal,China,Peru,United States,India","Europe,Asia,South America,North America,Asia"

It is observed by Akenside, in one of the notes to the Pleasures of Imagination, that c< Philoso¬ phy and the Fine Arts can hardly be conceiv¬ ed at a greater distance from each other than at the Revolution, when Locke stood at the head of one party, and Dryden of the other.” He observes, also, that “ a very great progress to¬ wards their re-union had been made within these few years.” To this progress the chief impxdse was undoubtedly given by Addison and Shaftesbury","Addison, Addison",US,8,United States,North America

A few years before the commencement of these periodical works, a memorable accession was made to metaphysical science, by the pub¬ lication of Berkeley’s New Theory of Vision, and of his Principles of Human Knowledge. Possess¬ ed of a mind which, however inferior to that of Locke in depth of reflection and in soundness of judgment, was fully its equal in logical acute¬ ness and invention, and in learning, fancy, and taste, far its superior,—Berkeley was singularly fitted to promote that re-union of Philosophy and of the Fine Arts which is so essential to the prosperity of both.

"Berkeley, on the other hand, courted the society of all, from whose conversation and manners he could hope to add to the embellishments of his genius; and although himself a decided and High Church Tory,1 lived in habits of friend¬ ship with Steele and Addison, as well as with Pope and Swift. Pope’s admiration of him seems to have risen to a sort of enthusiasm. He yielded to Berkeley’s decision on a very delicate question relating to the exordium of the Essay on Man; and on his moral qualities he has be¬ stowed the highest and most unqualified eulogy to be found in his writings","Berkeley, Addison, Berkeley, Man","US,CI",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire","North America,Africa"

"“ Even in a Bishop I can spy desert; Seeker is decent; Bundle has a heart; Manners with candour are to Benson given; To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven.” With these intellectual and moral endow¬ ments, admired and blazoned as they were by the most distinguished wits of his age, it is not surprising that Berkeley should have given a popularity and fashion to metaphysical pursuits, which they had never before acquired in Eng¬ land. Nor was this popularity diminished by the boldness of some of his paradoxes : on the contrary, it was in no small degree the effect of them; the great bulk of mankind being always prone to mistake a singularity or eccentricity of thinking, for the originality of a creative genius",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"They who wish to study it in detail, will find ample satisfaction, and, if they have any relish for such studies, an inexhaustible fund of enter¬ tainment, in Berkeley’s own short hut masterly exposition of his principles, and in the excellent comments upon it by Smith of Cambridge; by Porterfield; by Beid; and, still more lately, by the author of the Wealth of Nations.1 That this doctrine, with respect to the acquir¬ ed perceptions of sight, was quite unknown to the best metaphysicians of antiquity, we have direct evidence in a passage of Aristotle’s Nico- machian Ethics, where he states the distinction between those endowments which are the imme¬ diate gift of nature, and those which are the fruit of custom and habit. In the former class, he ranks the perceptions of sense, mentioning particularly the senses of seeing and of hearing","Berkeley, Cambridge",US,8,United States,North America
"The passage (which I have transcribed in a Note) is curious, and seems to me decisive on the subject.2 The misapprehensions of the ancients on this very obscure question will not appear surprising, when it is considered, that forty years after the publication of Berkeley’s Theory of Vision, and sixty years after the date of Locke’s Essay, the subject was so imperfectly understood in France, that Condillac (who is, to this day, very gene¬ rally regarded by his countrymen as the father of genuine logic and metaphysics) combated at great length the conclusions of the English phi¬ losophers concerning the acquired perceptions of sight; affirming that “ the eye judges naturally of figures, of magnitudes, of situations, and of 1 By this excellent judge, Berkeley’s New Theory of Vision is pronounced to be “ one of the finest examples of Philoso¬ phical Analysis that is to be found in our own, or any other language.”—(Essays on Philosophical Subjects.

"(Ethic. Nicomach. Lib. ii. cap. 1.) “ For it is not from seeing often, or from hearing often, that we get these senses; but, on the contrary, instead of get¬ ting them by using them, we use them because we have got them.” Had Aristotle been at all aware of the distinction so finely illustrated by Berkeley, instead of appealing to the percep¬ tions of these two senses, as instances of endowments coeval with our birth, he would have quoted them as the most striking of all examples of the effects of custom in apparently identifying our acquired powers with our original faculties",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"It is difficult to suppose, that a person of mature years, who had read and studied Locke and Berkeley with as much care and attention as Condillac appears to have bestowed on them, should have reverted to this ancient and vulgar prejudice; without suspecting that his metaphy¬ sical depth has been somewhat overrated by the world.1 It is but justice, however, to Condillac to add, that, in a subsequent work, he had the candour to acknowledge and to retract his er¬ ror ;—a rare example of that disinterested love of truth, which is so becoming in a philosopher",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"In bestowing the praise of originality on Berkeley’s Theory of Vision, I do not mean to say, that the whole merit of this Theory is ex¬ clusively his own. In this, as in most other cases, it may be presumed, that the progress of the human mind has been gradual : And, in point of fact, it will, on examination, be found, that Berkeley only took up the inquiry where Locke dropped it; following out his principles to their remoter consequences, and placing them in so great a variety of strong and happy lights, as to bring a doctrine till then understood but by a few, within the reach of every intelligent and attentive reader. For my own part, on com¬ paring these two philosophers together, I am at a loss whether most to admire the powerful and penetrating sagacity of the one, or the fertility of invention displayed in the illustrations of the other. What can be more clear and forcible than the statement of Locke quoted in the Note below; and what an idea does it convey of his superiority to Condillac, when it is considered, that he anticipated d priori the same doctrine which was afterwards confirmed by the fine analysis of Berkeley, and demonstrated by the judicious experiments of Cheselden; while the 1 Voltaire, at an earlier period, had seized completely the scope of Berkeley’s theory ; and had explained it with equal brevity and precision, in the following passage of his Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy:— “ II faut absolument conclure, que les distances, les grandeurs, les situations ne sont pas, a proprement parler, des choses visibles, c’est a dire, ne sont pas les objets propres et immediats de la vue. L’objet propre et immediat de la vue n’esi autre chose que la lumiere coloree: tout le reste, nous ne le sentons qu’a la longue et par experience. Nous apprenons a voir, precisement comme nous apprenons h parler et a lire. La difference est, que 1’art de voir est plus facile, et que la nature est egalement h tous notre maitre","Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America
"“ Les jugemens soudains, presque uniformes, que toutes nos ames a un certain age portent des distances, des grandeurs, des situations, nous font penser, qu’il n’y a qu’h. ouvrir les yeux pour voir la maniere dont nous voyons. On se trompe, il y faut le secours des autres sens. Si les hommes n’avoient que le sens de la vue, ils n’auroient aucun moyen pour con- noitre 1’etendue en longeur, largeur et profondeur, et un pur esprit ne la connoitroit peut-etre, a moins que Dieu ne la lui rdve'lat.”—Phys. Newton, Chap. 7",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"French metaphysician, with all this accumula¬ tion of evidence before him, relapsed into a pre¬ judice transmitted to modern times, from the very infancy of optical science !1 I believe it would he difficult to produce from any writer prior to Locke, an equal number of im¬ portant facts relating to the intellectual phenome¬ na, as well observed, and as unexceptionahly de¬ scribed, as those which I have here brought under my reader’s eye. It must appear evident, besides, to all who have studied the subject, that Locke has, in this passage, enunciated, in terms the most precise and decided, the same general con¬ clusion concerning the effect of constant and early habits, which it was the great object of Berkeley’s Theory of Vision to establish, and which, indeed, gives to that work its chief value, when considered in connection with the Philo¬ sophy of the Human Mind",Berkeley,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Berkeley himself, it is to he observed, by no means lays claim to that complete novelty in his Theory of Vision, which has been ascribed to it by many who, in all probability, derived their whole information concerning it from the traditional and inexact transcripts of book-mak¬ ing historians. In the introductory sentences of his Essay, he states very clearly and candid¬ ly the conclusions of his immediate predecessors on this class of our perceptions; and explains, with the greatest precision, in what particulars his own opinion differs from theirs. “ It is, I think, agreed by all, that distance, of itself, can¬ not be seen. For distance being a line directed end-wise to the eye, it projects only one point in the fund of the eye, which point remains in¬ variably the same, whether the distance be longer or shorter “ I find it also acknowledged, that the esti¬ mate we make of the distance of objects consi¬ derably remote, is rather an act of judgment grounded on experience, than of sense. For ex¬ ample, when I perceive a great number of inter¬ mediate objects, sucli as houses, fields, rivers, and the like, which I have experienced to take i “ We are farther to consider,” says Locke, “ concerning perception, that the ideas we receive by sensation are often in grown people altered by the judgment, without our taking notice of it. When we set before our eyes a round globe, of any uniform colour, v. g. gold, alabaster, or jet, it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted in our mind is of a flat circle, va¬ riously shadowed, with several degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we having by use been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are wont to make in us, what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figure of bodies; the judgment presently, by an habitual custom, alters the appear¬ ances into their causes, so that, from what truly is variety of shadow or colour, collecting the figure it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames to itself the perception of a convex figure, and an uniform colour ; when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured, as is evident in painting. * * * * “ But this is not, I think, usual in any of our ideas, but those received by sight ;* because sight, the most comprehensive of all our senses, conveying to our minds the ideas of lights and colours, which are peculiar only to that sense ; and also the far different ideas of space, figure, or motion, the several varieties whereof change the appearances of its proper objects, viz. light and colours, we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other. This, in many cases, by a settled habit in things whereof we have frequent experience, is performed so constantly and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea formed by our judgment; so that one, viz. that of sensation, serves only to excite the other, and is scarce taken notice of itself: as a man who reads or hears with attention or understanding, takes little notice of the characters or sounds, but of the ideas that are excited in him by them",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"“ There is another way mentioned by the optic writers, whereby they will have us judge of those distances, in respect of which the breadth of the pupil hath any sensible bigness; and that is, the greater or less divergency of the rays, which, issuing from the visible point, do fall on the pupil; that point being judged nearest, which is seen by most diverging rays, and that remoter, which is seen by less diver¬ ging rays.” These (according to Berkeley) are the “ com¬ mon and current accounts” given by mathema¬ ticians of our perceiving near distances by sight",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"He then proceeds to show, that they are unsa¬ tisfactory ; and that it is necessary, for the so¬ lution of this problem, to avail ourselves of prin¬ ciples borrowed from a higher philosophy : Af¬ ter which, he explains, in detail, his own theory concerning the ideas (sensations) which, by ex¬ perience, become signs of distance;1 2 * or (to use his own phraseology) “ by which distance is suggested* to the mind.” The result of the whole is, that, “ a man boi-n blind, being made to see, would not at first have any idea of dis¬ tance by sight. The sun and stars, the remotest objects as well as the nearest, would all seem to be in his Eye, or rather in his Mind.”* From this quotation it appears, that, before Berkeley’s time, philosophers had advanced greatly beyond the point at which Aristotle stopped, and towards which Condillac, in his first publication, made a retrograde movement. Of this progress some of the chief steps may be traced as early as the twelfth century in the Optics of Alhazen ;4 and they may be perceived still more clearly and distinctly in various op¬ tical writers since the revival of letters; parti¬ cularly in the Optica Promota of James Gre¬ gory. 5 Father Malebranche went still farther, and even anticipated some of the metaphysical i \ Tn°r assi?ting persons unaccustomed to metaphysical studies to enter into the spirit and scope of Berkeley’s Theory, the best illustration I know of is furnished by the phenomena of the Phantasmagoria. It is sufficient to hint at this application ot these phenomena, to those who know anything of the subject. r 2 The word suggest is much used by Berkeley, in this appropriate and technical sense, not only in his Theory of Visioti, but m his Principles of Human Knowledge, and in his Minute Philosopher. It expresses, indeed, the cardinal principle on which his Theory o/1 Vision hinges; and is now so incorporated with some of our best metaphysical speculations, that one cannot easily conceive how the use of it was so long dispensed with. Locke (in the passage quoted in the Note, p. 107.) uses the word excite for the same purpose; but it seems to imply an hypothesis concerning the mechanism of the mind, and by no means expresses the fact in question with the same force and precision","Berkeley, Of, Berkeley, Berkeley","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"It is remarkable, that Dr lleid should have thought it incumbent on him to apologise for introducing into philosophy a word so familiar to every person conversant with Berkeley’s works. “ I beg leave to make use of the word suggestion be¬ cause I know not one more proper to express a power of the mind, which seems entirely to have escaped the notice of'phi¬ losophers, and to which we owe many of our simple notions which are neither impressions nor ideas, as well as many origi¬ nal principles of belief. I shall endeavour to explain, by an example, what I understand by this word. We all know that a certain kind of sound suggests immediately to the mind a coach passing in the street; and not only produces the imagina¬ tion, but the belief, that a coach is passing. Yet there is no comparing of ideas, no perception of agreements or disagree¬ ments to produce this belief; nor is there the least similitude between the sound we hear, and the coach we imagine and believe to be passing.” 8 So far Dr Reid’s use of the word coincides exactly with that of Berkeley ; but the former will be found to annex to it a meaning more extensive than the latter, by employing it to comprehend not only those intimations which are the result of experience and habit; but another class of intimations (quite overlooked by Berkeley), those which result from the original trame or the human mind.—(See Reid’s Inquiry, chap. ii. sect. 7*) I request the attention of my readers to this last sentence, as I have little doubt that the fact here stated gave rise to tne theory which Berkeley afterwards adopted, concerning the non-existence of the material world. It is not, indeed, sur¬ prising that a conclusion, so very curious with respect to the objects of sight, should have been, in the first ardour of dis¬ covery, too hastily extended to those qualities also which are the appropriate obiects of touch","Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America
"reasonings of Berkeley concerning tlie means by which experience enables us to judge of the dis¬ tances of near objects. In proof of this, it is sufficient to mention the explanation he gives of the manner in which a comparison ot the percep¬ tions of sight and of touch teaches us giadually to estimate by the eye the distances of all those objects which are within reach of our hands, or of which we are accustomed to measure the dis¬ tance, by walking over the intermediate ground",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"In rendering this justice to earlier writers, I have no wish to detract from the originality of Berkeley. With the single exception, indeed, of the passage in Malehranche which I have just referred to, and which it is more than pro¬ bable was unknown to Berkeley when his theory first occurred to him,1 I have ascribed to his predecessors nothing more than what he has himself explicitly acknowledged to belong to them. All that I wished to do was, to supply some links in the historical chain, which he has omitted","Berkeley, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America
"Next in point of importance to Berkeley’s New Theory of Vision, which I regard as by far the most solid basis of his philosophical fame, may be ranked his speculations concerning the Objects of General Terms, and his celebrated argument against the existence of the Material World",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"On both of these questions I have elsewhere ex¬ plained my own ideas so fully, that it would be quite superfluous for me to resume the consi¬ deration of them here.2 3 In neither instance are his reasonings so entirely original as has been commonly supposed. In the former, they co¬ incide in substance, although with immense im¬ provements in the form, with those of the scho¬ lastic nominalists, as revived and modified by Hobbes and Leibnitz. In the latter instance, they amount to little more than an ingenious and elegant development of some principles of Malebranche, pushed to certain paradoxical but obvious consequences, of which Malebranche, though unwilling to avow them, appears to have been fully aware. These consequences, too, had been previously pointed out by Mr Norris, a very learned divine of the church of England, whose name has unaccountably failed in obtain¬ ing that distinction to which his acuteness as a logician, and his boldness as a theorist, justly entitled him!5 The great object of Berkeley, in maintaining his system of idealism, it may be proper to re¬ mark in passing, was to cut up by the roots the scheme of materialism. “ Matter (he tells us himself) being once expelled out qf nature, drags with it so many sceptical and impious notions",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"* * * * Without it your Epicureans, Hobbists, and the like, have not even the shadow of a pretence, but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world.” Not satisfied with addressing these abstract speculations to the learned, Berkeley conceived them to be of such moment to human happiness, that he resolved to bring them, if possible, with¬ in the reach of a wider circle of readers, by throwing them into the more popular and amu¬ sing form of dialogues.4 The skill with which 1 Berkeley’s Theory was published when he was only twenty-five ; an age when it can scarcely be supposed that his me¬ taphysical reading had been very extensive","Berkeley, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America
"3 Another very acute metaphysician of the same church (Arthur Collier, author of a Demonstration of t ic Non-cxis ence and Impossibility of an External World) has met with still greater injustice. His name is not to be found in any ot our Bio¬ graphical Dictionaries. In point of date, his publication is some years posterior to that of A orris, and there oie i oes no possess the same claims to originality ; but it is far superior to it in logical closeness and precision, and is not obscured o the same degree with the mystical theology which Norris (after the example ol Malebranche) connected wit le sc erne of Idealism. Indeed, when compared with the writings of Berkeley himself, it yields to them less m force o argumen , than in composition and variety of illustration.

"169 he has executed this very difficult and unpro¬ mising task cannot be too much admired. The characters of his speakers are strongly marked and happily contrasted; the illustrations exhibit a singular combination of logical subtlety and of poetical invention; and the style, while it every¬ where abounds with the rich, yet sober colour¬ ings of the author’s fancy, is perhaps superior, in point of purity and of grammatical correct¬ ness, to any English composition of an earlier date.1 The impression produced in England by Berkeley’s Idealism was not so great as might have been expected; but the novelty of his pa¬ radoxes attracted very powerfully the attention of a set of young men who were then prose¬ cuting their studies at Edinburgh, and who formed themselves into a society for the express purpose of soliciting from the author an expla¬ nation of some parts of his theory which seemed to them obscurely or equivocally expressed. To this correspondence the amiable and excellent prelate appears to have given every encourage¬ ment ; and I have been told by the best autho¬ rity, that he was accustomed to say, that his reasonings had been nowhere better understood than by this club of young Scotsmen.2 The in¬ genious Dr Wallace, author of the Discourse on the Numbers of Mankind, was one of the leading members; and with him were associated several other individuals whose names are now well known and honourably distinguished in the learned world. Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, which was published in 1739, affords sufficient evidence of the deep impression which Berkeley’s writings had left upon his mind; and to this juvenile essay of Mr Hume’s may be traced the origin of the most important meta¬ physical works which Scotland has since pro¬ duced","Berkeley, Edinburgh, Berkeley","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"Among the immediate predecessors of Hart¬ ley, Dr Law, afterwards Bishop of Carlisle, 1 Dr Warton, after bestowing high praise on the Minute Philosopher, excepts from his encomium “ those passages in the iourth dialogue, where the author has introduced his fanciful and whimsical opinions about vision.” (Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope, Vol. II. p. 264.)—If I were called on to point out the most ingenious and original part of the whole work, it would be the argument contained in the passages here so contemptuously alluded to by this learned and (on all questions of taste) most respectable critic",Carlisle,US,8,United States,North America
"The other principle on which this theory pro¬ ceeds (that of the vibrations and vibratiuncles in the medullary substance of the brain) is also of Cambridge origin. It occurs in the form of a query in Sir Isaac Newton’s Optics; and a distinct allusion to it, as a principle likely to throw new light on the phenomena of mind, is to be found in the concluding sentence of Smith’s Harmonies","Cambridge, Newton",US,8,United States,North America

"175 the rest. But this difficulty arises merely from his own peculiar and paradoxical theory about the artificial origin of society; a theory which needs no refutation, but the short and luminous aphorism of Montesquieu, that “ man is born in society, and there he remains.” The other dif¬ ficulties touched upon by Rousseau, in the for¬ mer part of this quotation, are much more se¬ rious, and have never yet been removed in a manner completely satisfactory: And hence some very ingenious writers have been led to conclude, that language could not possibly have been the work of human invention. This ar¬ gument has been lately urged with much acute¬ ness and plausibility by Dr Magee of Dublin, and by M. de Bonald of Paris.1 It may, how¬ ever, be reasonably questioned, if these philoso¬ phers would not have reasoned more logically, had they contented themselves with merely af¬ firming, that the problem has not yet been solv¬ ed, without going so far as to pronounce it to n be absolutely insolvable. For my own part, when I consider its extreme difficulty, and the short space of time during which it has engaged the attention of the learned, I am more dispos¬ ed to wonder at the steps which have been al¬ ready gained in the research, than at the num¬ ber of desiderata which remain to employ the ingenuity of our successors. It is justly re¬ marked by Dr Ferguson, that, “ when language has attained to that perfection to which it ar¬ rives in the progress of society, the speculative mind, in comparing the first and the last stages of the progress, feels the same sort of amaze¬ ment with a traveller, who, after rising insen¬ sibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look down from a precipice, to the summit of which he scarcely believes he could have ascended with¬ out supernatural aid.”2 With respect to some of the difficulties point¬ ed out by Rousseau and his commentators, it may be here remarked in passing (and the ob¬ servation is equally applicable to various pas¬ sages in Mr Smith’s dissertation on the same subject), that the difficulty of explaining the theory of any of our intellectual operations af¬ fords no proof of any difficulty in applying that operation to its proper practical purpose; nor is the difficulty of explaining the metaphysical nature of any part of speech a proof, that, in its first origin, it implied any extraordinary effort of intellectual capacity. How many metaphy¬ sical difficulties might be raised about the ma¬ thematical notion of a line ? And yet this notion is perfectly comprehended by every peasant, when he speaks of the distance between two places; or of the length, breadth, or height of his cottage. In like manner, although it may be difficult to give a satisfactory account of the origin and import of such words as of or by, we ought not to conclude, that the invention of them implied any metaphysical knowledge in 1 The same theory has been extended to the art of writing; but if this art was first taught to man by an express reve¬ lation from Heaven, what account can be given of its present state in the great empire of China ?

To this observation may be added, by way of com¬ ment, the following reflections of one of the most learned prelates of the English church :—“ Man, we are told, had a lan¬ guage from the beginning; for he conversed with God, and gave to every animal its particular name. But how came man by language ? He must either have had it from inspiration, ready formed from his Creator, or have derived it by the exer¬ tion of those faculties of the mind, which were implanted in him as a rational creature, from natural and external objects with which he was surrounded. Scripture is silent on the means by which it was acquired. We are not, therefore, war¬ ranted to affirm, that it was received by inspiration, and there is no internal evidence in language to lead us to such a sup¬ position. On this side, then, of the question, we have nothing but uncertainty; but on a subject, the causes of which are so remote, nothing is more convenient than to refer them to inspiration, and to recur to that easy and comprehensive argu¬ ment, Ails irsXusro (houXn' that is, man enjoyed the great privilege of speech, which distinguished him at first, and still continues to distinguish him as a rational creature, so eminently from the brute creation, without exerting those reasoning faculties, by which he was in other respects enabled to raise himself so much above their level.

It is farther remarked very sagaciously, and I think very decisively, by the same author, that “ the supposition of man having received a language ready formed from his Creator, is actually inconsistent with the evidence of the origin of our ideas, which exists in language For, as the origin of our ideas is to be traced in the words through which the ideas are conveyed, so the origin oflanguage is referable to the source from whence our (first) ideas are derived, namely, nature1 and external objects.”—(Ibid. pp. 83, 84.) 176 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Dublin, Paris, Man, Oxford","US,CN,CI,UK",8,"United States,China,Côte d'Ivoire,N/A","North America,Asia,Africa,N/A"

Nor will this appear surprising, when we consider how impossible it is for us to judge, from our own experience, of the intellectual processes which pass in the minds of savages. Some instincts, we know, possessed both by them and by infants (that ot imitation, for example, and the use of natural signs), disappear in by far the greater number of in¬ dividuals, almost entirely in the maturity of their reason. It does not seem at all improbable, that other instincts connect¬ ed with the invention ot speech, may be confined to that state of the intellectual powers which requires their guidance: nor is it quite impossible, that some latent capacities of the understanding may be evolved by the pressure of necessity","Providence, VAn, Paris","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"

"3 Rousseau—In a work by Hdrault de Sechelles (entitled Voyages a Montbar, contemnt des details trh interessans sur le caractere, la persunne, et les ecrits de Buffon, Paris, 1801), a very different idea of his religious creed is given from that which I have ascribed to him ; but, in direct opposition to this statement, we have a letter, dictated by Buffon, on his death-bed, to Madame Necker, in return for a present of her husband’s book, On the Importance of Religious Opinions. The letter (we are told) is in the hand-writing of Buffon’s son, who describes his father as then too weak to hold the pen.—(Melanges ex¬ traits des Manuscrits de Madame Necker. 3 Vols. Paris, 1788.) The sublime address to the Supreme Being, with which Buffon closes his reflections on the calamities of war, seems to breathe the very soul of Fenelon. “ Grand Dieu ! dont la seule presence soutient la nature et maintient 1’harmonie des loix de I’univers,” &c. &c. &,c DISSERTATION FIRST","Paris, Paris",US,8,United States,North America

"“But as of all animals man is the wisest, so hands are well fitted for the purposes of a wise animal. For it is not because he had hands that he is therefore wiser than the rest, as An¬ axagoras alleged; hut because he was wiser than the rest that he had therefore hands, as Aris¬ totle has most wisely judged. Neither was it his hands, hut his reason, which instructed man in the arts. The hands are only the organs by which the arts are practised.” 3 The contrast, in point of elevation, between the tone of French philosophy, and that of the best heathen moralists, was long ago remarked by Addison; and of this contrast it would be difficult to find a better illustration than the passages which have just been quoted",Addison,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"For if all the sources of our knowledge are to he found in the external senses, how is it possible for the human mind to rise to a conception of the Supreme Being, or to that of any other truth either of natural or of revealed religion ? To this question Gassendi and Condillac, it cannot be doubted, were both able to return an answer, which seemed to themselves abundantly satisfactory. But how few of the multitude are competent to enter into these refined explana¬ tions ? And how much is it to be dreaded, that the majority will embrace, with the general prin¬ ciple, all the more obvious consequences which to their own gross conceptions it seems neces¬ sarily to involve ? Something of the same sort may be remarked in the controversy about the freedom of the human will. Among the multi¬ tudes whom Leibnitz and Edwards have made converts to the scheme of necessity, how com¬ paratively inconsiderable is the number who have acquiesced in their subtle and ingenious attempts to reconcile this scheme with man’s ac¬ countableness and moral agency ? Of the prevalence of atheism at Paris, among the higher classes, at the period of which we are now speaking, the Memoires and Correspondance of the Baron de Grimm afford the most unques¬ tionable proofs.3 His friend Diderot seems to have been one of its most zealous abettors; who, 1 The Abb^ Trublet in the Mercure de Juillet, 1757 (See CEuvres de Fontenelle, Tome II. p. 137. Amsterdam, 17b‘4.) 2 In La Fontaine’s Discours d Madame de la Sabliere (Liv. X. Fable I.), the good sense with which he points out the ex¬ travagance of both these extremes is truly admirable. His argument (in spite of the fetters of rhyme) is stated, not only with his usual grace, but with singular clearness and precision ; and considering the period when he wrote, reflects much honour on his philosophical sagacity","Of, Paris, Amsterdam, Fontaine","US,TR,FR",8,"United States,Turkey,France","North America,Asia,Europe"
"On this subject many of our English writers have been misled by taking for granted that to speak lightly of final causes is, of itself, sufficient proof of atheism. That this is a very rash as well as uncharitable conclusion, no other proof is necessary than the manner in which final causes are spoken of by Descartes himself, the great object of whose metaphysical writings plainly was, to establish by demonstration the existence of God. The following vindication of this part of the Cartesian philosophy has been lately offered by a French divine, and it may be extended with equal justice to Buffon and many others of Descartes’s successors : “ Quelques au¬ teurs, et particulierement Leibnitz, ont critique cette partie de la doctrine de Descartes; mais nous la croyons irreprochable, si on veut bien 1’entendre, et remarquer que Descartes ne parle que des Fins totales de Dieu. Sans doute, le soleil par exemple, et les etoiles, ont ete faits pour 1’homme, dans ce sens, que Dieu, en les creant, a eu en vue Futilite de I’homme ; et cette utility a ete sa fin. Mais cette utilite a-t-elle ete 1’unique fin de Dieu ? Croit-on qu’en lui attribuant d’autres fins, on affoibliroit la re- connoissance de I’homme, et 1’obligation ou il est de louer et de benir Dieu dans toutes ses oeuvres ? Les auteurs de la vie spirituelle, les plus mystiques meme, et les plus accr^dites, ne 1’ont pas cru.”—(M. 1’Abbe Emery, Editor of the Thoughts of Descartes upon Religion and Mo¬ rals, Paris, 1811, p. TO.) As to the unqualified charge of atheism, which has been brought by some French ecclesiastics against all of their countrymen that have pre¬ sumed to differ from the tenets of the Catholic church, it will be admitted, with large allow¬ ances, by every candid Presbyterian, when it is recollected that something of the same illiberali- ty formerly existed under the comparatively enlightened establishment of England. In the present times, the following anecdote would ap¬ pear incredible, if it did not rest on the unques¬ tionable testimony of Dr Jortin: “ I heard Dr B. say in a sermon, if any one denies the unin¬ terrupted succession of bishops, I shall not scruple to call him a downright atheist. This, when I was young (Jortin adds), was sound, orthodox, and fashionable doctrine.”—(Tracts, Yol. I. p. 486.)2 How far the effects of that false philosophy of which Grimm’s correspondence exhibits so dark and so authentic a picture, were connected with the awful revolution which soon after followed, it is not easy to say. That they contributed greatly to blacken its atrocities, as well as to re¬ volt against it the feelings of the whole Chris¬ tian world, cannot be disputed. The experi¬ ment was indeed tremendous, to set loose the passions of all classes of men from the restraints attention, as it contains some very remarkable marginal notes on the Christianisme Devoile, copied from Voltaire’s own handwriting",Paris,"US,UK,FR",8,"United States,N/A,France","North America,N/A,Europe"
"Since writing the above note, I have seen the Memoirs of M. Suard, by M. Garat (Paris, 1820), in which the biographer, whose authority on this point is perfectly decisive, ascribes with confidence to Baron d’Holbach the Systeme de la Nature, and also a work entitled La Morale et La Legislation Universelle (Yol. I. pp. 210, 211.) According to the same author, the Baron d’Holbach was one of Diderot’s proselytes—(LUd. p. 208.) His former creed, it would appear, had been very different",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"Of the levity and extravagance with which such charges have sometimes been brought forward, we have a remarkable instance in a tract entitled Athei Detecti, by a very learned Jesuit Father Hardouin ; (see his Opera Varia Posthuma, Amsterdam, 1733, in fob) where, among a number of other names, are to be found those of Jansenius, Descartes, Malebranche, Arnauld, Nicole, and Pascal. Large additions on grounds equally frivolous, have been made in later times, to this list, by authors, who having themselves made profession of Atheism, were anxious, out of vanity, to swell the number of their sect. Of this kind was a book published at Paris, under some of the revolutionary governments, by Pierre Sylvain Marechal, en¬ titled Dictionnaire des Athecs. Here we meet with the names of St Chrysostom, St Augustin, Pascal, Bossuet, Fenelon, Bellarmin, Labruyere, Leibnitz, and many others not less unexpected. This book he is said to have published at the suggestion of the celebrated astronomer Lalande, who afterwards published a supplement to the Dictionary, supplying the omissions of the author.

"Every body that has children should read it more than once; for though it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity, though his general scheme of education he an impracticable chimera, yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths better expressed than ever they were before, that may be of service to the wisest men. Particularly, I think he has observed children with more attention, knows their mean¬ ing, and the working of their little passions, better than any other writer. As to his religi¬ ous discussions, which have alarmed the world, and engaged their thoughts more than any other parts of his book, I set them all at nought, and wish they had been omitted.”—(Gray’s Works by Mason, Letter 49.) The most valuable additions made by French writers to the Philosophy of the Human Mind are to be found, not in their systematical trea¬ tises on metaphysics, but in those more popu¬ lar compositions, which, professing to paint the prevailing manners of the times, touch occasionally on the varieties of intellectual character. In this most interesting and im¬ portant study, which has been hitherto almost entirely neglected in Great Britain,1 France must be allowed not only to have led the way, but to remain still unrivalled. It would be endless to enumerate names; hut I must not pass over those of Vauvenargues2 and Du- sur la secrete tendance de toutes ces opinions, lea ont soumises a un examen plus severe.

It does not seem to have engaged the curiosity of Mr Hume in so great a degree as might have been expected from his habits of observation and extensive intercourse with the world. The objects of Dr Reid’s inquiries led him into a totallv different track. . , . . „ . , Among German writers, Leibnitz has occasionally glanced with a penetrating eye at the varieties of genius; and it were to be wished that he had done so more frequently. How far his example has been followed by his countrymen in later times, I am unable to judge, from my ignorance of their language. ^ t _ u A work expressly on this subject was published by a Spanish physician (Huarte) in the seventeenth century.

"After what has been already said of tbe general tone of French philosophy, it will not appear surprising, that a system so mystical and spiritual as that of Leibnitz never struck its roots deeply in that country. A masterly out¬ line of its principles was published by Madame du Chatelet, at a period of her life when she was an enthusiastic admirer of the author; and a work on such a subject, composed by a lady of her rank and genius, could not fail to pro¬ duce at first a very strong sensation at Paris; but not long after, she herself abandoned the sais si sa conversation n’avait pas meme quelque chose de plus animd, de plus delicat que ses divins ecrits.” And, on a different occasion, he speaks of him thus: “ Doux, sensible, compatissant, il tenait nos ames dans ses mains.

"German philosophy, and became a zealous partizan of the Newtonian school. She even translated into French, and enriched with a commentary, the Principia of Newton ; and by thus renouncing her first faith, contributed more to discredit it, than she had previously done to bring it into fashion. Since that time, Leibnitz has had few, if any, disciples in France, al¬ though some of his peculiar tenets have oc¬ casionally found advocates there, among those who have rejected the great and leading doc¬ trines, by which his system is more peculiarly characterised. His opinions and reasonings in particular, on the necessary concatenation of all events, both physical and moral (which accord¬ ed hut too well with the philosophy professed by Grimm and Diderot), have been long incor¬ porated with the doctrines of the French ma¬ terialists, and they have been lately adopted and sanctioned, in all their extent, by an au¬ thor, the unrivalled splendour of whose ma¬ thematical genius may be justly suspected, in the case of some of his admirers, to throw a false lustre on the dark shades of his philosophi¬ cal creed.1 Notwithstanding, however, this important and unfortunate coincidence, no two systems can well be imagined more strongly contrasted on the whole, than the lofty metaphysics of Leibnitz, and that degrading theory concerning the origin of our ideas, which has been fashion¬ able in France since the time of Condillac. In proof of this, I have only to refer to the account of both, which has been already given",Newton,"FR,US,DE",8,"France,United States,Germany","Europe,North America,Europe"

"This, indeed, is studiously kept by the author out of the reader’s view ; and hence the facility with which some of his propositions have been admitted by many of his mathematical disciples, who, it is highly probable, were not aware of the consequences which they necessarily involve. _ _ , I cannot conclude this note without recurring to an observation ascribed in the above quotation from Laplace to Leib¬ nitz, “ that the blind chance of the Epicureans involves the supposition of an effect taking place without a cause. Phis, I apprehend, is a very incorrect statement of the philosophy taught by Lucretius, which nowhere gives the slightest coun¬ tenance to such a supposition. The distinguishing tenet of this sect was, that the order of the universe does not imply the existence of intelligent causes, but may be accounted for by the active powers belonging to the atoms of matter; which ac¬ tive powers, being exerted through an indefinitely long period of time, might produce, nay, must have, produced, exactly such a combination of things, as that with which we are surrounded. This, it is evident, does not call in question the ne¬ cessity of a cause to produce every effect, but, on the contrary, virtually assumes the truth of that axiom. It only excludes from these causes the attribute of intelligence. It is in the same way when I apply the words blind chance (hazard aveugle) to the throw of a die, I do not mean to deny that I am ultimately the cause of the particular event that is to take place; but only to intimate that I do not here act as a designing cause, in consequence of my ignorance of the various accidents to which the die is subjected, while shaken in the box. If I am not mistaken, this Epicurean Theory approaches very nearly to the scheme, which it is the main object of the Essay on Probabilities to inculcate; and, therefore,, it was not quite fair .in Laplace to object to the supposition of man’s free agency, as favouring those principles which he himself was labouring in¬ directly to insinuate","Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America

Ancillon’s literary connections both with France and with Germany entitle his opinions on the respective merits of their philosophi¬ cal systems to peculiar weight. If he anywhere discovers a partiality for either, the modest account which he gives of himself would lead us to expect his leaning to be in favour of his countrymen. “ Placd entre la France et PAllemagne, appartenant a la premiere par la langue dans laquelle je hasarde d’dcrire, a la seconde par ma naissance, mes etudes, mes principes, mes affections, et j’ose le dire, par la couleur de ma pensde, je desirerois pouvoir servir de mediateur litte'raire, ou d’interprete philosophique entre les deux nations.” In translating from M. Ancillon the passage quoted in the text, I have adhered as closely as possible to the words of the original; although I cannot help imagining that I could have rendered it still more intelligible to the English reader by laying aside some of the peculiarities of his German phraseology.

Wolfius, indeed, did not profess to follow implicitly the opinions of his master, and, on some points, laid claim to peculiar ideas of his own; but the spirit of his philosophy is essen¬ tially the same with that of Leibnitz,5 and the particulars in which he dissented from him are too trifling to deserve any notice in the history of literature.4 The high reputation so long maintained by Wolfius in Germany suggested, at different times, to the book-makers at Paris, the idea of intro¬ ducing into France the philosophy which he taught. Hence a number of French abridg¬ ments of his logical and metaphysical writings",Paris,"FR,DE,US",8,"France,Germany,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"When the system of Pre-established Harmony was first introduced by Wolfius into the University of Halle, it excited an alarm which had very nearly been attended with fatal consequences to the professor. The following anecdote on the subject is told by Euler: “ Lorsque du temps du feu Hoi de Prusse, M. Wolf enseignoit a Halle le systeme de 1’Har- monie Pre-etablie, le Boi s’informa de cette doctrine, qui faisoit grand bruit alors ; et un courtisan repondit a sa Majeste, que tous les soldats, selon cette doctrine, n’etoient que des machines; que quand il en desertoit, c’etoit une suite ndcessaire de leur structure, et qu’on avoit tort par consequent de les punir, comme on 1’auroit si on punissoit une machine pour avoir produit tel ou tel mouvement. Le Hoi se facha si fort sur ce rapport, qu’il donna ordre de chasser M. Wolf de Halle, sous peine d’etre pendu s’il s’y trouvoit au bout de 24 heurs. Le philosophe se refugia alors a Marbourg, oil je lui ai parle peu de temps apres (Lettres a une Princesse d'Allemagne, Lettre 84me.) We are informed by Condorcet, that some reparation was afterwards made for this injustice by Frederic the Great—“ Le lloi de Prusse, qui necroit pas pourtant a 1’Harmonie Pre-etablie, s’est empresse de rendre justice a Wolf des le premier jour de son regne.” 4 Among other novelties affected by Wolfius, was a new modification of the Theory of the Monads. A slight outline of it, but quite sufficient, I should suppose, to gratify the curiosity of most readers, may be found in Euler’s Letters to a German Princess","University, Halle, Halle","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"189 From the time of Wolfius till the philosophy of Kant began to attract general notice, I know of no German metaphysician whose speculations seem to have acquired much celebrity in the learned world.1 Lambert® is perhaps the most illustrious name which occurs during this inter¬ val. As a mathematician and natural philoso¬ pher, his great merits are universally known and acknowledged, but the language in which his metaphysical and logical works were written, has confined their reputation within a compa¬ ratively narrow circle. I am sorry that I can¬ not speak of these from my own knowledge; but I have heard them mentioned in terms of the highest praise, by some very competent judges, to whose testimony I am disposed to give the greater credit, from the singular vein of originality which runs through all his mathe¬ matical and physical publications.3 The Critique of Pure Reason (the most cele¬ brated of Kant’s metaphysical works) appeared in 1781.4 The idea annexed to the title by the author, is thus explained by himself: “ Criti- cam rationis purse non dico censuram librorum et Systematum, sed facultatis rationalis in uni- versum, respectu cognitionum omnium, ad quas, ab omni experientia libera, possit anniti, proinde dijudicationem possibilitatis aut impossibilitatis metaphysices in genere, constitutionemque turn fontium, turn ambitus atque compagis, turn vero terminorum illius, sed cuncta haec ex princi- piis.” ( Kantii, Opera ad Pkilosophiam Criticam., Vol. I. Prsefatio Auctoris Prior, pp. 11, 12.) To render this somewhat more intelligible, I shall subjoin the comment of one of his intimate friends,5 whose work, we are informed by Dr Willich, had received the sanction of Kant him¬ self. “ The aim of Kant’s Critique is no less than to lead Reason to the true knowledge of it¬ self ; to examine the titles upon which it founds the supposed possession of its metaphysical knowledge ; and by means of this examination, to mark the true limits, beyond which it cannot venture to speculate, without wandering into the empty region of pure fancy.” The same author adds, “ The whole Critique of Pure Reason is es¬ tablished upon this principle, that there is a free reason, independent of all experience and sensation.” montrer qu’ils ne sont pas plus propres a satisfaire la raison que le gout.

She adds, however, that they had no school, since none of them attempted to found any system; but they began the war against the doctrines of the Materialists—(Allemagne, Tome III. p. 98.) I am not acquainted with the metaphysical works of any of the three. Those of Hemsterhuis, who wrote wholly in French, were, I understand, first published in a collected form at Paris, in 1792. He was son of the celebrated Greek scholar and critic, Tiberius Hemsterhusius, Profes¬ sor of Latin Literature at Leyden","Kant, Kant, Willich, Kant, Kant, Paris, Kant, Paris","KG,DE,US,FR,GR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany,United States,France,Greece","Asia,Europe,North America,Europe,Europe"
"11 est a regretter que sa logique, intitule Organon, ne soil traduite ni en Latin, ni en Francais, ni je pense en aucune langue. Un extrait bien fait de cet ouvrage, duquel on e'carteroit ce qui repugne au gout national, exciteroit 1’attention des philosophes, et la porteroit sur une multitude d’obje'ts qu’ils se sont accoutumes a regardgr avec indifference.”—(Pre¬ vost, Tome II. pp. 267, 268.) In the article Lambert, inserted in the twenty-third volume of the Biographic Universelle (Paris 1819), the following ac¬ count is given of Lambert’s logic :—“ Wolf, d’apres quelques indications de Leibnitz, avoit retire de 1’oubli la syllogistique d’Aristote, science que les scholastiques avoient tellement avilie que ni Bacon ni Locke n’avoient ose lui accorder un regard d’inte'ret. II e'toit reserve d Lambert de la montrer sous le plus beau jour et dans la plus riche parure. C’est ce qu’il a fait dans son Novum Organon, ouvrage qui est un des principaux titres de gloire de son auteur.” From the writer of this article (M. Servois) we farther learn, that the Novum Organon of Lambert was translated into Latin from the German ori¬ ginal by a person of the name of Pfleiderer, and that this translation was in the hands of an English nobleman (the late Earl of Stanhope) as lately as 1782. I quote the words of M. Servois, in the hope that they may attract some attention to the manuscript, if it be still in existence. The publication of it would certainly be a most acceptable present to the learned world. “ D’apres le conseil de Le Sage de Geneve, 1’ouvrage fut traduit en Latin par Pfleiderer, aux frais d’un savant Italien; cette traduction passa, on ne sait comment, entre les mains de Milord Mahon, qui la possedoit encore en 1782; on ignore quel est son sort ulterieur.” 4 Kant was born at Koenigsberg, in Prussia, in 1724.

"In England, the word Idealist is most commonly restricted to such as (with Berkeley) reject the existence of a material world. Of late, its meaning has been sometimes extended (particularly since the publications of lleid) to all those who i-e- tain the theory of Descartes and Locke, concerning the immediate objects of our perceptions and thoughts, whether they admit or reject the consequences deduced from this theory by the Berkeleians. In the present state of the science, it would contribute much to the distinctness of our reasonings were it to be used in this last sense exclusively","Berkeley, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"There is another word to which Madame de Stael and other writers on the German philosophy annex an idea peculiar to themselves ; I mean the word experimental or empirical. This epithet is often used by them to distinguish what thev call the philosophy of Sensations, from that of Plato and of Leibnitz. It is accordingly generally, if not always, employed by them in an unfavourable sense. In this country, on the contrary, the experimental or inductive philosophy of the hu¬ man mind denotes those speculations concerning mind, which, rejecting all hypothetical theories, rest solely on phenomena for which we have the evidence of consciousness.

"From an article in the Edinburgh Review (Vol. XXVII. p. 191), we learn, that large unpublished manuscripts of Dr Cudworth are deposited in the British Museum. It is much to be regretted (as the author of the article observes), that they should have been so long withheld from the public. “ The press of the two Universities (he adds) would be properly employed in works, which a commercial publisher could not prudently undertake.” May we not indulge a hope, that this suggestion will, sooner or later, have its due effect ? in the preface of Mosheim to his Latin version of the Intellectual System, there is a catalogue of Cudworth’s unpublished remains, communicated to Mosheim by Dr Chandler, then Bishop of Durham. Among these are two distinct works on the Controversy concerning Liberty and Necessity, of each of which works Mosheim has given us the general contents","Durham, Liberty",US,8,United States,North America
"One of the chapters is entitled, “ Answer to the Objection against Liberty, [x'/'b'o avuinov.""

It is called by Dr Willich an excellent publication (Elements of the Critical Philosophy, p. 62.); and is pronounced by the author of the elaborate articles on that subject in the Encyclopaedia Londonemis to be a ster¬ ling work. “ Though at present very little known, I may venture,” says this writer, “ to predict, that, as time rolls on, and prejudices moulder away, this work, like the Elements of Euclid, will stand forth as a lasting monument of pure truth.” —See Note Z Z","Kant, Euclid","KG,US",8,"Kyrgyzstan,United States","Asia,North America"

"The Metaphysical Philosophy of Scotland, and, indeed, the literary taste in general, which so remarkably distinguished this country during the last century, may he dated from the lectures of Dr Francis Hutcheson, in the University of Glasgow. Strong indications of the same spe¬ culative spirit may be traced in earlier writers;2 hut it was from this period that Scotland, after a long slumber, began again to attract general notice in the republic of letters.3 The writings of Dr Hutcheson, however, are more closely connected with the history of Ethical than of Metaphysical Science; and I 1 Letter from the Reverend David Brown, Provost of the College of Fort William, about the Smscrit Edition of the Gospels (dated Calcutta, September 1806, and published in some of the Literary Journals of the day.) 4 See Note B B B","University, Glasgow","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"Some of the remarks on Berkeley’s argument against the existence of matter are acute and just, and, at the time when they were published, had the merit of novelty",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
1 One of the chief objects of Hutcheson’s writings was to oppose the licentious system of Mandeville; a system which was the natural offspring of some of Locke’s reasonings against the existence of innate practical principles,Mandeville,JM,8,Jamaica,North America
"As a moralist, Hutcheson was a warm admirer of the ancients, and seems to have been particularly smitten with that favourite doctrine of the Socratic school which identifies the good with the beautiful. Hence he was led to follow much too closely the example of Shaftesbury, in considering moral distinctions as founded more on sentiment than on reason, and to speak vaguely of virtue as a sort of noble enthusiasm; but he was led, at the same time, to connect with his ethical speculations some collateral inquiries concerning Beauty and Harmony, in which he pursued, with con¬ siderable success, the path recently struck out by Addison in his Essays on the Pleasures of the Imagination. These in¬ quiries of Hutcheson, together with his Thoughts on Laughter, although they may not be very highly prized for their depth, bear everywhere the marks of an enlarged and cultivated mind, and, whatever may have been their effects else¬ where, certainly contributed powerfully, in our Northern seats of learning, to introduce a taste for more liberal and elegant pursuits than could have been expected so soon to succeed to the intolerance, bigotry, and barbarism of the preceding century",Addison,US,8,United States,North America
"3 A gentleman, who lived in habits of great intimacy with Dr Held towards the close of his life, and on whose accuracy I can fully depend, remembers to have heard him say repeatedly, that “ Mr Hume, in his Essays, appeared to hwe forgot¬ ten his Metaphysics.” Nor will this supposition be thought improbable, if, in addition to the subtle and fugitive nature of the subjects canvassed in the Treatise of Human Nature, it be considered that long before the publication of his Essays, Mr Hume had abandoned all his metaphysical researches. In proof of this, I shall quote a passage from a letter of his to Sir Gilbert Elliot, which, though without a date, seems from its contents to have been written about 1750 or 1751. The pas¬ sage is interesting on another account, as it serves to show how much Mr Hume undervalued the utility of mathematical learning, and consequently how little he was aware of its importance, as an organ of physical discovery, and as the founda¬ tion of some of the most necessary arts of civilised life. “ I am sorry that our correspondence should lead us into these ab¬ stract speculations. I have thought, and read, and composed very little on such questions of late. Morals, politics, and literature, have employed all my time ; but still the other topics I must think more curious, important, entertaining, and useful, than any geometry that is deeper than Euclid.” I have said that it is in Mr Hume’s earliest work that his metaphysical talents appear, in my opinion, to the greatest advantage. From the following advertisement, however, prefixed, in the latest editions of his works, to the second volume of his Essays and Treatises, Mr Hume himself would appear to have thought differently. “Most of the principles and rea¬ sonings contained in this volume were published in a work in three volumes, called A Treatise of Human Nature ; a work which the author had projected before he left College, and which he wrote and published not long after. But not finding it successful, he was sensible of his error in going to the press too early, and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces, where some negligencies in his former reasoning, and some in the expression, are, he hopes, corrected. Yet several wri¬ ters, who have honoured the author’s philosophy with answers, have taken care to direct all their batteries against that ju¬ venile work, which the author never acknowledged, and have affected to triumph in any advantage which they imagined they had obtained over it; a practice very contrary to all rules of candour and fair dealing, and a strong instance of those polemical artifices which a bigoted zeal thinks itself authorised to employ. Henceforth, the author desires, that the follow¬ ing pieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical sentiments and principles.” After this declaration, it certainly would be highly uncandid to impute to Mr Hume any philosophical sentiments or principles not to be found in his Philosophical Essays, as well as in his Treatise. But where is the unfairness of replying to any plausible arguments in the latter work, even although Mr Hume may have omitted them in his subsequent publications ; more especially where these arguments supply any useful lights for illustrating his more popular compositions ? The Treatise of Human Nature will certainly be remembered as long as any of Mr Hume’s philosophical writings ; nor is any person qualified either to approve or to reject his doctrines, who has not studied them in the systematical form in which they were originally cast. That Mr Hume’s remonstrance may be just with respect to some of his adversaries, I believe to be true ; but it is surely expressed in a tone more querulous and peevish than is justified by the occasion","Euclid, Most","US,CZ",8,"United States,Czechia","North America,Europe"
"The publication of Mr Hume’s Treatise was attended with another important effect in Scot¬ land. He had cultivated the art of writing with much greater success than any of his predeces¬ sors, and had formed his taste on the best models of English composition. The influence of his example appears to have been great and gene¬ ral ; and was in no instance more remarkable than in the style of his principal antagonists, all of whom, in studying his system, have caught, in no inconsiderable degree,- the purity, polish, and precision of his diction. Nobody, I believe, will deny, that Locke himself, considered as an English writer, is far surpassed, not only by Hume, but by Reid, Campbell, Gerard, and Beattie; and of this fact it will not be easy to find a more satisfactory explanation, than in the critical eye with which they were led to canvass a work, equally distinguished by the depth of its reasonings, and by the attractive form in which they are exhibited",Campbell,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"
"209 Berkeley. Like Descartes, he began with doubt¬ ing of every thing, but he was too quick-sighted to be satisfied, like Descartes, with the solutions given by that philosopher of his doubts. On the contrary, he exposes the futility not only of the solutions proposed by Descartes himself, but of those suggested by Locke and others among his successors ; ending at last where Descartes beg^n, in considering no one proposition as more certain, or even as more probable than another",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"Nay, it had been shown by Berkeley and others, that if the principles be admitted on which Des¬ cartes, in common with all philosophers, from Aristotle downwards, proceeded, the existence of the material world is impossible. A few bold thinkers, distinguished by the name of Egoists, had gone still farther than this, and had pushed their scepticism to such a length, as to doubt of everything but their own existence. Accord¬ ing to these) the proposition, eogito, ergo sum, is the only truth which can be regarded as abso¬ lutely certain. It was reserved for Mr Hume to call in question even this proposition, and to admit only the existence of impressions and ideas",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"It is neither a scheme of Materialism, nor a scheme of Spiritualism; for his reasonings strike equally at the root of both these theories. His aim is to establish a universal scepticism, and to produce in the reader a complete distrust in his own faculties. For this purpose he avails himself of the data assumed by the most op¬ posite sects, shifting his ground skilfully from one position to another, as best suits the scope of his present argument. With the single ex¬ ception of Bayle, he has carried this sceptical mode of reasoning farther than any other mo¬ dern philosopher. Cicero, who himself belong¬ ed nominally to the same school, seems to have thought, that the controversial habits imposed on the Academical sect by their profession of universal doubt, required a greater versatility of talent and fertility of invention, than were ne¬ cessary for defending any particular system of tenets;1 and it is not improbable, that Mr Hume, in the pride of youthful genius, was misled by this specious but very fallacious idea. On the other hand, Bayle has the candour to acknow¬ ledge, that nothing is so easy as to dispute after the manner of the sceptics;2 3 * and to this propo¬ sition every man of reflection will find himself more and more disposed to assent, as he ad¬ vances in life. It is experience alone that can convince us, how much more difficult it is to make any real progress in the search after truth, than to acquire a talent for plausible dis¬ putation.5 That this spirit of sceptical argument has been 1 “ Nam si singulas disciplinas percipere magnum est, quanto majus omnes ? quod facere iis necesse est, quibus proposi- tum est, veri reperiendi causa, et contra omnes philosophos et pro omnibus dicere—Cujus rei tantse tamque dimcilis xacul- tatem consecutum esse me non profiteer: Secutum esse prae me fero.”—(Cicero Be Nat. Dear. 1. i. v.) 2 See the passage quoted from Bayle, in page 86 of this Dissertation. _ 3 In the very interesting account, given by Dr Holland, of Velara, a modern Greek physician, whom he met with at-La- rissa in Thessaly, a few slight particulars are mentioned, which let us completely into the character of that ingenious per¬ son. “ It appeared,” says Dr Holland, “ that Velara had thought much on the various topics of Metaphysics and Morals, and his conversation on these topics bore the same tone of satirical scepticism which was apparent as the general feature o his opinions. We spoke of the questions of Materialism and Necessity, on both of which he declared an affirmative opi¬ nion.”—(Holland’s Travels in the Ionian Isles, See. p. 275.) “ I passed this evening with Velara at his own house, and sat with him till a late hour. During part of the time our conversation turned upon metaphysical topics, and chiefly on the old Pyrrhonic doctrine of the non-existence of Matter. Velara, as usual, took the sceptical side of the argument, in w ^ic he showed much ingenuity and great knowledge of the more eminent controversialists on this and other collateral subjec s. - CIbid. p. 370.) We see here a lively picture of a character daily to be met with in more polished and learned societies, dis¬ puting not for truth but for victory; in the first conversation professing himself a Materialist; and in the secon enyin0 the existence of Matter ; on both occasions, taking up that ground where he was most likely to provoke opposi ion","Cicero, Holland","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

The notion of its permanency, although it be conventional and ar¬ bitrary, and liable, in reality, to many causes of variation, yet had gained so firm a hold on the minds of men, as to re¬ semble, in its effects on their conduct, that instinctive conviction of the permanency of the laws of nature which is the foimdation of all our reasoning.""—(A Letter to the Right Hon.

"Claude and the Protestants answered him, not by solving his difficulties (which seems impos¬ sible), but by retorting them (which is very easy.) They showed, that to reach the way of authority which the Catholics insist on, as long a train of acute reasoning, and as great erudi¬ tion was requisite, as would be sufficient for a Protestant. We must first piwe all the truths of natural religion, the foundation of morals, the divine authority of the Scripture, the de¬ ference which it commands to the church, the tradition of the church, &c. &c. The compari¬ son of these controversial writings begat an idea in some, that it was neither by reasoning nor authority we learn our religion, but by senti¬ ment ; and this was certainly a vei*y convenient way, and what a philosopher would be very well pleased to comply with, if he could dis¬ tinguish sentiment from education. But, to all appearance, the sentiment of Stockholm, Geneva, Rome, ancient and modern Athens, and Memphis, have not the same characters; and no thinking man can implicitly assent to any of them, but from the general principle, that, as the truth on these subjects is beyond human capacity, and that, as for one’s own ease, he must adopt some tenets, there is more satisfac¬ tion and com enience in holding to the cate¬ chism we have been first taught. Now, this I have nothing to say against. I would only observe, that such a conduct is founded on the most universal and determined scepticism. For more curiosity and research give a direct oppo¬ site turn from the same principles.” On this careless effusion of Mr Hume’s pen, it would be unpardonable to offer any critical strictures. It cannot, however, be considered as improper to hint, that there is a wide and essential difference between those articles of faith which formed the subjects of dispute be¬ tween Nicole and Claude, and those laws of be- lief, of which it is the great object of the Trea¬ tise of Human Nature to undermine the autho¬ rity.

"217 you with any formal compliments or thanks, which would be but an ill return for the kind¬ ness you have done me in writing in my behalf, to one you are so little acquainted with as Dr Butler; and, I am afraid, stretching the truth in favour of a friend. I have called on the doc¬ tor, with a design of delivering your letter, but find he is at present in the country. I am a little anxious to have the doctor’s opinion. My own I dare not trust to; both because it concerns myself, and because it is so variable, that I know not how to fix it. Sometimes it elevates me above the clouds ; at other times it depresses me with doubts and fears; so that, whatever be my success, I cannot be entirely disappointed.” Whether Mr Hume ever enjoyed the satisfac¬ tion of a personal interview with Dr Butler, I have not heard. From a letter of his to Mr Home, dated London, 1739, we learn that if any intercourse took place between them, it must have been after the publication of the Treatise of Human Nature. “ I have sent the Bishop of Bristol a copy; but could not wait upon him with your letter after he had arrived at that dignity. At least, I thought it would be to no purpose after I began the printing.”1 In a subsequent letter to the same correspondent, written in 1742, he expresses his satisfaction at the favourable opinion which he understood Dr Butler had formed of his volume of Essays, then recently published, and augurs well from this circumstance of the success of his book. “ I am told that Dr Butler has everywhere recommend¬ ed them, so that I hope they will have some success.”2 3 * These particulars, trifling as they may ap¬ pear to some, seemed to me, for more reasons than one, not unworthy of notice in this sketch","London, Bristol","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Dr Reid’s Inquiry into the Human Mind (pub¬ lished in 1764) was the first direct attack which appeared in Scotland upon the sceptical conclu¬ sions of Mr Hume’s philosophy. For my own opinion of this work I must refer to one of my former publications.2 It is enough to remark here, that its great object is to refute the Ideal Theory which was then in complete possession of the schools, and upon which Dr Reid con¬ ceived that the whole of Mr Hume’s philosophy, as well as the whole of Berkeley’s reasonings against the existence of matter, was founded",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"According to this theory we are taught, that “ nothing is perceived but what is in the mind which perceives it; that we do not really per¬ ceive things that are external, but only cer¬ tain images and pictures of them imprinted upon the mind, which are called impressions and ideas.”—cc This doctrine (says Dr Reid on ano¬ ther occasion) I once believed so firmly, as to embrace the whole of Berkeley’s system along with it; till finding other consequences to fol¬ low from it, which gave me more uneasiness than the want of a material world, it came into my mind, more than forty years ago, to put the question, What evidence have I for this doc¬ trine, that all the objects of my knowledge are ideas in my own mind ? From that time to the present, I have been candidly and impartial¬ ly, as I think, seeking for the evidence of this principle; but can find none, excepting the authority of philosophers.” On the refutation of the ideal theory, con¬ tained in this and his other works, Dr Reid himself was disposed to rest his chief merit as an author. “ The merit (says he in a letter to Dr James Gregory) of what you are pleased to call my Philosophy, lies, I think, chiefly in having called in question the common theory of ideas or images of things in the mind being the only objects of thought; a theory founded on natural prejudices, and so universally received as to be interwoven with the structure of lan¬ guage. Yet were I to give you a detail of what led me to call in question this theory, after I had long held it as self-evident and unquestion¬ able, you would think, as I do, that there was much of chance in the matter. The discovery was the birth of time, not of genius; and Berke- 1 I must not, however, be understood as giving unqualified praise to this Essay. It is by no means free from the old scholastic jargon, and contains some reasoning which, I may confidently assert, the author would not have employed, had it been written fifty years later. Whoever takes the trouble to read the paragraph beginning with these words, “ Thirdly, Every person is conscious,” &c. will immediately perceive the truth of this remark. I mention it as a proof of the change to the better, which has taken place since Butler’s time, in the mode of thinking and writing on Metaphysical questions",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"“ The author of an Inquiry into the Mind, and of subsequent Essays on the Intellectual and Active Powers of Man, has great merit in the effect to which he has pursued this history. But, considering the point at which the science stood when he began his inquiries, he has, perhaps, no less merit in having removed the mist of hypothesis and metaphor, with which the subject was enveloped; and, in having taught us to state the facts of which we are conscious, not in figurative language, but in the terms which are proper to the subject. In this it will be our advantage to follow him ; the more that, in former theories, so much attention had been paid to the introduction of ideas or images as the elements of knowledge, that the be¬ lief of any external existence or prototype has been left to be inferred from the mere idea or image; and this inference, indeed, is so little founded, that many who have come to examine its evidence have thought themselves warranted to deny it altogether. And hence the scepticism of ingenious men, who, not seeing a proper access to knowledge through the me¬ dium of ideas, without considering whether the road they had been directed to take was the true or a false one, denied the possibility of arriving at the end.”—(Principles of Moral and Political Science, by Dr Adam Ferguson, Vol. I. pp. 7b, 76.) The work from which this passage is taken contains various important observations connected with the Philosophy of the Human Mind; but as the taste of the author led him much more strongly to moral and political speculations, than to re¬ searches concerning the intellectual powers of man, I have thought it right to reserve any remarks which I have to offer on his philosophical merits for the last part of this Discourse","Man, Ferguson","CI,US",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,United States","Africa,North America"
"2 I allude here more particularly to Dr Priestley, who, in a work published in 177b alleged, that when philosophers called ideas the images of external things, they are only to be understood as speaking figuratively; and that Dr Reid has gravely argued against this metaphorical language, as if it were meant to convey a theory of perception. The same remark has been repeated over and over since Priestley’s time, by various writers. I have nothing to add in reply to it to what I long ago stated in my Philosophical Essays (see Note H. at the end of that work), but the following short quotation from Mr Hume:— “ It seems evident, that, when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other. * * * * But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest phi¬ losophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inlets through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table which we see seems to diminish as we remove farther from it; but the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration. It was, therefore, nothing but its image which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason.”—(Essay on the Academical Philosophy.) Is not this analogical theory of perception the principle on which the whole of Berkeley’s reasonings against the existence of the material world, and of Hume’s scepticism on the same subject, are founded ? The same analogy still continues to be sanctioned by some English philosophers of no small note. Long after the publi¬ cation of Dr Reid’s Inquiry, Mr Horne Tooke quoted with approbation the following words of J. C. Scaliger : “ Sicut in speculo ea quse videntur non sunt, sed eorum species ; ita quae intelligimus, ea sunt re ipsa extra nos, eorumque species in nobis. Est enim quasi rerum speculum intellectus noster; cui, nisi per sensum represententur res, nihil scit ipse.”—(J. C. Scaliqer, de Causis, L. I., cap. Ixvi.) Dfrmwnw of Parley, Vol. I. p. 35, 2d.

"Nor have these elegant applications of meta¬ physical pursuits been altogether overlooked by Mr Hume’s antagonists. The active and ad¬ venturous spirit of Lord Kames, here, as in many other instances, led the way to his coun¬ trymen ; and, due allowances being made for the novelty and magnitude of his undertaking, with a success far greater than could have been reasonably anticipated. The Elements of Criti¬ cism, considered as the first systematical attempt to investigate the metaphysical principles of the 1 According to Dr Priestley, the labours of these commentators on Locke have done more harm than good. “ I think Mr Locke has been hasty in concluding that there is some other source of our ideas besides the external senses ; but the rest of his system appears to me and others to be the corner stone of all just and rational knowledge of ourselves.” “ This solid foundation, however, has lately been attempted to be overturned by a set of pretended philosophers,^ of whom the most conspicuous and assuming is Dr Iteid, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow.’ — (Exam, of Reid, Beattie, and Oswald, p. 5.)—As to Mr Hume, Dr Priestley says, “ In my opinion, he has been very ably answered, again and again, upon more solid principles than those of this new common sense ; and I beg leave to refer to the two first volumes of my Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion.""—(Examination of Reid, 8[C.

Campbell and Gerard, with a sounder philosophy, and Beattie, with a much more lively relish for the Sublime and the Beau¬ tiful, followed afterwards in the same path; and have all contributed to create and to diffuse over this island a taste for a higher and more en¬ lightened species of criticism than was known to our forefathers. Among the many advan¬ tageous results with which this study has been already attended, the most important, undoubt¬ edly, is the new and pleasing avenue which it has opened to an analysis of the laws which re¬ gulate the intellectual phenomena; and the in¬ terest which it has thus lent, in the estimation of men of the world, to inquiries which, not many years before, were seldom heard of, but within the walls of an university",Campbell,US,8,United States,North America
"Campbell has touched upon it with his usual acuteness, hut he has attempted nothing more than an illustration of a very few general prin¬ ciples. Nor has he turned his attention to the various illusions of the imagination, and of the passions, by which the judgment is liable to he warped in the estimates it forms of moral evi¬ dence in the common affairs of life. This is a most important inquiry, considering how often the lives and fortunes of men are subjected to the decisions of illiterate persons concerning cir¬ cumstantial proofs; and how much the success or failure of every individual in the conduct of his private concerns turns on the sagacity or rashness with which he anticipates future con¬ tingencies. Since the time when Campbell wrote, an attempt has been made by Condorcet2 and some other French writers, to apply a mathema¬ tical calculus to moral and political truths; but though much metaphysical ingenuity, as well as mathematical skill, have been displayed in carry¬ ing it into execution, it has not yet led to any useful practical results. Perhaps it may even be questioned, whether, in investigating truths of this sort, the intellectual powers can derive much aid from the employment of such an organ","Campbell, Campbell","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

"early habits of abstract meditation. To this fact Burke probably alluded, when he remarked, that (i by turning the soul inward on itself, its forces are concentered, and are fitted for stronger and bolder flights of science; and that in such pur¬ suits, whether we take, or whether we lose the game, the chase is certainly of service.” The names of Locke, of Berkeley, of Hume, of Quesnai, of Turgot, of Morellet, and above all, of Adam Smith, will at once illustrate the truth of these observations, and show, that, in com¬ bining together, in this Dissertation, the sciences of Metaphysics, of Ethics, and of Politics, I have not adopted an arrangement altogether capri¬ cious. 1 In farther justification of this arrangement, I might appeal to the popular prejudices so in¬ dustriously fostered by many, against these three branches of knowledge, as ramifications from one common and most pernicious root","Burke, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America

How much these have contributed to promote the progress of mathematical knowledge in France may be judged of from an assertion of Condorcet, that two years spent under an able teacher now carry the student beyond the conclusions which limited the researches of Leibnitz and of Newton. The Es¬ says lately published on this subject by M. Lacroix (Essais sur VEnseignement en General, et sur celui des Mathematiques en particulier.

The spirit of philosophy has infused itself into the structure of our sentences.” He remarks farther, in favour of the present style of English composition, “ that it at once satisfies the understanding and the ear.” The union of these two excellencies certainly constitutes the perfection of writing. Johnson boasts, and with truth, in the concluding paper of the Rambler, that he had “ added something to our language in the elegance of its construction, and something in the harmony of its cadence;” but what a sacrifice did he make to these objects, of conciseness, of simpli¬ city, and of (what he has himself called) Genuine Anglicism. To accomplish the same ends, without any sacrifice of these higher merits, has been one of the chief aims of the most eminent among his successors",Johnson,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"
"As an instrument of thought and a medium of scientific communication, the English language appears to me, in its pre¬ sent state, to be far superior to the French. Diderot, indeed (a very high authority), has, with much confidence, asserted the contrary; and it is but fair to let him speak for himself: “ J’ajouterois volontiers que la marche didactique et reglee a laquelle notre langue est assujettie la rend plus propre aux sciences; et que par les tours et les inversions que le Grec, le Latin, ITtalien, 1’Anglois, se permettent, ces langues sont plus avantageuses pour les lettres: Que nous pouvons mieux qu’ aucun autre peuple faire parler I’esprit; et que le bon sens choisiroit la langue Francoise; mais que ITmagination et les passions donneroient la preference aux langues anciennes et a celles de nos voisins: Qu’il faut parler Francois dans la societd et dans les dcoles de Philosophic; et Grec, Latin, Anglois, dans les chaires et sur le Theatre: Que notre langue seroit celle de la verite, si jamais elle revient sur la terre; et que la Grecque, la Latine, et les autres seroient les langues de la fable et du mensonge. Le Francois est fait pour instruire, edairer, et convaincre; le Grec, le Latin, ITtalien, 1’Ang¬ lois, pour persuader, emouvoir, et tromper; parlez Grec, Latin, Italien au peuple, mais parlez Francois au sage.”— (CEuvres de Diderot, Tome II. pp. 70, 71- Amsterdam, 1772.) These peculiar excellencies of the French language are ascribed, in part, by Diderot, to the study of the Aristotelian Phi¬ losophy (Ibid. p. 7.) I do not well see what advantage France should, in this respect, have enjoyed over England ; and since that philosophy fell into disrepute, it will scarcely be alleged that the habits of thinking cultivated by Locke’s dis¬ ciples have been less favourable to a logical rigour of expression than those of any contemporary sect of French metaphy¬ sicians",Amsterdam,"FR,US,UK",8,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"de Bonald against the former is, in fact, precisely the same with that ascribed by Xenophon to So¬ crates against those studies which have immor¬ talised the names of Boyle and Newton; and which, in our own times, have revealed to us all the wonders of the modern chemistry. What¬ ever contradictions, therefore, may yet exist in our metaphysical doctrines (and of these con¬ tradictions many more than is commonly sus¬ pected will be found to be merely verbal), why should we despair of the success of future ages in tracing the laws of the intellectual world, which, though less obvious than those of the material world, are not less the natural and le¬ gitimate objects of human curiosity? Nor is it at all wonderful that the beneficial effects of metaphysical habits of thinking should have been first perceived in political economy, and some other sciences to which, on a super¬ ficial view, they may seem to have a very remote relation; and that the rise of the sap in the tree of knowledge should be indicated by the germs at the extremities of the branches, before any 1 Recherches Philosophiques, &c. p. 2.

"The prevailing idea among Machiavel’s con¬ temporaries and immediate successors certainly was, that the design of the Prince was hostile to the rights of mankind; and that the author was either entirely unprincipled, or adapted his pro¬ fessed opinions to the varying circumstances of his own eventful life. The following are the words of Bodinus, born in 1530, the very year when Machiavel died; an author whose judg¬ ment will have no small weight with those who are acquainted with his political writings: 44 Machiavel s’est bien fort mesconte, de dire que 1’estat populaire est le meilleur:1 et neantmoins ayant oublie sa premiere opinion, il a tenu en un autre lieu,2 que pour restituer ITtalie en sa liberte, il faut qu’il n’y ait qu’un Prince; et de fait, il s’est efforce de former un estat le plus tyrannique du monde; et en autre lieu* il con- fesse, que 1’estat de Venice est le plus beau de tous, lequel est une pure Aristocratic, s’il en fut onques: tellement qu’il ne scait a quoi se tenir.” —(De la mpublique, Liv. vi. chap. iv. Paris, 1576). In the Latin version of the above pas¬ sage, the author applies to Machiavel the phrase, Homo levissimus ac nequissimus","Venice, Paris",US,8,United States,North America
"It has been objected to me, that in the fore¬ going observations on the design of the Prince, I have taken no notice of the author’s vindication of himself and his writings, in his letter to Zenobius Buondelmontius, annexed to the old English translation of Machiavel, printed at London in 1675 and 1680. In the preface to this translation, we are told, that the letter in question “ had never before been published in any language, but lurked for above eighty years in the private cabinets of his own kindred, or the descendants of his admirers in Florence, till, in the Pontificate of Urban VIII., it was procured by the Jesuits and other busy bodies, and brought to Rome with an intention to divert that wise Pope from his design of making one of Nicholas Machiavel’s name and family cardinal, as (not¬ withstanding all their opposition) he did, not long after. When it was gotten into that city, it wanted not those who had the judgment and curiosity to copy it, and so at length came to en¬ joy that privilege which all rare pieces (even the sharpest libels and pasquins) challenge at that court, which is to be sold to strangers, one of which, being a gentleman of this country, brought it over with him at his return from thence in 1645, and having translated it into English, did communicate it to divers of his friends; and by means of some of them, it hath been my good fortune to be capable of making thee a present of it; and let it serve as an apology for our author and his writings, if thou th'nkest he need any.” As the translation of Machiavel, from which Notes this advertisement is copied, is still in the hands uiu *""adi(r.s of many readers in this country, it may not be improper to mention here, that the letter in question is altogether of English fabrication; and (as far as I can learn) is quite unknown on the Continent. It is reprinted at the end of the second volume of Farneworth’s Translation of Machiavel’s works, 1762, with the following statement prefixed to it.1 “ The following letter having been printed in all the editions of the old translation, it is here given to the reader, though it certainly was not written by Machiavel. It bears date in 1537, and his death is placed by all the best historians in 1530. There are, besides, in it many internal marks, which to the judicious will clearly prove it to be the work of some other writer, vainly endeavouring at the style and manner of our excellent author. The letter is indeed a spirited and judicious defence of Machiavel and his writings; but it is written in a style too inflated, and is utterly void of that elegance and precision which so much distinguish the works of the Florentine secretary.” To the author of this last translation we are farther indebted for a very curious letter of Dr Warburton’s, which renders it probable that the forgery was contrived and carried into execution by the Marquis of Wharton.

"“ There is at the end of the English transla¬ tion of Machiavel’s works, printed in folio, 1680, a translation of a pretended letter of Machiavel to Zenobius Buondelmontius, in vindication of himself and his writings. I believe it has been generally understood to be a feigned thing, and has by some been given to Nevil, he who wrote, if I do not mistake, the Plato lledivims. But many years ago, a number of the famous Marquis of Wharton’s papers (the father of the Duke) were put into my hands. Amongst these was the press copy (as appearedby the printer’s marks, where any page of the printed letter began and ended) of this remarkable letter in the Marquis’s hand-writing, as I took it to be, compared with 1 In a book published 1816, this letter is referred to without any expression of doubt as to its authenticity.

This parti- cular letter may be read at the end of the last volume of Pignotti’s Storia della Toscana; a book published here, but which was in all the London shops before I came away. It is to be found also with several others, which are entertaining and curious, in a new collection published at Florence in 1814, of Machiavel’s public dispatches and familiar letters. By the way, I must likewise tell Mr Stewart that my late reading has suggested a slight criticism upon one expression of his with regard to Ma¬ chiavel’s Prince^ where he calls it one of the “ latest of his publications.” The fact is, that the three great works were none of them pub¬ lished in his lifetime, nor for four years after his death. They appear to have been all writ¬ ten at the same period of his life, during the eight or ten years of leisure that were forced upon him; and I believe it may he made out from the works themselves, that the Prince was composed and finished first of the three, then the Discourses, and last of all the History. This and the first having been written for the Medicis family, the MSS. were in their hands, and they published them; the Discourses were printed by the care of some of his personal friends. If Mr Stewart wishes to have the proof of all this in detail, I can draw it out without any trouble.” The foregoing passage will he read by many with no common interest, when it is known that it formed part of a letter from the late Francis Horner, written a very few weeks be¬ fore his death. Independently of the satisfac¬ tion I feel in preserving a memorial of his kind attention to his friends, at a period when he was himself an object of such anxious solicitude to his country, I was eager to record the opi¬ nion of so perfect and accomplished a judge on a question which, for more than two centuries, has divided the learned world; and which, his profound admiration of Machiavel’s genius, com¬ bined with the most unqualified detestation of Machiavel’s principles, had led him to study with peculiar care.

Of the extent and variety of his learning, the depth and accuracy of his scientific attainments, the classical (perhaps somewhat severe) purity of his taste, and the truly philosophical cast of his whole mind, none had better opportunities than myself to form a judgment, in the course of a friendship which commenced before he left the University, and which grew till the moment of his death. But on these rare endowments of his understanding, or the still rarer combination of virtues which shed over all his mental gifts a characteristi- cal grace and a moral harmony, this is not the proper place to enlarge.

"Even in Bacon’s professional line, it is now admitted, by the best judges, that he was great¬ ly underrated by his contemporaries. “ The Queen did acknowledge,” says the Earl of Es¬ sex, in a letter to Bacon himself, “ you had a great wit, and an excellent gift of speech, and much other good learning. But in law, she ra¬ ther thought you could make shew, to the utmost of your knowledge, than that you were deep.” “ If it be asked,” says Dr Hurd, “ how the Queen came to form this conclusion, the answer is plain. It was from Mr Bacon’s having a great wit, an excellent gift of speech, and much other good learning.”—(Hurd’s Dialogues.) The following testimony to Bacon’s legal knowledge (pointed out to me by a learned friend) is of somewhat more weight than Queen Elizabeth’s judgment against it: <£ What might we not have expected,” says Mr Hargrave, af¬ ter a high encomium on the powers displayed by Bacon in his ‘ Reading on the Statute of Uses ;’ “ what might we not have expected from the hands of such a master, if his vast mind had not so embraced within its compass the whole field of science, as very much to detach him from professional studies !?> It was probably owing in part to his court- disgrace, that so little notice was taken of Ba- Notes con, for some time after his death, by those Eng- iiius^ad.ioni lish writers who availed themselves, without any scruple, of the lights struck out in his works. A very remarkable example of this oc¬ curs in a curious, though now almost forgotten hook (published in 1627), entitled, An Apology or Declaration of the Power and Providence of God in the Government of the World, by George Hakewill, D. D. Archdeacon of Surrey. It is plainly the production of an uncommonly liberal and enlightened mind; well stored with various and choice learning, collected both from ancient and modern authors. Its general aim may he guessed at from the text of Scripture prefixed to it as a motto, “ Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days are better than these, for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this and from the words of Ovid, so happily applied by Hakewill to the “ common error touching the golden age,” Prisca juvent alios, ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor","Elizabeth, Reading, Providence, George, Surrey","US,ZA,CA",8,"United States,South Africa,Canada","North America,Africa,North America"
"“ When I returned,” says he, C{ from Spain by Paris, Mr Hobbes frequently came to me, and the word easy, I presume Sprat here means the native and spontaneous growth of Bacon’s own fancy, in opposi¬ tion to the traditionary similes borrowed by common-place writers from their predecessors",Paris,"ES,US",8,"Spain,United States","Europe,North America"
"I have alluded, in the text, to the difference between the popular and the scholastic notion of substance. According to the latter, the word substance corresponds to the Greek word ouova, as employed by Aristotle to denote the first of the predicaments; in which technical sense it is said, in the language of the schools, to signify that which supports attributes, or which is sub¬ ject to accidents. At a period when every person liberally educated was accustomed to this bar¬ barous jargon, it might not appear altogether absurd to apply the term substance to the human soul, or even to the Deity. But, in the present times, a writer who so employs it may be as¬ sured, that, to a great majority of his readers, it will be no less puzzling than it was to Crambe, in Martinus Scriblerus, when he first heard it thus defined by his master Cornelius.1 How extraordinary does the following sentence now sound even to a philosophical ear ? and yet it is copied from a work published little more than seventy years ago, by the learned and judicious Gravesande: Substantiae sunt aut cogitantes, aut non cogitantes; cogitantes duas novimus, 1 “ When he was told, a substance was that which was subject to accidents, then soldiers, quoth Cramhe, are the most sub¬ stantial people in the world.” Let me add, that, in the list of philosophical reformers, the authors of Martinus Scriblerus ought not to be overlooked. Their happy ridicule of the scholastic Logic and Metaphysics is universally known ; but few are aware of the acuteness and sagacity displayed in their allusions to some of the most vulnerable passages in Locke’s Essav.

"I speak of those which are perceived by sight.”1 Among the multitude of arguments advanced by Berkeley, in support of his favourite theory, I do not recollect any that strikes me more with the appearance of a wilful sophism than the foregoing. It is difficult to conceive how so very acute a reasoner should not have perceived that his premises, in this instance, lead to a con¬ clusion directly opposite to what he has drawn from them. Supposing all mankind to have an irresistible conviction of the outness and distance of extension and figure, it is very easy to explain, from the association of ideas, and from our early habits of inattention to the phenomena of con¬ sciousness, how the sensations of colour should appear to the imagination to be transported 1 Essay toward a New Theory of Vision, p. 255",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America

But if, according to Berkeley’s Illustrations, doctrines, the constitution of human nature —leads men to believe that extension and figure, and every other quality of the material universe, exists only within themselves, whence the ideas of external and of internal; of remote or of near ? When Berkeley says, “ I appeal to any man’s experience, whether the visible extension of any object doth not appear as near to him as the colour of that objecthow much more reason¬ able would it have been to have stated the in¬ disputable fact, that the colour of the object ap¬ pears as remote as its extension and figure ?

"It is observed by Dr Reid, that “ the system which is now generally*received with regard to the mind and its operations, derives not only its spirit from Descartes, but its fundamental prin¬ ciples; and that, after all the improvements made by Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, it may still be called the Cartesian sys¬ tem.”—Conclusion of the Inquiry into the Human Mind",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"It was plainly with the view of escaping from the dilemma proposed by Gassendi to Descartes, that Newton and Clarke were led to adopt a mode of speaking concerning perception, ap¬ proaching very nearly to the language of Des¬ cartes. “ Is not,” says Newton, “ the senso- rium of animals the place where the sentient substance is present; and to which the sensible species of things are brought, through the nerves and brain, that there they may be perceived by the mind present in that place ?” And still more confidently Dr Clarke: “ Without being pre¬ sent to the images of the things perceived, the soul could not possibly perceive them. A liv¬ ing substance can only there perceive where it is present. Nothing can any more act or be acted upon where it is not present, than it can when it is not.” The distinction between pri¬ mary and secondary qualities was afterwards re¬ jected by Berkeley, in the course of his argu¬ ment against the existence of matter; but he continued to retain the language of Descartes concerning ideas, and to consider them as the immediate, or rather as the only objects of our thoughts, wherever the external senses are con¬ cerned. Mr Hume’s notions and expressions on the subject are very nearly the same","Newton, Newton, Berkeley",US,8,United States,North America
"I thought it necessary to enter into these details, in order to show with what limitations the remark quoted from Dr Reid in the be¬ ginning of this note ought to be received. It is certainly true, that the Cartesian system may be said to form the groundwork of Locke’s Theory of Perception, as well as of the scepti¬ cal conclusions deduced from it by Berkeley and Hume; but it is not the less true, that it forms also the groundwork of all that has since been done towards the substitution, in place of his scepticism, of a more solid fabric of meta¬ physical science",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America

"It deserves to be remarked, as a circumstance which throws considerable light on the literary history of Scotland during the latter half of the eighteenth century, that, from time immemorial, a continued intercourse had been kept up be¬ tween Scotland and the Continent. To all who were destined for the profession of law, an edu¬ cation either at a Dutch or French university was considered as almost essential.

"The constant influx of information and of libera¬ lity from abroad, which was thus kept up in Scotland in consequence of the ancient habits and manners of the people, may help to account for the sudden burst of genius, which to a foreigner must seem to have sprung up in this country by a sort of enchantment, soon after the Rebellion of 1745. The great step then made was in the art of English composition. In the mathematical sciences, where the graces of writ¬ ing have no place, Scotland, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, was never, from the time of Neper, left behind by any country in Europe; nor ought it to be forgotten, that the philosophy of Newton was publicly taught by David Gregory at Edinburgh, and by his brother James Gregory at St Andrew’s, before it was able to supplant the vortices of Descartes in that very university of which Newton was a member.1 The case was similar in every other liberal pur¬ suit, where an ignorance of the delicacies of the English tongue was not an insuperable bar to distinction. Even in the study of eloquence, as far as it was attainable in their own vernacular idiom, some of the Scottish pleaders, about the era when the two kingdoms were united, seem ambitiously, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to have formed themselves upon models, which, in modern times, it has been commonly suppos¬ ed to be more safe to admire than to imitate.2 Of the progress made in this part of the island 1 For this we have the authority of Whiston, the immediate successor of Sir Isaac Newton in the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge; and of Dr Reid, who was a nephew of the two Gregorys. “ Mr Gregory had already caused several of his scholars to keep Acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian Philosophy ; while we at Cambridge, poor wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesians.”—(Whiston’s Memoirs of his own Life.) “ I have by me,”says Dr Reid, “a Thesis printed at Edinburgh, 1690, by James Gregory, who was at that time Pro¬ fessor of Philosophy at St Andrew’s, containing twenty-five positions; the first three relating to logic, and the abuse of it in the Aristotelian and Cartesian philosophy.

It seems to have never been sufficiently known to his adversaries, either in France or in England, that, after his philosophy had become fashion¬ able in Holland, a number of Dutch divines, whose opinions differed very widely from his, found it convenient to shelter their own errors under his established name; and that some of them went so far as to avail themselves of his authority in propagating tenets directly oppo¬ site to his declared sentiments. Hence a dis¬ tinction of the Cartesians into the genuine and the josewcfo-Cartesians; and hence an inconsis¬ tency in their representations of the metaphysi¬ cal ideas of their master, which can only be cleared up by a reference (seldom thought of) to his own very concise and perspicuous text",Holland,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"In the Acta Eruditorum for the year 1684, Leibnitz observes, that “ in the case of things which we have never thought of, the innate ideas in our minds may be compared to the figure of Hercules in a block of marble.” This seems to me to prove, that the difference between him and Locke was rather in appearance than in reality; and that, although he called those ideas innate which Locke was at pains to trace to sen¬ sation or to reflection, he would have readily granted, that our first knowledge of their exis¬ tence was coeval with the first impressions made on our senses by external objects. That this was also the opinion of Descartes is still more evident, notwithstanding the ludicrous point of view in which Voltaire has attempted to exhibit this part of his system",Hercules,US,8,United States,North America
"Mr Locke seems to have considered this use of the word reflection as peculiar to himself; but it is perfectly analogous to the %ivr\(Siig xuxXhca/ of the Greek philosophers, and to various expres¬ sions which occur in the works of John Smith of Cambridge, and of Dr Cudworth.

"The only circumstance which renders these Notes worthy of preservation, is the record they furnish of Locke’s forbearance and courtesy, in managing a controversy carried on, upon the other side, with so much captiousness and aspe¬ rity. An Irish bishop, in a letter on this sub¬ ject to Mr Molyneux, writes thus: “ I read Mr Locke’s letter to the Bishop of Worcester with great satisfaction, and am wholly of your opi¬ nion, that he has fairly laid the great bishop on his back, but it is with so much gentleness, as if he were afraid not only of hurting him, hut even of spoiling or tumbling his clothes.” The work of Lee is entitled “ Anti-scepticism, or Notes upon each chapter of Mr Locke’s Es¬ say concerning Human Understanding, with an explanation of all the particulars of which he treats, and in the same order.

"For the information of some of my readers, it may be proper to observe, that the word influx came to be employed to denote the action of body and soul on each other, in consequence of a pre¬ vailing theory which supposed that this action was carried on by something intermediate (whe¬ ther material or immaterial was not positively decided) flowing from the one substance to the other. It is in this sense that the word is un¬ derstood by Leibnitz, when he states as an in¬ surmountable objection to the theory of influx, that “ it is impossible to conceive either mate¬ rial particles or immaterial qualities to pass from body to mind, or from mind to body.” Instead of the term influx, that of influence came gradually to be substituted by our English writers; but the two words were originally synonymous, and were used indiscriminately as late as the time of Sir Matthew Hale.—(See his Primitive Origination of Mankind.) In Johnson’s Dictionary, the primitive and radical meaning assigned to the word influence (which he considers as of French extraction) is “ the power of the celestial aspects operating upon terrestrial bodies and affairsand in the Encyclopaedia of Chambers, it is defined to be “ a quality supposed to flow from the bodies of the stars, either with their heat or light, to which astrologers vainly attribute all the events which happen on the earth.” To this astrolo¬ gical use of the word Milton had plainly a re¬ ference in that fine expression of his L’ Allegro, “ Store of ladies whose bright eyes “ Rain influence.1""1 It is a circumstance worthy of notice, that a word thus originating in the dreams of astro- r The explanation of the word influence, given in the Dictionary of the French Academy, accords perfectly with the tenor of the above remarks. “ Yertu qui, suivant les Astrologues, decoule des Astres sur les corps sublunaires.” DISSERTATION FIRST","Hale, Milton","GB,US,UK,FR",8,"United Kingdom,United States,N/A,France","Europe,North America,N/A,Europe"

"A similar remark is made by an ancient historian, with respect to the manners of Rome at the period of the Gothic invasion. 46 There are many who do not presume either to bathe, or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of Mercury, and the aspect of the Moon. It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the prophane sceptics, who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a Celestial Power.”—(Gibbon, from Ammianus Marcel- linus, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. V. p. 278.) Note 11, p. 139 The following estimate of Leibnitz, considered in comparison with his most distinguished con¬ temporaries, approaches, on the whole, very nearly to the truth; although some doubts may he entertained about the justness of the decision in the last clause of the sentence. 44 Leibnitz, aussi hardi que Descartes, aussi subtil que Bayle, peut-etre moins profond que Newton, et moins sage que Locke, mais seul universel entre Notes to us ces grand hommes, paroit avoir embrasse i]iUSt^ions le domaine de la raison dans toute son etendue, et avoir contribue le plus a repandre cet esprit philosophique que fait aujourd’hui la gloire de notre siecle.”—(Bailey, Ebgede Leibnitz.) I have mentioned in the text only a part of the learned labours of Leibnitz. It remains to he added, that he wrote also on various subjects connected with chemistry, medicine, botany, and natural history; on the philosophy and lan¬ guage of the Chinese; and on numberless other topics of subordinate importance.

"The studies by which he first distinguished himself in the learned world (I pass over that of jurisprudence,1 which was imposed on him by the profession for which he was destined) were directed to the antiquities of his own coun¬ try; and more particularly to those connected with the history of the house of Brunswick",Brunswick,US,8,United States,North America
"As an additional light for illustrating the an¬ tiquities of Germany, he had recourse to natu¬ ral history; examining, with a scientific eye, the shells and other marine bodies everywhere to be found in Europe, and the impressions of plants and fishes (some of them unknown in this part of the world) which are distinctly legible, even by the unlettered observer, on many of our fos¬ sils. In entering upon this research, as well as on the former, he seems to have had a view to Germany alone; on the state of which (he tells us), prior to all historical documents, it was his purpose to prefix a discourse to his History of the House of Brunswick. But his imagination soon took a bolder flight, and gave birth to his Protogo&a ;—a dissertation which (to use his own words) had for its object “ to ascertain the ori¬ ginal face of the earth, and to collect the ves¬ tiges of its earliest history from the monuments which nature herself has left of her successive operations on its surface.” It is a work which, wild and extravagant as it may now he regard- Notes ed, is spoken of by Buffon with much respect; IUu “adtiong> and is considered hy Cuvier as the ground-work of Buffon’s own system on the same subject",Brunswick,"DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"Of Locke’s affectionate regard for Collins notwithstanding the contrariety of their opinions on some questions of the highest moment, there exist many proofs in his letters, published by M Des Maizeaux. In one of these, the following passage is remarkable. It is dated from Oates in Essex, 1703, about a year before Locke’s death",Essex,US,8,United States,North America
"Does not this slight trait indicate very decidedly a tendency to insanity; a supposition by no means incompatible (as will he readily admitted by all who have paid any attention to the phe¬ nomena of madness) with that logical acumen which is so conspicuous in some of his writ¬ ings ? His irreligious principles he is supposed to have adopted, in the first instance, from his Latin preceptor Vander Ende, a physician and classical scholar of some eminence; hut it is much more probable, that his chief school of atheism was the synagogue of Amsterdam; where, without any breach of charity, a large proportion of the more opulent class of the as¬ sembly may he reasonably presumed to belong to the ancient sect of Sadducees. (This is, I presume, the idea of Heineccius in the followr- ing passage: “ Quamvis Spinoza Cartesii prin- cipia methodo mathematica demon strata dede- rit; Pantheismum tamen ille non ex Cartesio didicit, sed domi habuit, quos sequeretur” In proof of this, he refers to a book entitled Spi- nozismus in Judaismo, by Waechterus.) The blasphemous curses pronounced upon him in the sentence of excommunication were not well calculated to recal him to the faith of his ances¬ tors; and when combined with his early and hereditary prejudices against Christianity, may go far to account for the indiscriminate war which he afterwards waged against priests of all denominations",Amsterdam,US,8,United States,North America
"In proof of the impossibility of Liberty, Col¬ lins argues thus: “ A second reason to prove man a necessary agent is, because all his actions have a begin¬ ning. For whatever has a beginning must have a cause; and every cause is a necessary cause",Liberty,US,8,United States,North America
"“ If anything can have a beginning, which has no cause, then nothing can produce some¬ thing. And if nothing can produce something, then the world might have had a beginning without a cause; which is an absurdity not only charged on atheists, but is a real absurdity in itself.* * * * *Liberty, therefore, or a power to act or not to act, to do this or another thing under the same causes, is an impossibility and atheistical.1 “ And as Liberty stands, and can only be grounded on the absurd principles of Epicurean atheism; so the Epicurean atheists, who were the most popular and most numerous sect of the atheists of antiquity, were the great assertors of liberty; as, on the other side, the Stoics, who were the most popular and numerous sect among the religionaries of antiquity, were the great assertors of fate and necessity.”—(Col¬ lins, p. 54.) As to the above reasoning of Collins, it can¬ not he expected that I should, in the compass of a Note, “ hoult this matter to the bran.” It is sufficient here to remark, that it derives all its plausibility from the unqualified terms in which the maxim (/A^ev uminov) has frequently been stated. “ In the idea of every change (says Dr Price, a zealous advocate for the freedom of the will) is included that of its being an effect.” (Review, fyc. p. 30, 3d edition.) If this maxim he literally admitted without any explanation or restriction, it seems difficult to resist the con¬ clusions of the Necessitarians. The proper statement of Price’s maxim evidently is, that 1 To the same purpose Edwards attempts to show, that “ the scheme of free-will (by affording an exception to that dic¬ tate of common sense which refers every event to a cause) would destroy the proof a posteriori for the being of God.” DISS.

"In confirmation of his assertion concerning the former, he refers to the following well known lines of Lucretius: Denique si semper motus connectitur omnis, &c. &c. (Lucret. Lib. 2. v. 251.; On the obscurity of this passage, and the in¬ consistencies involved in it, much might be said; but it is of more importance, on the pre¬ sent occasion, to remark its complete repug¬ nance to the whole strain and spirit of the Epi¬ curean Philosophy. This repugnance did not escape the notice of Cicero, who justly consi¬ ders Epicurus as having contributed more to establish, by this puerile subterfuge, the autho¬ rity of Fatalism, than if he had left the argu¬ ment altogether untouched. “ Nec vero quis- qnam magis con firm are mild videtur non modo fatum, verum etiam necessitatem et vim om¬ nium rerum, sustulisseque motus animi volun¬ taries, quam hie qui aliter obsistere fato fatetur se non potuisse nisi ad has commenticias decli- nationes confugisset.”—(Liber de Fato, cap. 20.) On the noted expression of Lucretius (fatis Notes avolsa voluntas) some acute remarks are made Illus^ldions in a note on the French translation by M. de la Grange. They are not improbably from the pen of the Baron d’Holbach, who is said to have contributed many notes to this translation",Cicero,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"“ On est surpris qu’ Epicure fonde la liberte humaine sur la declinaison des atomes. On de- mande si cette d6clinaison est necessaire, ou si elle est simplement accidentelle. Necessaire, comment la liberte peut elle en etre le resultat ? Accidentelle, par quoi est elle determinee ? Mais on devrait bien plutot etre surpris, qu’il lui soit venu en idee de rendre 1’homme fibre dans un systeme qui suppose un enchainement necessaire de causes et d’effets. C’etoit une recherche curieuse, que la raison qui a pu faire d’Epicure 1’Apdtre de la Liberte.” For the theory which follows on this point, I must refer to the work in question.—(See Traduction Nou- velle de Lucrece, avec des Notes, par M. de la Grange, Vol. I. pp. 218, 219, 220, a Paris, 1768.) But whatever may have been the doctrines of some of the ancient Atheists about man’s free- agency, it will not be denied, that in the History of Modern Philosophy, the schemes of Atheism and of Necessity have been hitherto always con¬ nected together. Not that I would by any means be understood to say, that every Neces¬ sitarian must ipso facto he an Atheist, or even that any presumption is afforded by a man’s at¬ tachment to the former sect, of his having the slightest bias in favour of the latter; hut only that every modern Atheist I have heard of has been a Necessitarian. I cannot help adding, that the most consistent Necessitarians who have yet appeared, have been those who follow¬ ed out their principles till they ended in Spino¬ zism, a doctrine which differs from atheism more in words than in reality",Paris,US,8,United States,North America

"We are told by Dr Priestley, in the very in¬ teresting Memoirs of his own Life, that he was educated in the strict principles of Calvinism; and yet it would appear, that while he remained a Calvinist, he entertained no doubt of his being a free-agent. “ The doctrine of Necessity,” he also tells us, “ he first learned from Collins ; * and was established in the belief of it by Hart¬ ley’s Observations on Man.”—(Ibid. p. 19.) He farther mentions in another work, that 44 he was not a ready convert to the doctrine of Necessity, and that, like Dr Hartley himself, he gave up his liberty with great reluctance.”—{Preface to the Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated, 2d edit. Birmingham, 1782, p. xxvii.) These instances afford a proof, I do not say of the compatibility of man’s free-agency with those schemes with which it seems most at variance, but of this compatibility in the opinion of some of the profoundest thinkers who have turned their attention to the argument. No conclusion, therefore, can be drawn against a man’s belief in his own free-agency, from his embracing other metaphysical or theological tenets, with which 1 Collins states this more strongly in what he says of the Pharisees. “ The Pharisees, who were a religious sect, as¬ cribed all things to fate or to God’s appointment, and it was the first article of their creed, that Fate and God do all, and, consequently, they could not assert a true liberty when they asserted a liberty together with this fatality and necessity of all things.”—(Collins, p. 54.) 2 We are elsewhere informed by Priestley, that “it was in consequence of reading and studying the Inquiry of Collins, he was first convinced of the truth of the doctrine of Necessity, and was enabled to see the fallacy of most of the arguments m favour of Philosophical Liberty: though (he adds) I was much more confirmed in this principle by my acquaintance with Hartley’s Theory of the Human Mind: a work to which I owe much more than I am able to express.”—(Preface, &c","Man, Birmingham","CI,US",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,United States","Africa,North America"

A strong in¬ stance of his want of accuracy appears in the manner in which he opens the subject. For what meaning is there in things exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from any¬ thing that exists in the objects ?

"Ideas, it is agreed on all hands, can exist no¬ where hut in the mind. What Mr Locke’s phi¬ losophy teaches, and what our author should have said, is, exciting in us many ideas of qualities which are different from anything that exists in the objects.” Let us now attend to Locke’s theory, as stated by himself:— “ From whence I think it is easy to draw this observation, That the ideas of primary qua¬ lities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their patterns do really exist in the bodies them¬ selves, but the ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all. There is nothing like our ideas existing in the bodies themselves. They are in the bodies we denominate from them, only a power to produce these sensations in us. And what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, is hut the cer¬ tain hulk, figure, and motion of the insensible parts in the bodies themselves, which we call so.” The inaccuracy of Locke in conceiving that our ideas of primary qualities are resemblances of these qualities, and that the patterns of such ideas exist in the bodies themselves, has been fully exposed by Dr Reid.

To all, however, who understand the subject, it must appear evident, that Addison has, in this instance, improved greatly on Locke, by keeping out of view what is most exception¬ able in his language, while he has retained all that is solid in his doctrine. For my own part, I do not see how Addison’s expressions could be altered to the better, except, perhaps, by substi¬ tuting the words unlike to, instead of different from. But in this last phrase, Addison has been implicitly followed by Dr Blair, and certainly would not have been disavowed as an interpre¬ ter by Locke himself. Let me add, that Dr Blair’s proposed emendation (“ exciting in us many ideas of qualities, which are different from any thing that exists in the objects”), if not wholly unintelligible, deviates much farther from Locke’s meaning than the correspondent clause in its original state.

The remarks are numerous, and show much reading. The Appendix contains, 1. An ex¬ position of the opinion of the Idealists, with its grounds and arguments 2. A proof of the external existence of body. The argument on which he chiefly dwells to show the existence of matter is the same with that of Hr Reid, in so far as he says, “ a direct proof must not here he expected; in regard to the fundamental prin ciples of human nature, this is seldom possible, or rather is absolutely impossible.” He argues at length, that the Idealist has no better proof of the existence of his soul than of the existence of his body; “ when an Idealist says, lama thinking being; of this I am certain from internal conviction ;—I would ask from whence he derives this certainty, and why he excludes from this conviction the possi¬ bility of deception ? He has no other answer than this, I feel it. It is impossible that I can have any representation of self without the consciousness of being a thinking being.

"46, 47.) A late author2 has very justly reprobated that spiritual deification of nature which has been long fashionable among the French, and which, according to his own account, is at present not unfashionable in Germany. It is proper, how¬ ever, to observe, that this mode of speaking has been used by two very ditferent classes of wri¬ ters ; by the one with an intention to keep as much as possible the Deity out of their view, while studying his works; by the other, as a convenient and well understood metaphor, by means of which the frequent and irreverent mention of the name of God is avoided in philo¬ sophical arguments. It was with this last view, undoubtedly, that it was so often employed by Newton, and other English philosophers of the same school. In general, when we find a wri¬ ter speaking of the wise or of the benevolent in¬ tentions of nature, we should be slow in imput¬ ing to him any leaning towards atheism. Many of the finest instances of Final Causes, it is cer¬ tain, which the eighteenth century has brought to light, have been first remarked by inquirers who seem to have been fond of this phraseology; and of these inquirers, it is possible that some would have been less forward in bearing testi¬ mony to the truth, had they been forced to avail themselves of the style of theologians. These speculations, therefore, concerning the intentions Notes or designs of Nature, how reprehensible soever illustrations, and even absurd in point of strict logic the lan- guage may be in which they are expressed, may often be, nay, have often been, a step towards something higher and better ; and, at any rate, are of a character totally different from the blind chance of the Epicureans, or the conflicting principles of the Manicheans Note X X, p. 195",Newton,"DE,US,FR,UK",8,"Germany,United States,France,N/A","Europe,North America,Europe,N/A"
"Notes cannot reconcile it with what he says in Prop, illustrations t^iat the conception of Space is the founda- tion of all the truth we ascribe to our percep¬ tions of external objects. (The author’s own words are—omnis veritatis in sensualitate ex¬ terna fundamentum I”)1 2 Upon the whole, it appears to me, that, among these various propositions, there are some which are quite unintelligible; that others assume, as first principles, doctrines which have been dis¬ puted by many of our most eminent philoso¬ phers ; that others, again, seem to aim at in- i volving plain and obvious truths in darkness and mystery; and that not one is expressed with simplicity and precision, which are the na¬ tural results of clear and accurate thinking. In considering time and space as the forms of all sensible phenomena, does Kant mean any thing more but this,—that we necessarily refer every sensible phenomenon to some point of space, or to some instant of time ? If this was really his meaning, he has only repeated over, in obscurer language, the following propositions of Newton; “ Ut or do partium temporis est immutabilis, sic etiam ordo partium spatii. Moveantur hsec de locis suis, et movebuntur (ut ita dicam) de seipsis. Nam tempora et spatia sunt sui ipsorum et rerum omnium quasi loca. In tempore, quoad ordinem successionis; in spatio, quoad ordinem situs locantur universa. De illorum essentia est ut sint loca: et loca primaria mover! absur- dum est.” I have quoted this passage, not from any de¬ sire of displaying the superiority of Newton over Kant, but chiefly to show how very nearly the powers of the former sink to the same level with those of the latter, when directed to inqui¬ ries unfathomable by the human faculties","Kant, Newton, Newton, Kant","KG,US",8,"Kyrgyzstan,United States","Asia,North America"

"But this is concluding by far too much from these premises. If there be no external space, it will follow, that we are not authorised to assign extension to external things, but there will follow no more.” (p. 149.) Mr Nitsch then proceeds to obviate these objections ; but his reply is far from satisfactory, and is indeed not less applicable to the doctrine of Berkeley than to that of Kant.

"When the above passage was written, I had not seen the work of Buhle.

The account there given of the Kantian system, to which I turned with peculiar eagerness, has, if possible, involved to my apprehension, in additional ob¬ scurity, that mysterious doctrine. From this, however, I did not feel myself entitled to form an estimate of the author’s merits as a philo¬ sophical historian, till I had read some other articles of which I considered myself better qualified to j udge.

"By this means that vulgar error would be avoid¬ ed of putting nothing but nonsense into the mouth of the adversary; and, at the same time, a variety of character and genius being upheld, would make the whole look more natural and unaffected.

I believe, too, we could both of us have kept our tempers very well; only you have not reached an absolute philosophical indiffe¬ rence on these points. What danger can ever come from ingenious reasoning and inquiry ? The worst speculative sceptic ever I knew was a much better man than the best superstitious devotee and bigot. I must inform you too, that this was the way of thinking of the ancients on this subject. If a man made profession of phi¬ losophy, whatever his sect was, they always ex¬ pected to find more regularity in his life and Notes manners than in those of the ignorant and illi- iuus^ations terate. There is a remarkable passage of Ap- pian to this purpose.

But I find, upon inquiry, that Critias was a professed Atheist, and Aris¬ tion an Epicurean, which is little or nothing different; and yet Appian wonders at their cor¬ ruption as much as if they had been Stoics or Platonists.

"“ I am sorry our correspondence should lead us into these abstract speculations. I have thought, and read, and composed very little on such questions of late. Morals, politics, and literature, have employed all my time; but still the other topics I must think more curious, im¬ portant, entertaining, and useful, than any geo¬ metry that is deeper than Euclid. If, in order to answer the douhts started, new principles of philosophy must be laid, are not these doubts themselves very useful? Are they not prefer¬ able to blind and ignorant assent? I hope I can answer my own doubts; but, if I could not, is it to be wondered at? To give myself airs and speak magnificently; might I not observe that Columbus did not conquer empires and plant colonies ? “ If I have not unravelled the knot so well in these last papers I sent you, as perhaps I did in the former, it has not, I assure you, proceed¬ ed from want of good will.

"“ The late Mr Dugald Stewart and Mr Playfair had agreed to furnish Dissertations, the one on the history of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy, the other on the history of Mathematical and Physical Science, to be prefixed to the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The design was not completed by either of those illus¬ trious writers. Both died before their respective portions of it were finished. The history of the mathematical and physical sciences, by the latter, was brought down to the period marked by the discoveries of Newton and Leibnitz ; and the history of metaphysical philosophy was, by the former, brought down to the close of the last cen¬ tury. In treating this great branch of his subject, Mr Stewart has occasionally ad¬ verted to the kindred branches of ethics and politics; but there was wanting to the completion of his design a full view of the progress of opinion in those sciences, par¬ ticularly during the eighteenth century. In 1828, a new and improved edition of the Encyclopaedia, being the seventh, was projected, and it was a part of the Editor’s plan for the improvement of this edition, to continue the magnificent historical Disserta¬ tions that had been published with the Supplement, and to prefix the whole, in their completed form, to this edition of the principal work. A proposal to write a Disserta¬ tion in continuation of that of Mr Stewart upon the Ethical and Political Philosophy of the last century, was, in August 1828, accordingly made to Sir James, by the Editor, 294 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But this can happen only by considering mo¬ ral good as a primary object, valuable for its own sake; not by supposing that virtue is aimed at, as subservient to some other purpose of more genuine utility: and no sagacity or fairness in estimating useful consequences can stand as a substitute for the love of right itself. It is true, that honesty is the best policy; but he who is honest only out of policy, does not come up even to the vulgar notion of a virtuous man. If a man were tempted by the opportunity of gaining a large estate through a safe but fraudulent pro¬ ceeding, the utilitarian doctrine would seem to recommend him to Aveigh both sides well, though it would direct him in conclusion to decide in fa¬ vour of probity; but the common judgment of mankind would hardly deem him honest if he hesitated at all. And in like manner in regard to other temptations, the safety of virtue appears to consist so little in tracing all possible conse¬ quences, that it has been held, that to deliberate is to be lost, and that the only secure protection is that purity of mind which will not look at the prospect of sensual pleasure when it forms one side of the account. We cannot help saying with Cicero, “ Ilaec nonne est turpe dubitare philosophos, quse ne rustici quidem dubitent \ ” {Off. m. 19.) Indeed, it appears to be acknowledged by the advocates of the rule of utility, that it is not safe to apply the principle separately in each parti¬ cular case. Mr Bentham has urged with great beauty of expression {Deontology, vol. ii., ch. i.), the propriety of framing general rules, and con¬ forming our practice invariably to these, so as to avoid the temptations of our frailty and passion in particular instances. If a reverence for gene¬ ral maxims of morality, and a constant reference to the common precepts of virtue, take the place, in the utilitarian’s mind, of the direct applica¬ tion of his principle, there will remain little dif¬ ference between him and the believer in original moral distinctions ; for the practical rules of the two will rarely differ, and in both systems the rules will be the moral guides of thought and conduct",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"The celebrated comparison of the mind to a sheet of white paper is not just, except we consider that there may be in the paper itself many cir¬ cumstances which affect the nature of the writing (p. 380). A recent writer, however, appears to me to have supplied us with a much more apt and beautiful comparison. Man’s soul at first, says Professor Sedgwick, is one unvaried blank, till it has received the impressions of external experience. “ Yet has this blank,” he adds, “ been already touched by a celestial hand ; and, when plunged in the colours which surround it, it takes not its tinge from accident but design, and comes out covered with a glorious pattern.” —{Discourse on the Studies of the University, p. 54.)

"definition is faintly and but occasionally present, naturally suffers, in the ordinary state of atten¬ tion, the scientific meaning to disappear from remembrance, and insensibly ascribes to the word a great part, if not the whole, of that po¬ pular sense which is so very much more familiar even to the most veteran speculator. The ob¬ stacles which stood in the way of Lucretius and Cicero, when they began to translate the subtile philosophy of Greece into their narrow and bar¬ ren tongue, are always felt by the philosopher when he struggles to express, with the neces¬ sary discrimination, his abstruse reasonings in words which, though those of his own language, be must take from the mouths of those to whom his distinctions would be without meaning",Cicero,"GR,US",8,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"The application to moral qualities of terms which denote outward beauty, though by him perhaps carried to excess, is an illustrative me¬ taphor, as well warranted by the poverty of lan¬ guage as any other employed to signify the acts or attributes of mind.1 The beautiful in his language denoted all that of which the mere contemplation is in itself delightful, without any admixture of organic pleasure, and without being regarded as the means of attaining any farther end. The feeling which belongs to it he called love; a word which, as comprehending compla¬ cency, benevolence, and affection, and reaching from the neighbourhood of the senses to the most sublime of human thoughts, is foreign from the colder and more exg.ct language of our philoso¬ phy ; but which perhaps then happily served to lure both the lovers of poetry and the votaries of superstition to the school of truth and good¬ ness in the groves of the Academy. He enforced .these lessons by an inexhaustible variety of just and beautiful illustrations,—sometimes striking from their familiarity, sometimes subduing by their grandeur; and his works are the store¬ house from which moralists have from age to age borrowed the means of rendering moral in¬ struction easier and more delightful. Virtue he represented as the harmony of the whole soul;— as a peace between all its principles and desires, assigning to each as much space as they can oc¬ cupy, without encroaching on each other;—as a state of perfect health, in which every function was performed with ease, pleasure, and vigour ; —as a well-ordered commonwealth, where the obedient passions executed with energy the laws and commands of reason. The vicious mind presented the odious character, sometimes of dis¬ cord, of war;—sometimes of disease;—always of passions warring with each other in eternal anarchy. Consistent with himself, and at peace with his fellows, the good man felt in the quiet of his conscience a foretaste of the approbation of God. “ Oh what ardent love would virtue inspire if s|ie could be seen.” “ If the heart of a tyrant could be laid bare, we should see how it was cut and torn by its own evil passions and by an avenging conscience.” 2 * * * * * Perhaps in every one of these illustrations, an eye trained in the history of Ethics may discover the germ of the whole or of a part of some sub¬ sequent theory. But to examine it thus would not be to look at it with the eye of Plato. His aim was as practical as that of Socrates. He employed every topic, without regard to its place in a system, or even always to its force as argument, which could attract the small portion of the community then accessible to cultivation; who, it should not be forgotten, had no moral instructor but the philosopher, unaided, if not thwarted, by the reigning superstition: for reli¬ gion had not then, besides her own discoveries, brought down the most awful and the most beautiful forms of moral truth to the humblest station in human society.8 Ethics retained her sober spirit in the hands of his great scholar and rival Aristotle, who, 1 The most probable etymology of seems to be from to burn. What burns commonly shines. Schon, in Ger¬ man, which means beautiful, is derived from scheinen, to shine. The word was used for right, so early as the Home¬ ric Poems. II. xvii. 19.

"There is no scene in history so memorable as that in which Caesar mastered a nobility of which Lucullus and Hortensius, Sulpicius and Catulus, Pompey and Cicero, Brutus and Cato, were members. This renowned body had from the time of Scipio sought the Greek philosophy as an amusement or an ornament. Some few, <c in thought more elevate,” caught the love of truth, and were ambitious of discovering a solid foundation for the Rule of Life. The influence of the Grecian systems was tried by their effect on a body of men of the utmost originality, energy, and variety of character, during the five centuries between Carneades and Constantine, in their successive positions of rulers of the world, and of slaves under the best and under the worst of uncontrolled masters. If we had found this in¬ fluence perfectly uniform, we should have justly suspected our own love of system of having in part bestowed that appearance on it. Had there been no trace of such an influence discoverable in so great an experiment, we must have acquiesced in the paradox, that opinion does not at all affect conduct.

"Though Cassius was an Epicurean, the true re¬ presentative of that school was the accomplished, prudent, friendly, good-natured timeserver At- ticus, the pliant slave of every tyrant, who could kiss the hand of Antony, imbrued as it was in the blood of Cicero. The pure school of Plato sent forth Marcus Brutus, the signal humanity of whose life was both necessary and sufficient to prove that his daring breach of venerable rules flowed only from that dire necessity which left no other means of upholding the most sacred principles. The Roman orator, though in spe¬ culative questions ho embraced that mitigated doubt which allowed most ease and freedom to his genius, yet in those moral writings where his heart was most deeply interested, followed the severest sect of philosophy, and became al¬ most a Stoic. If any conclusion may he ha¬ zarded from this trial of systems, the greatest which history has recorded, we must not refuse our decided though not undistinguishing pre¬ ference to that noble school which preserved great souls untainted at the court of dissolute and ferocious tyrants; which exalted the slave of one of Nero’s courtiers to he a moral teacher of aftertimes; which for the first, and hitherto for the only time, breathed philosophy and jus¬ tice into those rules of law which govern the ordinary concerns of every man; and which, above all, has contributed, by the examples of Marcus Porcius Cato and of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, to raise the dignity of our species, to keep alive a more ardent love of virtue, and a more awful sense of duty, throughout all ge¬ nerations. 1 4 The result of this short review of the practi¬ cal philosophy of Greece seems to be, that though it was rich in rules for the conduct of life, and in exhibitions of the beauty of virtue, and though it contains glimpses of j ust theory and fragments of perhaps every moral truth, yet it did not leave behind any precise and coherent system; un¬ less we except that of Epicurus, who purchased consistency, method, and perspicuity too dearly by the sacrifice of truth, and by narrowing and lowering his views of human nature, so as to enfeeble, if not extinguish, all the vigorous mo¬ tives to arduous virtue. It is remarkable, that while of the eight Professors who taught in the Porch, from Zeno to Posidonius, everyone either softened or exaggerated the doctrines of his pre¬ decessor ; and while the beautiful and reverend philosophy of Plato had, in his own Academy, degenerated into a scepticism which did not spare morality itself, the system of Epicurus re¬ mained without change; and his disciples con¬ tinued for ages to show personal honours to his memory, in a manner which may seem unac¬ countable among those who were taught to measure propriety by a calculation of palpable _1 Of all testimonies to the character of the Stoics, perhaps the most decisive is the speech of the vile sycophant Ca- pito, in the mock impeachment of Thrasea Paetus, before a senate of slaves: “ Ut quondam C. Caesarem et M. Catonem, ita nunc te, Nero, et Thraseam, avida discordiarum civitas loquitur...Ista secta Tuberones et Favonios, veteri quoque m- publicae ingrata nomina, genuit.” (Tacit.

"The genius of Greece fell with liberty. The Grecian philosophy received its mortal wound in the contests between scepticism and dogma¬ tism which occupied the schools in the age of Cicero. The Sceptics could only perplex, and confute, and destroy. Their occupation was gone as soon as they succeeded. They had nothing to substitute for what they overthrew; and they rendered their own art of no further use. They were no more than venomous ani¬ mals, who stung their victims to death, but also breathed their last into the wound. A third age of Grecian literature indeed arose at Alex¬ andria, under the Macedonian kings of Egypt; laudably distinguished by exposition, criticism, and imitation, sometimes abused for the pur¬ poses of literary forgery, still more honoured by some learned and highly-cultivated poets, as well as by diligent cultivators of history and science; among whom some began about the first preaching of Christianity to turn their minds once more to that high philosophy which seeks for the fundamental principles of human knowledge. Philo, a learned and philosophical Hebrew, one of the flourishing colony of his na¬ tion established in that city, endeavoured to re¬ concile the Platonic Philosophy with the Mosaic Law and the Sacred Books of the Old Testa¬ ment. About the end of the second century, when the Christians, Hebrews, Pagans, and va¬ rious other sects of semi or Pseudo-Christian Gnostics appear to have studied in the same schools, the almost inevitable tendency of doc¬ trines, however discordant, in such circum¬ stances to amalgamate, produced its full effect under Ammonius Saccas; a celebrated Professor, who, by selection from the Greek systems, the Hebrew books, the oriental religions, and by some of that concession to the rising spirit of Christi¬ anity, of which the Gnostics had set the example, composed a very mixed system, commonly de- 1 The progress of commonplace satire on sexes or professions, and (he might have added) on nations, has been exquisitely touched by Gray in his Remarks on Lydgate ; a fragment containing passages as finely thought and written as any in Eng¬ lish prose.

"3 The steps of this important progress, as far as relates to Athens and Rome, are well remarked by one of the finest of the Roman writers. “ Quern enim Romanorum pudet uxorem ducere in convivium ? aut cujus materfamilias non primum locum tenet sedium, atque in celebritate versatur ? quod multo fit aliter in Graecia; nam neque in convivium adhibetur, nisi propinquorum, neque sedet nisi in interiore parte aedium, quse Gynaeconitis appellatur, quo nemo accedit, nisi propinqua cognatione conjunctus.” (Cornel.

If he had turned to civil institutions, he might have learned that some nations had preserved an ancient, simple, and seemingly rude mode of legal proceeding, which threw into the hands of the majority of men a far larger share of judicial power than was enjoyed by them in any ancient democracy. He would have seen everywhere the remains of that principle of representation, the glory of the Teutonic race, by which popular government, anciently im¬ prisoned in cities, became capable of being strengthened by its extension over vast coun¬ tries, to which experience cannot even now assign any limits; and which, in times still dis¬ tant, was to exhibit, in the newly-discovered continent, a republican confederacy, likely to surpass the Macedonian and Roman empires in extent, greatness, and duration, but gloriously founded on the equal rights, not like them on the universal subjection, of mankind. In one respect, indeed, he might have lamented that the race of man had made a really retrograde movement; that they had lost the liberty of philosophizing; that the open exercise of their highest faculties was interdicted. But he might also have perceived that this giant evil had re¬ ceived a mortal wound from Luther, who in his warfare against Rome had struck a blow against all human authority, and unconsciously dis¬ closed to mankind that they were entitled, or rather bound, to form and utter their own opin¬ ions, and most of all on the most deeply in¬ teresting subjects: for although this most fruit¬ ful of moral truths was not yet so released from its combination with the wars and passions of the age as to assume a distinct and visible form, its action was already discoverable in the divisions among the Reformers, and in the fears and struggles of civil and ecclesiastical oppressors","Roman, Rome","RO,US,MK",8,"Romania,United States,North Macedonia","Europe,North America,Europe"

"In the first moiety of the middle age, the dark¬ ness of Christendom was faintly broken by a few thinly-scattered lights. Even then, Moses Ben Maimon taught philosophy among the persecut¬ ed Hebrews, whose ancient schools had never perhaps been wholly interrupted; and a series of distinguished Mahometans, among whom two are known to us by the names of Avicenna and Averroes, translated the Peripatetic writings into their own language, expounded their doc¬ trines in no servile spirit to their followers, and 1 Tenneman, Geschichte dcr Philosophies VIII.

"327 were called Mystics. The greater part, driven back on themselves, had no better employment than to weave cobwebs out of the terms of art which they had vainly, though ingeniously, mul¬ tiplied. The institution of clerical celibacy, originating in an enthusiastic pursuit of purity, promoted by a mistake in moral prudence, which aimed at raising religious teachers in the esteem of their fellows, and at concentrating their whole minds on professional duties, at last, encouraged by the ambitious policy of the see of Rome, de¬ sirous of detaching them from all ties but her own, had the effect of shutting up all the avenues which Providence has opened for the entrance of social affection and virtuous feeling into the human heart. Though this institution perhaps prevented knowledge from becoming once more the exclusive inheritance of a sacerdotal caste; though the rise of innumerable laymen, of the lowest condition, to the highest dignities of the church, was the grand democratical principle of the middle age, and one of the most powerful agents in impelling mankind towards a better order; yet celibacy must be considered as one of the peculiar infelicities of these secluded philo¬ sophers; not only as it abridged their happiness, nor even solely, though chiefly, as it excluded them from the school in which the heart is hu¬ manized, but also (an inferior consideration, but more pertinent to our present purpose) because the extinction of these moral feelings was as much a subtraction from the moralist’s store of facts and means of knowledge, as the loss of sight or of touch could prove to those of the naturalist","Rome, Providence",US,8,United States,North America
"We ought not so much to wonder at the mis¬ takes of men so situated, as that they, without the restraints of the general understanding, and with the clogs of system and establishment, should in so many instances have opened ques¬ tions untouched by the more unfettered ancients, and veins of speculation since mistakenly sup¬ posed to have been first explored in more mo¬ dern times. Scarcely any metaphysical contro¬ versy agitated among recent philosophers was unknown to the schoolmen, unless we except that which relates to liberty and necessity, which would be an exception of doubtful propriety ; for the disposition to it is clearly discoverable in the disputes of the Thomists and Scotists re¬ specting the Augustinian and Pelagian doc¬ trines, 1 although restrained from the avowal of legitimate consequences on either side by the theological authority which both parties acknow¬ ledged. The Scotists steadily affirmed the blame¬ lessness of erroneous opinion; a principle which is the only effectual security for conscientious inquiry, for mutual kindness, and for public quiet. The controversy between the Nominal¬ ists and Realists, treated by some modern wri¬ ters as an example of barbarous wrangling, was in truth an anticipation of that modern dispute which still divides metaphysicians, whether the human mind can form general ideas, and whe¬ ther the words which are supposed to convey such ideas he not general terms, representing only a number of particular perceptions?—ques¬ tions so far from frivolous, that they deeply con¬ cern both the nature of reasoning and the struc¬ ture of language;—on which Hobbes, Berkeley, Hume, Stewart, and Tooke, have followed the Nominalists; and Descartes, Locke, Reid, and Kant, have, with various modifications and some inconsistencies, adopted the doctrine of the Realists.2 3 With the schoolmen appears to have originated the form, though not the substance, of the celebrated maxim, which, whether true or false, is pregnant with systems, <c There is nothing in the understanding which was not be¬ fore in the senses.”5 Ockham4 the Nominalist first denied the Peripatetic doctrine of the exist¬ ence of certain species (since the time of Des¬ cartes called ideas) as the direct objects of per¬ ception and thought, interposed between the mind and outward objects; the modern oppo¬ sition to which by Dr Reid has been supposed to justify the allotment of so high a station to that respectable philosopher. He taught also that we know nothing of mind hut its acts, of which we are conscious. More inclination towards an independent philosophy is to be traced among the schoolmen than might he ex¬ pected from their circumstances. Those who follow two guides will sometimes choose for themselves, and may prefer the subordinate on some occasions. Aristotle rivalled the church; and the church herself safely allowed consider¬ able latitude to the philosophical reasonings of those who were only heard or read in colleges or cloisters, on condition that they neither im¬ pugned her authority, nor dissented from her worship, nor departed from the language of her creeds. The Nominalists were a freethinking sect, who, notwithstanding their defence of kings against the court of Rome, were perse¬ cuted by the civil power. It should not he for¬ gotten that Luther was a Nominalist.5 If not more remarkable, it is more pertinent to our purpose, that the ethical system of the schoolmen, or, to speak more properly, of Aqui¬ nas, as the moral master of Christendom for three centuries, was in its practical part so ex¬ cellent as to leave little need of extensive change, 1 Notes and Illustrations, note I","Berkeley, Kant, Rome","US,KG",8,"United States,Kyrgyzstan","North America,Asia"
"Though these still continued to be published, yet the most remarkable moralists of the six¬ teenth century indicated the approach of other modes of thinking, by the adoption of the more independent titles of Treatises on Justice and Law. These titles were suggested, and the spirit, contents, and style of the writings them¬ selves, were materially affected by the improved cultivation of the Roman law, by the renewed study of ancient literature, and by the revival of various systems of Greek philosophy, now studied in the original, which at once mitigated and rivalled the scholastic doctors, and while they rendered philosophy more free, re-opened its communications with society and affairs.

"Many of these writers treated the law of war and the practice of hostilities in a juridical form.1 Francis Victoria, who began to teach at Valla¬ dolid in 1525, is said to have first expounded the doctrines of the schools in the language of the age of Leo the Tenth. Dominic Soto,2 * a Do¬ minican, the confessor of Charles V., and the oracle of the Council of Trent, to whom that assembly were indebted for much of the preci¬ sion and even elegance for which their doctrinal decrees are not unjustly commended, dedicated his treatise on Justice and Law to Don Car¬ los ; in terms of praise which, used hy a writer who is said to have declined the high dignities of the church, lead us to hope that he was un¬ acquainted with the brutish vices of that wretch¬ ed prince. It is a concise and not inelegant compound of the scholastic Ethics, which con¬ tinued to be of considerable authority for more than a century.5 Both he and his master Vic¬ toria deserve to be had in everlasting remem- tyance, for the part which they took on behalt of the natives of America and of Africa, against the rapacity and cruelty of the Spaniards. Vic¬ toria pronounced war against the Americans for their vices or for their paganism to be unjust.4 Soto was the authority chiefly consulted by Charles V., on occasion of the conference held before him at Valladolid, in 1542, between Se¬ pulveda, an advocate of the Spanish colonists, and Las Casas, the champion of the unhappy Americans ; of which the result was a very im¬ perfect edict of reformation in 1543, which, though it contained little more than a recogni¬ tion of the principle of justice, almost excited a rebellion in Mexico. Sepulveda, a scholar and a reasoner, advanced many maxims which were specious, and in themselves reasonable, but which practically tended to defeat even the scanty and almost illusive reform which en¬ sued. Las Casas was a passionate missionary, whose zeal, kindled by the long and near con¬ templation of cruelty, prompted him to exagge¬ rations of fact and argument;5 yet, with all its errors, it afforded the only hope of preserving the natives of America from extirpation. The opin¬ ion of Soto could not fail to be conformable to his excellent principle, that “ there can be no difference between Christians and Pagans, for the law of nations is equal to all nations.”6 To Soto belongs the signal honour of being the first writer who condemned the African slave-trade","Vic, Vic, Valladolid","ES,MX",8,"Spain,Mexico","Europe,North America"
"“ It is affirmed,” says he, “ that the unhappy Ethiopians are by fraud or force carried away and sold as slaves.

"The introduction to the great work of Gro¬ tius, 6 composed in the first years of his exile, and published at Paris in 1625, contains the most clear and authentic statement of the general principles of morals prevalent in Christendom after the close of the schools, and before the writings of Hobbes had given rise to those ethi¬ cal controversies which more peculiarly belong to modern times. That he may lay down the fundamental principles of Ethics, he introduces Carneades on the stage as denying altogether the reality of moral distinctions; teaching that law and morality are contrived by powerful men for their own interest; that they vary in differ¬ ent countries, and change in successive ages; that there can be no natural law, since nature leads men as well as other animals to prefer their own interest to every other object; that therefore there is either no justice, or if there be, it is another name for the height of folly, 1 Born in 1538; died in 1617- 2 “ Tantse subtilitatis philosophum et theologum, ut vix quemquam habeat parent.” (Grotii Epist. apud Anton.

"Dr Richard Cumberland,2 raised to the see of Peterborough after the revolution of 1688, was the only professed answerer of Hobbes. His work on the Law of Nature still retains a place on the shelf, though not often on the desk. The philosophical epigrams of Hobbes form a con¬ trast to the verbose, prolix, and languid diction of his answerer. The forms of scholastic argu¬ ment serve more to encumber his style than to insure his exactness. But he has substantial merits. He justly observes, that all men can only be said to have had originally a right to all things, in a sense in which right has the same meaning with power. He shows that Hobbes is at variance with himself; inasmuch as the dic¬ tates of right reason, which, by his own state¬ ment, teach men for their own safety to forego the exercise of that right, and which he calls Laws of Nature, are coeval with it; and that mankind perceive the moral limits of their power as clearly and as soon as they are conscious of its existence. He enlarges the intimations of Grotius on the social feelings, which prompt men to the pleasures of pacific intercourse, as certainly as the apprehension of danger and de¬ struction urges them to avoid hostility.

"From this principle he deduces the rules of mo¬ rality, which he calls the Laws of Nature. The surest, or rather only mark that they are the commandments of God, is, that their observance promotes the happiness of man : for that reason alone could they he imposed by that Being whose essence is love. As our moral faculties must to us be the measure of all moral excellence, he infers that the moral attributes of the Divinity must in theirnatureheonly a transcendent degree of those qualities which we most approve, love, and revere, in those moral agents with whom we are familiar. * He had a momentary glimpse of the possibility that some human actions might he performed with a view to the happiness of others, without any consideration of the pleasure reflected back on ourselves.3 But it is too faint and transient to he worthy of observation, other¬ wise than as a new proof how often great truths must flit before the understanding, before they can be firmly and finally held in its grasp. His only attempt to explain the nature of the moral faculty, is the substitution of practical reason (a phrase of the schoolmen, since become celebrat¬ ed from its renewal by Kant) for right reason ;4 and his definition of the first, as that which points out the ends and means of action. Throughout his whole reasoning, he adheres to the accustom¬ ed confusion of the quality which renders actions virtuous, with the sentiments excited in us by the contemplation of them. His language on the identity of general and individual interest is ex¬ tremely vague; though it be, as he says, the foundation-stone of the Temple of Concord among men","Kant, Temple, Concord","US,KG",8,"United States,Kyrgyzstan","North America,Asia"
"It is little wonder that Cumberland should not have disembroiled this ancient and established confusion, since Leibnitz himself, in a passage where he reviews the theories of morals which had gone before him, has done his utmost to perpetuate it. “It is a question,” says he, “ whether the preservation of human society be the first principle of the law of nature. This our author denies, in opposition to Grotius, who laid down sociability to be so; to Hobbes, who ascribed that character to mutual fear; and to Cumberland, who held that it was mutual bene¬ volence ; which are all three only different names for the safety and welfare of society.”5 Here the great philosopher considered benevolence or fear, two feelings of the human mind, to be the first principles of the law of nature; in the same sense in which the tendency of certain actions to the wellbeing of the community may he so regarded. The confusion, however, was then common to him with many, as it even now is with most. The comprehensive view was his own. He perceives the close resemblance of these various and even conflicting opinions, in that important point of view in which they re¬ late to the effects of moral and immoral actions on the general interest. The tendency of virtue to preserve amicable intercourse was enforced by Grotius; its tendency to prevent injury was dwelt on by Hobbes; its tendency to promote an interchange of benefits was inculcated by Cumberland","Cumberland, Cumberland, Cumberland",US,8,United States,North America
"The first generation of their scholars turned their attention too much from the cultivation of the heart to the mere government of outward action; and in succeeding times the tolerant spirit, not natural to an establishment, was with difficulty kept up by a government whose ex¬ istence depended on discouraging intolerant pre¬ tensions. No sooner had the first sketch of the Hobbian phildsophy5 been privately circulated at Paris, than Cudworth seized the earliest oppor¬ tunity of sounding the alarm against the most justly odious of the modes of thinking which it cultivates, or forms of expression which it would introduce;4 the prelude to a war which occu¬ pied the remaining forty years of his life. The Intellectual System, his great production, is di¬ rected against the atheistical opinions of Hobbes: it touches ethical questions but occasionally and incidentally. It is a work of stupendous ei u- dition, of much more acuteness than at first appears, of frequent mastery over diction and illustration on subjects where it is most rare; and it is distinguished, perhaps beyond any other volume of controversy, by that best proof of the deepest conviction of the truth of a man s principles, a fearless statement of the most for¬ midable objections to them; a fairness rarely practised but by him who is conscious of his power to answer them. In all his writings, it must be owned, that his learning obscures his reasonings, and seems even to oppress his pow¬ erful intellect. It is an unfortunate effect of the redundant fulness of his mind, that it over¬ flows in endless digressions, which break the chain of argument, and turn aside the thoughts of the reader from the main object. He was edu¬ cated before usage had limited the naturaliza¬ tion of new words from the learned languages; before the failure of those great men, from Bacon to Milton, who laboured to follow a Latin order in their sentences,—and the success of those men of inferior powers, from Cowley to Addison, who were content with the order, as well as the words, of pure and elegant conversation,—had, as it were, by a double series of experiments, ascertained that the involutions and inversions of the ancient languages are seldom reconcil¬ able with the genius of ours; and, unless skil¬ fully, as well as sparingly introduced, are at variance with the natural beauties of our prose composition.

Large ethical works of this eminent writer are extant in manuscript in the British Museum.1 * 3 One posthumous volume on morals was published by Dr Chandler, bishop of Durham, entitled, A Treatise concerning Eter¬ nal and Immutable Morality. “ But there is the more reason to regret (as far as relates to the history of opinion) that the larger treatises are still unpublished, because the above volume is not so much an ethical treatise as an introduc¬ tion to one. Protagoras of old, and Hobbes then alive, having concluded that right and wrong were unreal, because they were not perceived by the senses, and because all human knowledge consists only in such perception, Cudworth en¬ deavours to refute them, by disproving that part of their premises which forms the last-stated proposition. The mind has many conceptions (vwj/xara) which are not cognizable by the senses; and though they are occasioned by sensible ob¬ jects, yet could not be formed but by a faculty superior to sense. The conceptions of justice and duty he places among them. The distinction of right from wrong is discerned by reason; and as soon as these words are defined, it be¬ comes evident that it would be a contradiction in terms to affirm that any power, human or divine, could change their nature; or, in other words, make the same act to be just and unjust at the same time. They had existed eternally, in the only mode in which truths can he said to be eternal, in the Eternal Mind; and they were indestructible and unchangeable like that Su¬ preme Intelligence.5 Whatever judgment may he formed of this reasoning, it is manifest that it relates merely to the philosophy of the understanding, and does not attempt any explanation of what constitutes the very essence of morality, its relation to the will. That we perceive a distinction between right and wrong as much as between a triangle and a square, is indeed true; and may possibly lead to an explanation of the reason why men should adhere to the one and avoid the other",Durham,US,8,United States,North America
"Though his life was devoted to the assertion of divine Providence, and though his philosophy was imbued with the religious spirit of Plato¬ nism, 4 yet he had placed Christianity too purely in the love of God and man to be considered as having much regard for those controversies about rites and opinions with which zealots disturb the world. They represented him as having fallen into the same heresy with Milton and with Clarke;5 and some of them even charged him with atheism, for no other reason than that he was not afraid to state the atheistic difficul¬ ties in their fullest force.

Roused by the preva¬ lence of the doctrines of Spinoza and Hobbes, he endeavoured to demonstrate the being and attri¬ butes of God, from a few axioms and definitions, in the manner of geometry; an attempt in which, with all his powers of argument, it must be owned that he is compelled sometimes tacitly to assume what the laws of reasoning required him to prove; and that, on the whole, his failure may be regarded as a proof that such a mode of argument is beyond the faculties of man.4 Justly considering the moral attributes of the Deity as what alone renders him the object of religion, and to us constitutes the difference be¬ tween theism and atheism, he laboured with the utmost zeal to place the distinctions of right and wrong on a more solid foundation ; and to explain the conformity of morality to reason, in a manner calculated to give a precise and scien¬ tific signification to that phraseology which all philosophers had, for so many ages, been content to employ, without thinking themselves obliged to define",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The knowledge of them is omniscience. These eternal different relations of things involve a consequent eternal fitness or unfitness in the ap¬ plication of things one to another; with a re¬ gard to which, the will of God always chooses, and which ought likewise to determine the wills of all subordinate rational beings. These eter¬ nal differences make it fit and reasonable for the creatures so to act; they cause it to be their duty, or lay an obligation on them so to do, se¬ parate from the will of God,1 * and antecedent to any prospect of advantage or reward.3 Nay, wilful wickedness is the same absurdity and insolence in morals, as it would he in natural things to pretend to alter the relations of num¬ bers, or to take away the properties of ma¬ thematical figures.3 “Morality,” says one of his most ingenious scholars, “ is the practice of reason.”4 Clarke, like Cudworth, considered such a scheme as the only security against Hobbism, and probably against the Calvinistic theology, from which they were almost as averse. Not content, with Cumberland, to attack Hobbes on ground which was in part his own, they thought it necessary to build on entirely new founda¬ tions. Clarke more especially, instead of sub¬ stituting social and generous feeling for the self¬ ish appetites, endeavoured to bestow on morality the highest dignity, by thus deriving it from reason. He made it more than disinterested ; for he placed its seat in a region where interest never enters, and passion never disturbs. By ranking her principles with the first truths of science, he seemed to render them pure and im¬ partial, infallible and unchangeable. It might be excusable to regret the failure of so noble an attempt, if the indulgence of such regrets did not betray an unworthy apprehension that the same excellent ends could only be attained by such frail means; and that the dictates of the most severe reason would not finally prove re¬ concilable with the majesty of virtue",Cumberland,US,8,United States,North America
"The adoption of mathematical forms and terms was, inEngland, a prevalent fashion among writers on moral subjects during a large part of the eighteenth century. The ambition of mathe¬ matical certainty, on matters concerning which it is not given to man to reach it, is a frailty from which the disciple of Newton ought in reason to have been withheld, but to which he was naturally tempted by the example of his master. Nothing but the extreme difficulty of detaching assent from forms of expression to which it has been long wedded, can explain the fact, that the incautious expressions above cited, into which Clarke was hurried by his moral sensibility, did not awaken him to a sense of the error into which he had fall en. As soon as he had said that “ a wicked act was as absurd as an attempt to take away the properties of a figure,” he ought to have seen, that principles which led logically to such a conclusion were untrue. As it is an impossibility to make three and three cease to be six, it ought, on his principles, to be impossible to do a wicked act. To act without regard to the relations of things, as if a man were to choose fire for cooling, or ice for heating, would be the part either of a lunatic or an idiot. The murderer who poisons by arsenic, acts agreeably to his knowledge of the power of that substance to kill, which is a relation between two things ; 1 “ Those who found all moral obligation on the will of God must recur to the same thing, only they do not explain how the nature and will of God is good and just.” (Being and Attributes of God, Proposition xii.) 1 Evidence of Natural and Revealed Religion, p. 4, 6th edit.

"As far as it is not presumptuous to attempt a distinction between modes of thinking foreign to the mind which makes the attempt, and modes of expression scarcely translatable into the only technical language in which that mind is wont to think, it seems that the systems of Cudworth and Clarke, though they appear very similar, are in reality different in some important points of view. The former, a Platonist, sets out from those Ideas, (a word, in this acceptation of it, which has no corresponding term in English) the eternal models of created things, which, as the Athenian master taught, pre-existed in the everlasting intellect, and, of right, rule the will of every inferior mind. The illustrious scholar of Newton, with a manner of thinking more natural to his age and school, considered pri¬ marily the very relations of things themselves ; conceived indeed by the Eternal Mind, but which, if such inadequate language maybe par¬ doned, are the law of its will, as well as the model of its works.1 EARL OF SHAFTESBURY.* Lord Shaftesbury, the author of the CAarac- vices, the bitter fruits of the insecurity of a teristics, was the grandson of Sir Antony Ashley troublous time, succeeded by the corrupting ha- Cooper, created Earl of Shaftesbury, one of bits of an inconstant, venal, and profligate court, the master spirits of the English nation, whose have led an ungrateful posterity to overlook his 1 Mr Wollaston’s system, that morality consisted in acting according to truth, seems to coincide with that of Dr Clarke","Newton, Cooper","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"

If the truth spoken of be, that gratitude is due for benefits, the reasoning is evidently a circle.

"For a time the work was admired more undis- tinguishingly than its literary character war¬ rants. In the succeeding period it was justly criticised, hut too severely condemned. Of late, more unjustly than in either of the former cases, it has been generally neglected. It seemed to have the power of changing the temper of its critics. It provoked the amiable Berkeley to a harshness equally unwonted and unwarranted;1 2 while it softened the rugged Warburton so far as to dispose the fierce yet not altogether un¬ generous polemic to praise an enemy in the very heat of conflict.8 Leibnitz, the most celebrated of Continental philosophers, warmly applauded the Character¬ istics, and, (what was a more certain proof of admiration) though at an advanced age, cri¬ ticised that work minutely.3 * * * * Le Cl ere, who had assisted the studies of the author, contri¬ buted to spread its reputation by his Journal, then the most popular in Europe. Locke is said to have aided in his education, probably rather by counsel than by tuition. The author had indeed been driven from the regular stu¬ dies of his country by the insults with which he was loaded at Winchester school, when he was only twelve years old, immediately after the death of his grandfather; a choice of time which seemed not so much to indicate anger against the faults of a great man, as triumph over the principles of liberty, which seemed at that time to have fallen for ever. He gave a gen¬ uine proof of respect for freedom of thought, by preventing the expulsion, from Holland, of Bayle, (with whom he differs in every moral, political, and, it may be truly added, religious opinion) when, it must be owned, the right of asylum was, in strict justice, forfeited by the se¬ cret services which the philosopher had rendered to the enemy of Holland and of Europe. In the small part of his short life which premature infirmities allowed him to apply to public affairs, he co-operated zealously with the friends of freedom; but, as became a moral philosopher, he supported, even against them, a law to allow those who were accused of treason to make their defence by counsel, although the parties first to benefit from this act of imperfect justice were conspirators to assassinate King William, and to re-enslave their country. On that occasion it is well known with what admirable quickness he took advantage of the embarrassment which seized him, when he rose to address the House of Commons. “ If I,” said he, “ who rise only to give my opinion on this bill, am so confound¬ ed that I cannot say what I intended, what must the condition of that man be, who, with¬ out assistance, is pleading for his own life !” He was the friend of Lord Somers; and the tribute paid to his personal character by Warburton, who knew many of his contemporaries and some of his friends, may be considered as evidence of its excellence","Of, Berkeley, Warburton, Winchester, Holland, Holland, Warburton","US,PK,TR",8,"United States,Pakistan,Turkey","North America,Asia,Asia"
"Lord Shaftesbury, instead of hiding himself be¬ hind his work, stands forward with too frequent marks of self-complacency, as a nobleman of polished manners, with a mind adorned by the 1 Berkeley’s Minute Philosopher, Dialogue iii.; but especially his Theory of Vision Vindicated, Loud. 1733, (not re¬ published in the quarto edition of his works) where this most excellent man sinks for a moment to the level of a railing polemic",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"Grace belongs only to natural movements; and Lord Shaftesbury, notwithstanding the frequent beauty of his thoughts and language, has rarely attained it. He is unfortunately prone to plea¬ santry, which is obstinately averse from con¬ straint, and which he had no interest in raising to be the test of truth. His affectation of liveliness as a man of the world, tempts him sometimes to overstep the indistinct boundaries which sepa¬ rate familiarity from vulgarity. Of his two more considerable writings, the Moralists, on which he evidently most valued himself, and which is spoken of by Leibnitz with enthusiasm, is by no means the happiest. Yet perhaps there is scarcely any composition in our language more lofty in its moral and religious sentiments, and more exquisitely elegant and musical in its diction, than the Platonic representation of the scale of beauty and love, in the speech to Palemon, near the close of the first part.1 * Many passages might be quoted, which in some measure justify the enthusiasm of the septuage¬ narian geometer. Yet it is not to be concealed that, as a whole, it is heavy and languid. It is a modern antique. The dialogues of Plato are often very lively representations of conversations which might take place daily at a great univer¬ sity, full, like Athens, of rival professors and eager disciples,—^between men of various character, and great fame as well as ability. Socrates runs through them all. His great abilities, his still more venerable virtues, his cruel fate, especially when joined to his very characteristic pecu¬ liarities,—to his grave humour, to his homely sense, to his assumed humility, to the honest sliness with which he ensnared the Sophists, and to the intrepidity with which he dragged them to justice, gave unity and dramatic inter¬ est to these dialogues as a whole. But Lord Shaftesbury’s dialogue is between fictitious per¬ sonages, and in a tone at utter variance with English conversation. He had great power of thought and command over words. But he had no talent for inventing character and bestowing life on it. The Inquiry concerning Virtue* is nearly exempt from the faulty peculiarities of the author; the method is perfect, the reasoning just, the style precise and clear. The writer has no purpose but that of honestly proving his prin¬ ciples; he himself altogether disappears; and he is intent only on earnestly enforcing what he truly, conscientiously, and reasonably believes","Of, Plato, Athens","TR,CO,US,UK",8,"Turkey,Colombia,United States,N/A","Asia,South America,North America,N/A"
"So Jeremy Taylor : “ He that is grown in grace pursues virtue purely and simply for its own interest. When persons come to that height of grace, and love God for himself, that is but heaven in another sense.” {Sermon on Growth in Grace.)

"Fenelon had been appointed tutor to the Duke of Burgundy. He had all the qualities which fit a man to be the preceptor of a prince, and -BOSSUET.* which most disable him to get or to keep the office. Even birth, and urbanity, and accom¬ plishment, and vivacity, were an insufficient atonement for his genius and virtue. Louis XIV. distrusted so fine a spirit, and appears to have early suspected, that a fancy moved by such benevolence might imagine examples for his grandson which the world would consider as a satire on his own reign. Madame de Main- tenon, indeed, favoured him; but he was gene¬ rally believed to have forfeited her good graces by discouraging her projects for at least a near¬ er approach to a seat on the throne. He offend¬ ed her by obeying her commands, in laying be¬ fore her an account of her faults, and some of those of her royal husband, which was probably the more painfully felt for its mildness, justice, and refined observation.5 An opportunity for driving such an intruder from a court presented itself somewhat strangely, in the form of a subtile controversy on one of the most abstruse ques¬ tions of metaphysical theology. Molinos, a Spa¬ nish priest, reviving and perhaps exaggerating the maxims of the ancient Mystics, had recently taught, that Christian perfection consisted in the pure love of God, without hope of reward or fear of punishment. This offence he expiated by seven years’ imprisonment in the dungeons of the Roman Inquisition. His opinions were em¬ braced by Madame Guyon, a pious French lady of strong feeling and active imagination, who appears to have expressed them in a hyperboli¬ cal language, not infrequent in devotional exer¬ cises, especially in those of otherwise amiable nature than a place, and heaven canrfot be so well defined by anything without us, as by something within us.” (Select Discourses, 2d edit. Cambridge, 1673.) v In accordance with these old authorities is the recent language of a most ingenious as well as benevolent and pious wri- ter. “ ihe holiness of heaven is still more attractive to the Christian than its happiness. The desire of doing that which is right for its own sake is a part of his desire after heaven.” (Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel, by T.

"She left her family, took a part in public con¬ ferences, and assumed an independence scarcely reconcilable with the more ordinary and more pleasing virtues of women. Her pious effusions were examined with the rigour which might he exercised on theological propositions. She was falsely charged by Harlay, the dissolute arch¬ bishop of Paris, with personal licentiousness",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"For these crimes she was dragged from convent to convent, imprisoned for years in the Bastile, and, as an act of mercy, confined during the lat¬ ter years of her life to a provincial town, as a prison at large. A piety thus pure and disin¬ terested could not fail to please Fenelon. He published a work in justification of Madame Guyon’s character, and in explanation of the degree in which he agreed with her. Bossuet, the oracle and champion of the church, took up arms against him. It would he painful to sup¬ pose that a man of so great powers was actuated by mean jealousy, and it is needless. The union of zeal for opinion with the pride of author¬ ity, is apt to give sternness to the administra¬ tion of controversial bishops; to say nothing of the haughty and inflexible character of Bossuet himself. He could not brook the independence of him who was hitherto so docile a scholar and so gentle a friend. He was jealous of novelties, and dreaded a fervour of piety likely to he un¬ governable, and perhaps to excite movements ot which no man could foresee the issue. It must be allowed that he had reason to he displeased with the indiscretion and turbulence of the in¬ novators, and might apprehend that, in preach¬ ing motives to virtue and religion which he thought, unattainable, the coarser hut surer foundations of common morality might be loosened. A controversy ensued, in which he employed the utmost violence of polemical or factious contest. Fenelon replied with brilliant guccess, and submitted his hook to the judg¬ ment of Rome. After a long examination, the commission of ten Cardinals appointed to ex¬ amine it were equally divided, and he seemed in consequence about to he acquitted. But Bossuet had in the mean time easily gained Louis XIV. Madame de Maintenon betrayed Fenelon’s confidential correspondence; and he was banished to his diocese, and deprived of his pensions and official apartments in the palace",Rome,US,8,United States,North America
"Louis XIV. regarded the slightest differences from the authorities of the French church as re¬ bellion against himself. Though endowed with much natural good sense, he was too grossly ignorant to be made to comprehend one of the terms of the question in dispute. He did not, however, scruple to urge the Pope to the con¬ demnation of Fenelon. Innocent XII. (Pigna- telli) an aged and pacific Pontiff, was desirous of avoiding such harsh measures. He said that “ the archbishop of Cambray might have erred from excess in the love of God, but the bishop of Meaux had sinned by a defect of the love of his neighbour.”1 But he was compelled to con¬ demn a series of propositions, of which the first was, “ there is an habitual state of love to God, which is pure from every motive of personal interest, and in which neither the fear of punish¬ ment nor the hope of reward has any part.”2 Fenelon read the bull which condemned him in his own cathedral, and professed as humble a submission as the lowest of his flock. In some of the writings of his advanced years, which have been recently published, we observe with regret that, when wearied out by his exile, ambitious to regain a place at court through the Jesuits, or prejudiced against the Calvinising doctrines of the Jansenists, the strongest anti-papal party among Catholics, or somewhat detached from a cause of which his great antagonist had been the victorious leader, he made concessions to the abso¬ lute monarchy of Rome, which did not become a luminary of the Galilean church.3 Bossuet, in his writings on this occasion, be¬ sides tradition and authorities, relied mainly on the supposed principle of philosophy, that man must desire his own happiness, and cannot de- 1 Bausset, Histoire de Fenelon, II. 220, note","Meaux, Rome","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"This defective and disorderly mode of publica¬ tion arose partly from the jars between business and study, inevitable in his course of life; but probably yet more from the nature of his system, which, while it widely deviates from the most general principles of former philosophers, is ready to embrace their particular doctrines under its own generalities, and thus to reconcile them to each other, as well as to accommodate itself to popular or established opinions, and compro¬ mise with them, according to his favourite and oft-repeated maxim, “ that most received doc¬ trines are capable of a good sense ;”3 by which last words our philosopher meant a sense reconcil¬ able with his own principles. Partial and oc¬ casional exhibitions of these principles suited better that constant negotiation with opinions, establishments, and prejudices, to which extreme generalities are well adapted, than a full and methodical statement of the whole at once. It is the lot of every philosopher who attempts to make his principles extremely flexible, that they become like those tools which bend so easily as to penetrate nothing. Yet his manner of publi¬ cation perhaps led him to those wide intuitions, as comprehensive as those of Bacon, of which he expressed the result as briefly and pithily as Hobbes. The fragment which contains his ethi¬ cal principles is the Preface to a collection of documents illustrative of international law, pub¬ lished at Hanover in 1693 ;4 to which he often referred as his standard afterwards, especially when he speaks of Lord Shaftesbury, or of the controversy between the two great theologi¬ ans of France. “ Right,” says he, “ is moral power; obligation moral necessity.

Buf- fier, the only Jesuit whose name has a place in the history of Abstract Philosophy, has no pecu¬ liar opinions which would have required any mention of him as a moralist, were it not for the just reputation of his treatise on First Truths, with which Dr Reid so remarkably, though un¬ aware of its existence, coincides, even in the misapplication of so practical a term as com¬ mon sense to denote the faculty which recog¬ nises the truth of First Principles.

"Though many of the dissenters had then begun to relinquish Calvinism, the uniform effect of that doctrine, in disposing its adherents to meta¬ physical speculation, long survived the opinions which caused it, and cannot be doubted to have influenced the mind of Butler. When a student at the academy of Gloucester, he wrote private letters to Hr Clarke on his celebrated Demonstra¬ tion, suggesting objections which were really in¬ superable, and which are marked by an acute¬ ness which neither himself nor any other ever surpassed. Clarke, whose heart was as well schooled as his head, published the letters, with his own answers, in the next edition of his work; and, by his good offices with his friend and follower, Sir Joseph Jekyll, obtained for the young philosopher an early opportunity of mak¬ ing his abilities and opinions known, by the ap¬ pointment of preacher at the Chapel of the Master of the Rolls.

It is an instance of the importance of style. No thinker so great was ever so bad a writer. Indeed, the ingenious apologies which have been lately attempted for this defect, amount to no more than that his power of thought was too much for his skill in language. How gene¬ ral must the reception have been of truths so cer¬ tain and momentous as those contained in But¬ ler’s Discourses,—with how much more clear ness must they have appeared to his own great understanding, if he had possessed the strength and distinctness with which Hobbes enforces odious falsehood, or the unspeakable charm of that transparent diction which clothed the un¬ fruitful paradoxes of Berkeley ! 364 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"HUTCHESON.* This ingenious writer began to try bis own strength by private Letters, written in his early youth to Dr Clarke, the metaphysical patriarch of his time; on whom young philosophers seem to have considered themselves as possessing a claim, which he had too much goodness to reject. His correspondence with Hutcheson is lost; but we may judge of its spirit by his answers to Butler, and by one to Mr Henry Home,1 2 * afterwards Lord Kames, then a young adventurer in the prevalent speculations. Nearly at the same period with Butler’s first publication,5 the writ¬ ings of Hutcheson began to show coincidences with him, indicative of the tendency of moral theory to a new form, to which an impulse had been given by Shaftesbury, and which was roused to activity by the adverse system of Clarke.

"Adverse factions and hostile wits concurred only in loving, admiring, and contributing to advance him. The severe sense of Swift endur¬ ed his visions; the modest Addison endeavour¬ ed to reconcile Clarke to his ambitious specula¬ tions. His character converted the satire of Pope into fervid praise. Even the discerning, fastidious, and turbulent Atterbury said, after an interview with him, “ So much understand¬ ing, so much knowledge, so much innocence, and such humility, I did not think had been the portion of any but angels, till I saw this gentle¬ man.”1 “ Lord Bathurst told me, that the Members of the Scriblerus Club being met at his house at dinner, they agreed to rally Berke¬ ley, who was also his guest, on his scheme at Bermudas. Berkeley, having listened to the many lively things they had to say, begged to be heard in his turn, and displayed his plan with such an astonishing and animating force of eloquence and enthusiasm, that they were struck dumb, and after some pause, rose all up together, with earnestness exclaiming, c Let us set out with him immediately.’”2 It was when thus beloved and celebrated that he conceived, at the age of forty-five, the design of devoting his life to reclaim and convert the natives of North America; and he employed as much influence and solicitation as common men do for their most prized objects, in obtaining leave to resign his dignities arid revenues, to quit his accom¬ plished and affectionate friends, and to bury himself in what must have seemed an intellec¬ tual desert.

"Thus disappointed in his ambition of keeping a School for Savage children, at a salary of a hun¬ dred pounds by the year, he was received, on his return, with open arms by the philosophical queen, at whose metaphysical parties he made one with Sherlock, who, as well as Smalridge, was his supporter, and with Hoadley, who, fol¬ lowing Clarke, was his antagonist. By her in¬ fluence, he was made bishop of Cloyne. It is one of his highest boasts, that though of Eng¬ lish extraction, he was a true Irishman, and the first eminent Protestant, after the unhappy contest at the Revolution, who avowed his love for all his countrymen. He asked, <{ Whether their habitations and furniture were not more sordid than those of the savage Americans?”3 “ Whether a scheme for the welfare of this nation should not take in the whole inhabitants ?” and, “ Whether it was a vain attempt^ to project the flourishing of our Protestant gentry^ exclusive of the bulk of the natives ?”4 He proceeds to pro¬ mote the reformation suggested in this pregnant question by a series of Queries, intimating, with the utmost skill and address, every reason that proves the necessity, and the safety, and the wisest mode of adopting his suggestion. He contributed, by a truly Christian address to the Roman Catholics of his diocese, to their perfect quiet during the rebellion of 1745; and soon after published a letter to the clergy of that per¬ suasion, beseeching them to inculcate indus¬ try among their flocks, for which he received their thanks. He tells them, that it was a say¬ ing among the negro slaves, “ if negro were not negro, Irishman would be negro.” It is difficult to read these proofs of benevolence and fore¬ sight without emotion, at the moment when,5 after a lapse of near a century, his suggestions have been at length, at the close of a struggle of twenty-five years, adopted, by the admis- * See his Querist, 358; published in 1735",Savage,US,8,United States,North America

The patriotism of Berkeley was not, like that of Swift, tainted by disappointed ambition; nor was it, like Swift’s, confined to a colony of English Pro¬ testants. Perhaps the Querist contains more hints, then original, still unapplied in legislation and political economy, than are to be found in any equal space. From the writings of his advanced years, when he chose a medical Tract1 * 3 to be the vehicle of his philosophical reflections, though it cannot be said that he relinquished his early opinions, it is at least apparent that his mind had received a new bent, and was habitually turned from reasoning towards con¬ templation. His immaterialism indeed modest¬ ly appears, but only to purify and elevate our thoughts, and to fix them on Mind, the para¬ mount and primeval principle of all things",Berkeley,"US,IE",8,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"
"He that would make a real progress in know¬ ledge, must dedicate his age as well as youth, the later growth as well as first fruits, at the altar of Truth.” So did Berkeley, and such were almost his latest words",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"His general principles of Ethics may be shortly stated in his own words :—“ As God is a being of infinite goodness, his end is the good of his creatures. The general wellbeing of all men of all nations, of all ages of the world, is that which he designs should be procured by the concur¬ ring actions of each individual.” Having stated that this end can be pursued only in one of two ways—either by computing the consequences of each action, or by obeying rules which generally tend to happiness—and having shown the first to be impossible, he rightly infers, “ that the end to which God requires the concurrence of human actions, must be carried on by the ob¬ servation of certain determinate and universal rules or moral precepts, which in their own na¬ ture have a necessary tendency to promote the wellbeing of mankind, taking in all nations and ages, from the beginning to the end of the world.”8 A romance, of which a journey to an Utopia, in the centre of Africa, forms the chief part, called The Adventures of Signor Gau- dentio di Lucca, has been commonly ascribed to him; probably on no other ground than its union of pleasing invention with benevolence and ele¬ gance.5 Of the exquisite grace and beauty of his diction, no man accustomed to English com¬ position can need to be informed. His works are, beyond dispute, the finest models of phi¬ losophical style since Cicero. Perhaps they surpass those of the orator, in the wonderful art by which the fullest light is thrown on the most minute and evanescent parts of the most subtile of human conceptions. Perhaps he also surpassed Cicero in the charm of sim¬ plicity, a quality eminently found in Irish wri¬ ters before the end of the eighteenth century; conspicuous in the masculine severity of Swift, 1 Siris, or Reflections on Tar Water","Lucca, Of, Cicero, Cicero","US,IT,TR,UK,IE",8,"United States,Italy,Turkey,N/A,Ireland","North America,Europe,Asia,N/A,Europe"
"in the Platonic fancy of Berkeley, in the native tenderness and elegance of Goldsmith, and not withholding its attractions from Hutcheson and Leland, writers of classical taste, though of inferior power. The two Irish philosophers of the eighteenth century may be said to have co-operated in calling forth the metaphysical genius of Scotland; for, though Hutcheson spread the taste, and furnished the principles, yet Berkeley undoubtedly produced the scep¬ ticism of Hume, which stimulated the instinc¬ tive school to activity, and was thought incap¬ able of confutation, otherwise than by their doctrines","Berkeley, Berkeley","US,IE",8,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"
"DAVID HUME.1 The Life of Mr Hume, written by himself, is remarkable above most, if not all writings of that sort, for hitting the degree of interest between coldness and egotism which becomes a modest man in speaking of his private history. Few writers, whose opinions were so obnoxious, have more perfectly escaped every personal imputa¬ tion. Very few men of so calm a character have been so warmly beloved. That he approached to the character of a perfectly good and wise man, is an affectionate exaggeration, for which his friend Dr Smith, in the first moments of his sorrow, may well he excused.2 * But such a praise can never be earned without passing through either of the extremes of fortune; with¬ out standing the test of temptations, dangers, and sacrifices. It may he said with truth, that the private character of Mr Hume exhibited all the virtues which a man of reputable station, under a mild government, in the quiet times of a civilized country, has often the opportunity to practise. He showed no want of the qualities which fit men for more severe trials. Though others had warmer affections, no man was a kinder relation, a more unwearied friend, or more free from meanness and malice. His cha¬ racter was so simple, that he did not even affect modesty; hut neither his friendships nor his de¬ portment were changed by a fame which filled all Europe. His good nature, his plain manners, and his active kindness, procured him at Paris the enviable name of the good David, from a society not so alive to goodness, as without reason to place it at the head of the qualities of a celebrated man.s His whole character is faith¬ fully and touchingly represented in the story of La Roche,4 where Mr Mackenzie, without con¬ cealing Mr HumeV opinions, brings him into contact with scenes of tender piety, and yet pre¬ serves the interest inspired by genuine and un¬ alloyed, though moderated feelings and affec¬ tions. The amiable and venerable patriarch of Scottish Literature was averse from the opinions of the philosopher on whom he has composed this best panegyric. He tells us that he read the manuscript to Dr Smith, “ who declared he did not find a syllable to object to, hut added, with his characteristic absence of mind, that he was surprised he had never heard of the anecdote be¬ fore.”5 So lively was the delineation thus sanc¬ tioned by the most natural of all testimonies","Paris, David","US,PA",8,"United States,Panama","North America,North America"
"“ It bears incontestable marks of a great capa¬ city, of a soaring genius, but young, and Rot yet thoroughly practised. Time and use may ripen these qualities in the author, and we shall probably have reason to consider this, com¬ pared with his later productions, in the same light as we view the juvenile works of Milton, or the first manner of Raphael.” The great speculator did not, in this work, amuse himself, like Bayle, with dialectical ex¬ ercises, which only inspire a disposition towards doubt, by showing in detail the uncertainty of most opinions. He aimed at proving, not that nothing was known, but that nothing could be known;—from the structure of the under¬ standing to demonstrate, that we are doomed for ever to dwell in absolute and universal ig¬ norance. It is true that such a system of uni¬ versal scepticism never can be more than an in¬ tellectual amusement, an exercise of subtilty; of which the only use is to check dogmatism, but which perhaps oftener provokes and pro¬ duces that much more common evil. As those dictates of experience which regulate conduct must be the objects of belief, all objections which attack them in common with the prin¬ ciples of reasoning must be utterly ineffectual",Milton,US,8,United States,North America
"That no dogmatist ever claimed more than the same degree of certainty for these various con¬ victions and opinions; and that his scepticism, therefore, leaves them in the relative condition in which it found them. No man knew better, or owned more frankly than Mr Hume, that to 1 Sextus, a physician of the empirical, i. e. anti-theoretical school, who lived at Alexandria in the reign of Antoninus f Pius, has preserved the reasonings of the ancient Sceptics as they were to be found in their most improved state, in the writings of /Enesidemus, a Cretan, who was a Professor in the same city, soon after the reduction of Egypt into a Homan province. The greater part of the grounds of doubt are very shallow and popular. There are, among them, intimations of the argument against a necessary connection of causes with effects, afterwards better presented by Glanville in his Scepsis Sdentifica. See Notes and Illustrations, note Q,",Alexandria,"EG,US",8,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"It is thus that Mr Hume’s theory of causation is used as an answer to arguments for the exist¬ ence of the Deity, without warning the reader that it would equally lead him not to expect that the sun will rise to-morrow. It must also he added, that those who are early accustomed to dispute first principles are never likely to acquire, in a sufficient degree, that earnestness and that sincerity, that strong love of truth, and that conscientious solicitude for the formation of just opinions, which are not the least virtues of men, hut of which the cultivation is the more especial duty of all who call themselves philo¬ sophers. 8 It is not an uninteresting fact, that Mr Hume having been introduced by Lord Kames (then Mr Henry Home) to Dr Butler, sent a copy of his Treatise to that philosopher at the moment of his preferment to the bishopric of Durham; and that the perusal of it did not deter the philosophic prelate from “ everywhere recom¬ mending Mr Hume’s Moral and Political Es¬ says,”1 * 3 published two years afterwards;—Essays which it would indeed have been unworthy of such a man not to have liberally commended, for they, and those which followed them, what¬ ever may he thought of the contents of some of them, must be ever regarded as the best models in any language, of the short hut full, of the clear and agreeable, though deep discussion of difficult questions",Durham,US,8,United States,North America
"Mr Hume considered his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals as the best of his wri¬ tings. It is very creditable to his character, that he should have looked hack with most complacency on a Tract the least distinguished by originality, and the least tainted with para¬ dox, among his philosophical works; hut deserv¬ ing of all commendation for the elegant perspi¬ cuity of the style, and the novelty of illustration and inference with which he unfolded to general readers a doctrine too simple, too certain, and too important, to remain till his time undis¬ covered among philosophers. His diction has, indeed, neither the grace of Berkeley nor the strength of Hobbes; hut it is without the verbo¬ sity of the former, or the rugged sternness of the latter. His manner is more lively, more easy, more ingratiating, and, if the word may 1 This maxim, which contains a sufficient answer to all universal scepticism, or, in other words, to all scepticism properly so called, is significantly conveyed in the quaint title of an old and rare book, entitled, Sciti, sivc Sceptices et Scepticorum a Jure Disputationis Exclusio, by Thomas White, the metaphysician of the English Catholics in modern times—“Fortu¬ nately,” says the illustrious sceptic himself, “ since Reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds. Nature herself suffices for that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical delirium"" (Treatise of Human Nature, I. 467); almost in the sublime and immor¬ tal words of Pascal: La Raison confond les Dogmatistes, et la Nature les Sceptiques",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"3 “ Si nobis, cum ex hac vita migraverimus, in beatorum insulis, ut fabulae ferunt, immortale sevum degere liceret, quid opus esset eloquentia, cum judicia nulla fierent ? aut ipsis etiam virtutibus ? Nec enim fortitudine indigeremus, nullo pro- posito aut laboreaut periculo; nec justitia, cum esset nihil quod appeteretur alieni; nec temperantia, quae regeret eas quae nullae essent libidines: ne prudentia quidem egeremus, nullo proposito delectu bonorum et malorum. Una igitur essemus beati cogmtioneyerum et scientia.” (Cicero. Fragm. ap. Augustin, de Trinit. iv. 2.) Cicero is more extensive, and therefore more consistent, than Hume ; but his enumeration errs both by excess and defect. He supposes knowledge to render beings happy in this imaginary state, without stooping to inquire how. He omits a virtue which might well exist in it, though we cannot conceive its formation in such a state—the delight in each other’s wellbeing ; and he omits a conceivable though unknown vice, that of unmixed ill-will, which would render such a state a hell to the wretch who harboured the malevolence","Una, Cicero, Cicero","US,IN",8,"United States,India","North America,Asia"
"That general utility constitutes a uniform ground of moral distinctions, is a part of Mr Hume’s ethical theory which never can be im¬ pugned, until some example can be produced of a virtue generally pernicious, or of a vice gene¬ rally beneficial. The religious philosopher who, with Butler, holds that benevolence must be the actuating principle of the Divine mind, will, with Berkeley, maintain that pure benevolence can prescribe no rules of human conduct but such as are beneficial to men; thus bestowing on the theory of Moral Distinctions the certainty of demonstration in the eyes of all who believe in God",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"  Tenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen Qui primus potuisti, inlustrans commoda vit^e, Te sequor! (Lucret. lib. iii.) In a science more difficult, because both ascend¬ ing to more simple general principles, and run¬ ning down through more minute applications, though the success of Smith has been less com¬ plete, his genius is not less conspicuous. Per¬ haps there is no ethical work since Cicero’s Of¬ fices, of which an abridgement enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the Theory of Moral Sentiments. This is not chiefly owing to the beauty of diction, as in the case of Cicero; but to the variety of explanations of life and manners which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, on the other hand, it must be owned that, for pure¬ ly philosophical purposes, few hooks more need abridgement: for the most careful reader fre¬ quently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations. The naturally copious and flow¬ ing style of the author is generally redundant, and the repetition of certain formularies of the system is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous. Per¬ haps Smith and Hobbes may be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our philosophy; the first of graceful fulness falling •into flaccidity; while the masterly concision of the second is oftener tainted by dictatorial dry¬ ness. Hume and Berkeley, though they are nearer the extreme of abundance,5 are probably the least distant from perfection","Cicero, Of, Cicero, Berkeley","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"379 Hartley and Condillac,1 who, much about the same time, hut seemingly without any know¬ ledge of each other’s speculations,2 * began in a very similar mode to simplify, hut also to muti¬ late the system of Locke, stopped short of what is called Materialism, which consummates the confusion, hut touched its threshold. Thither, it must be owned, their philosophy pointed, and thither their followers proceeded. Hartley and Bonnet,5 still more than Condillac, suffered them¬ selves, like most of their contemporaries, to overlook the important truth, that all the changes in the organs which can he likened to other material phenomena, are nothing more than an¬ tecedents and prerequisites of perception, hearing not the faintest likeness to it; as much outward in relation to the thinking principle, as if they occurred in any other part of matter; and of which the entire comprehension, if it were at¬ tained, would not bring us a step nearer to the nature of thought. They who would have been the first to exclaim against the mistake of a sound for a colour, fell into the more unspeak¬ able error of confounding the perception of ob¬ jects, as outward, with the consciousness of our own mental operations. Locke’s doctrine, that Reflection was a separate source of ideas, left room for this greatest of all distinctions,— though with much unhappiness of expression, and with no little variance from the course of his own speculations. Hartley, Condillac, and Bonnet, in hewing away this seeming deformity from the system of their master, unwittingly struck off the part of the building which, how¬ ever unsightly, gave it the power of yielding some shelter and guard to truths, of which the exclusion rendered it utterly untenable. They became consistent Nominalists; a controversy on which Locke expresses himself with confu¬ sion and contradiction; but on this subject they added nothing to what had been taught by Hobbes and Berkeley. Both Hartley and Con¬ dillac4 have the merit of having been unseduced by the temptations either of scepticism or of useless idealism; which, even if Berkeley and Hume could have been unknown to them, must have been within sight. Both agree in referring all the intellectual operations to the association of ideas, and in representing that association as reducible to the single law, that ideas which en¬ ter the mind at the same time, acquire a ten¬ dency to call up each other, which is in direct proportion to the frequency of their having en¬ tered together. In this important part of their doctrine they seem, whether unconsciously or otherwise, to have only repeated, and very much expanded, the opinion of Hobbes.5 In its sim¬ plicity it is more agreeable than the system of Mr Hume, who admitted five independent laws of association; and it is in comprehension far superior to the views of the same subject by Mr Locke, whose ill-chosen name still retains its place in our nomenclature, but who only appeals to the principle as explaining some fancies and whimsies of the human mind. The capital fault of Hartley is that of a rash generalization, which may prove imperfect, and which is at least pre¬ mature. All attempts to explain instinct by this principle have hitherto been unavailing. Many of the most important processes of reasoning have not hitherto been accounted for by it.6 It would appear by a close examination, that even this theory, simple as it appears, presupposes many facts relating to the mind, of which its authors 1 Born in 1715 ; died in 1780","Berkeley, Berkeley, Born","US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"4 The following note of Condillac will show how much he differed from Hartley in his mode of considering the Newton¬ ian hypothesis of vibrations, and how far he was in that respect superior to him. “ Je suppose ici et ailleurs que les per¬ ceptions de Tame ont pour cause physique I’ebranlement des fibres du cerveau; non que je regarde cette hypothese comme de- montrte, maxs parcequ' elle est la plus commode pour expliquer ma pcnsee.” {CEuvres de Condillac, I. 60.

"To the ingenuous, humble, and anxiously con¬ scientious character of Hartley, we owe the know¬ ledge that, about the year 1730, he was inform¬ ed that the Rev. Mr Gay of Sidney College, Cambridge, then living in the west of England, asserted the possibility of deducing all our intel¬ lectual pleasures and pains from association; that this led him (Hartley) to consider the power of association; and that about that time Mr Gay published his sentiments on this matter in a dis¬ sertation prefixed to Bishop Law’s Translation of King’s Origin of Evil.* No writer deserves more the praise of abundant fairness than Hartley in this avowal. The dissertation of which he speaks is mentioned by no philosopher but himself. It suggested nothing apparently to any other read¬ er. The general texture of it is that of home- spun selfishness. The writer had the merit to see and to own that Hutcheson had established as a fact the reality of moral sentiments and dis¬ interested affections. He blames, perhaps just¬ ly, that most ingenious man,5 for assuming that these sentiments and affections are implanted, and partake of the nature of instincts. The ob¬ ject of his dissertation is to reconcile the mental appearances described by Hutcheson with the 1 See Notes and Illustrations, note U",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"5 It has not been mentioned in its proper place, that Hutcheson appears nowhere to greater advantage than in Letters on the Fable of the Bees, published when he was very young, at Dublin, in a publication called Hibernicus. “ Private vices public benefits,” says he, “ may signify any one of these five distinct propositions : 1. They are in themselves public be¬ nefits ; or, 2. They naturally produce public happiness ; or, 3. They may be made to produce it; or, 4, They may natu¬ rally flow from it; or, 5. At least they may probably flow from it in our infirm nature.” (See a small volume containing Thoughts on Laughter, and Observations on the Fable of the Bees, Glasgow, 1758, in which these letters are republished.)

"It is in mixed, not in pure philosophy, that his superiority consists. In the part of his work which relates to the intellect, he has adopted much from Hartley, hiding but ag¬ gravating the offence by a change of technical terms; and he was ungrateful enough to coun¬ tenance the vulgar sneer which involves the mental analysis of that philosopher in the ridi¬ cule to which his physiological hypothesis is liable.3 Thus, for the Hartleian term Associa¬ tion he substitutes that of Translation, when he adopts the same theory of the principles which move the mind to action. In the practical and applicable part of that inquiry he indeed far surpasses Hartley; and it is little to add, that he unspeakably exceeds that bare and naked thinker in the useful as well as admirable facul¬ ty of illustration. In the strictly theoretical 1 This disposition to compromise and accommodation, which is discoverable in Paley, was carried to its utmost length by Mr Hey, a man of much acuteness, Professor of Divinity at Cambridge",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"2 Perhaps no philosopher ever stated more justly, more naturally, or more modestly than Tucker, the ruling maxim of his life. “ My thoughts,” says he, “ have taken a turn from my earliest youth towards searching into the foundations and measures of right and wrong; my love for retirement has furnished me with continual leisure; and the exercise of my reason has been my daily employment.” 3 Light of Nature, I. c. xviii. of which the conclusion may be pointed out as a specimen of perhaps unmatched fruitfulness, vivacity, and felicity of illustration.

"tions by which he was seduced would leave only one appetite or desire in human nature. He had no adequate and constant conception, that the translation of Desire from the end to the means occasioned the formation of a new passion, which is perfectly distinct from, and altogether independent of, the original desire. Too fre¬ quently (for he was neither obstinate nor uni¬ form in error) he considered these translations as accidental defects in human nature, not as the appointed means of supplying it with its variety of active principles. He was too apt to speak as if the selfish elements were not de¬ stroyed in the new combination, but remain¬ ed still capable of being recalled, when conve¬ nient, like the links in a chain of reasoning, which we pass over from forgetfulness, or for brevity. Take him all in all, however, the neglect of his writings is the strongest proof of the disinclination of the English nation, for the last half century, to Metaphysical Phi¬ losophy. 1 WILLIAM PALEY.2 This excellent writer, who, after Clarke and Butler, ought to be ranked among the brightest ornaments of the English church in the eigh¬ teenth century, is, in the history of philosophy, naturally placed after Tucker, to whom, with praiseworthy liberality, he owns his extensive obligations. It is a mistake to suppose that he owed his system to Hume, a thinker too refined, and a writer perhaps too elegant, to have natu¬ rally attracted him. A coincidence in the prin¬ ciple of utility, common to both with so many other philosophers, affords no sufficient ground for the supposition. Had he been habitually in¬ fluenced by Mr Hume, who has translated so many of the dark and crabbed passages of But¬ ler into his own transparent as well as beautiful language, it is not possible to suppose that such a mind as that of Paley should have fallen into those principles of gross selfishness of which Mr Hume is a uniform and zealous antagonist",Tucker,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"
"The natural frame of Paley’s understanding fitted it more for business and the world than for philosophy; and he accordingly enjoyed with considerable relish the few opportunities which the latter part of his life afforded of tak¬ ing a part in the affairs of his county as a ma¬ gistrate. Penetration and shrewdness, firm¬ ness and coolness, a vein of pleasantry, fruitful though somewhat unrefined, with an original homeliness and significancy of expression, were 1 Much of Tucker’s chapter on Pleasure, and of Paley’s on Happiness (both of which are invaluable), is contained in the passage of The Traveller, of which the following couplet expresses the main object: “ Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy, “ To fill the languid pause with finer joy.” . . „ “ An honest man,” says Mr Hume, “ has the frequent satisfaction of seeing knaves betrayed by their own maxims","Much, Tucker","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"

"Two years after, he published a most excellent tract on The Hard Labour Bill, which, concur¬ ring with the spirit excited by Howard’s inqui¬ ries, laid the foundation of just reasoning on Re¬ formatory Punishment. The Letters on Usury' are perhaps the best specimen of the exhaustive discussion of a moral or political question, leav¬ ing no objection, however feeble, unanswered, and no difficulty, however small, unexplained; remarkable also for the clearness and spirit of the style, for the full exposition which suits them to all intelligent readers, for the tender and skilful hand with which prejudice is touched, and for the urbanity of his admirable apology for projectors, addressed to Dr Smith, whose temper and manner he seems for a time to have imbibed.

What heart does not warm at the noble exclamation of the ancient poet: <c Who is pleased by false honour, or frightened by lying infamy, but he who is false and depraved!” Every uncorrupted mind feels unmerited praise as a bitter reproach, and regards a consciousness of demerit as a drop ot poison in the cup of honour. How different is the applause which truly delights us all, a proof that the consciences of others are in har¬ mony with our own ! “ What,” says Cicero, “ is glory hut the concurring praise of the good, the unhought approbation of those who judge aright of excellent virtue !” A far greater than Cicero rises from the purest praise of man, to more sublime contemplations","Cicero, Cicero",US,8,United States,North America

The same sort of observation is much more strongly applicable to habitual dispositions, which, if they he spoiled, we have no certain means of repla¬ cing or mending.

"Dugatd Stewart was the son of Dr Matthew Stewart, Professor of Mathematics in the Uni¬ versity of Edinburgh; a station immediately before filled by Maclaurin, on the recommenda¬ tion of Newton. Hence the poet spoke of “ the philosophic sire and son.”8 He was educated at Edinburgh, and he heard the lectures of Reid at Glasgow. He was early associated with his father in the duties of the Mathematical Profes¬ sorship ; and during the absence of Dr Adam Ferguson as Secretary to the Commissioners sent to conclude a peace with North America, he occupied the chair of Moral Philosophy. He uncouthness a philosophy which he understood and admired. As he wrote in a general lan¬ guage, he propagated its doctrines throughout Europe, where they were beneficial to jurispru¬ dence, hut perhaps injurious to the cause of re¬ formation in government. That they became more popular abroad than at home, is partly to be ascribed to the taste and skill of M. Dumont; partly to that tendency towards free specula¬ tion and bold reform which was more prevalent among nations newly freed, or impatiently aspir¬ ing to freedom, than in a people long satisfied with the possession of a system of government like that which others were struggling to ob¬ tain, and not yet aware of the imperfections and abuses in their laws, to the amendment of which a cautious consideration of Mr Bentham’s works will undoubtedly most materially con¬ tribute","Edinburgh, Newton, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ferguson, Dumont","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

"This office, filled in immediate succession by Ferguson, Stewart, and Brown, received a lustre from their names, which it owed in no degree to its modest exterior or its limited ad¬ vantages ; and was rendered by them the highest dignity, in the humble, but not obscure, esta¬ blishments of Scottish literature. The lectures of Mr Stewart, for a quarter of a century, render¬ ed it famous through every country where the light of reason was allowed to penetrate. Per¬ haps few men ever lived, who poured into the breasts of youth a more fervid and yet reason¬ able love of liberty, of truth, and of virtue",Ferguson,US,8,United States,North America
"His observations on suggestion, on natural signs, on the connection between what he calls sensa¬ tion and perception, though perhaps occasioned by Berkeley, whose idealism Reid had once adopted, are marked by the genuine spirit of original observation. As there are too many who seem more wise than they are, so it was the more uncommon fault of Reid to appear less a philosopher than he really was. Indeed his temporary adoption of Berkeleianism is a proof of an unprejudiced and acute mind. Perhaps no man ever rose finally above the seductions of that simple and ingenious system, who had not sometimes tried their full effect by surrendering his whole mind to them",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America
"But it is never with entire impunity that philosophers borrow vague and inappropriate terms from vulgar use.

"Long after the death of Dr Reid, his philoso¬ phy was taught at Paris by M. Royer Collard,1 who, on the restoration of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his nation, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His inge¬ nious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls <c the sage and timid” doctrines of Edinburgh, which he con¬ sidered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of “ such a masculine and brilliant character as might command the attention of Europe, and be able to struggle with success on a great theatre, against the genius of the adverse school.”* It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense nomen¬ clature, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The prefer¬ ence of the more boastful system, over a philo¬ sophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest preten¬ sions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its in¬ fluence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many supporters : and, in¬ deed, the accomplished Professor himself rapid¬ ly shot through Kantianism, and now appears to rest or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to descry from it any distinction between objects, —even that indispensable distinction between Reality and Illusion.

"He reminds us not unfrequently of the cha¬ racter given by Cicero to one of his contempo¬ raries, “ who expressed refined and abstruse thought in soft and transparent diction.” His writings are a proof that the mild sentiments have their eloquence as well as the vehement passions. It would be difficult to name works in which so much refined philosophy is joined with so fine a fancy,—so much elegant litera¬ ture, with such a delicate perception of the distinguishing excellencies of great writers, and with an estimate in general so just of the ser¬ vices rendered to knowledge by a succession of philosophers. They are pervaded by a philoso¬ phical benevolence, which keeps up the ardour of his genius, without disturbing the serenity of his mind,—which is felt in his reverence for knowledge, in the generosity of his praise, and in the tenderness of his censure. It is still more sensible in the general tone with which he re¬ lates the successful progress of the human un¬ derstanding, among many formidable enemies",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"Hence perhaps the unwonted severity of his lan¬ guage towards Tucker and Hartley. It is thus at the very time when he largely adopts the Principle of Association in his excellent Essay on the Beautiful,1 that he treats most rigidly the latter of these writers, to whom, though nei¬ ther the discoverer nor the sole advocate of that principle, it surely owes the greatest illustration and support",Tucker,US,8,United States,North America
"In matters of far other importance, causes perhaps somewhat similar may have led to the like mistake. When he absolutely contra¬ dicts Dr Reid, by truly stating that “ it is more philosophical to resolve the power of habit into the association of ideas, than to re¬ solve the association of ideas into habit,”2 * he, in the sequel of the same volume,5 refuses to go farther than to own, that “ the theory of Hart¬ ley concerning the origin of our affections, and of the moral sense, is a most ingenious refinement on the selfish system, and that by means of it the force of many of the common reasonings against that system is eluded;” though he somewhat inconsistently allows, that <c active principles which, arising from circumstances in which all the situations of mankind must agree, are there¬ fore common to the whole species, at whatever period of life they may appear, are to be regard¬ ed as a part of human nature, no less than the instinct of suction; in the same manner as the acquired perception of distance, by the eye, is to be ranked among the perceptive powers of man, no less than the original perceptions of the other senses.”4 In another place also he makes a remark on mere beauty, which might have led him to a more just conclusion respecting the the¬ ory of the origin of the affections and the moral sense: “ It is scarcely necessary forme to observe, that, in those instances where association operates in heightening (or he might have said creates) the pleasures we receive from sight, the pleasing emo¬ tion continues still to appear, to our conscious¬ ness, simple and uncompounded.”* To this re¬ mark he might have added, that until all the separate pleasures he melted into one,—as long as any of them are discerned and felt as distinct from each other,—the associations are incom¬ plete, and the qualities which gratify are not called by the name of beauty. In like manner, as has been repeatedly observed, it is only when all the separate feelings, pleasurable and pain¬ ful, excited by the contemplation of voluntary action, are lost in the general sentiments of ap- 1 Stewart’s Philosophical Essays, part ii. essay i. especially chap. vi.

"A delicate state of health, and an ardent de¬ sire to devote himself exclusively to study and composition, induced Mr Stewart, while in the full blaze of his reputation as a lecturer, to re¬ tire, in 1810, from the labour of public instruc¬ tion. This retirement, as he himself describes it, was that of a quiet but active life. Three quarto and two octavo volumes, besides the magnificent Dissertations prefixed to this En¬ cyclopaedia, were among its happy fruits. These Dissertations are, perhaps, the most profusely ornamented of any of his compositions ; a pecu¬ liarity which must in part have arisen from a principle of taste, which regarded decoration as more suitable to the history of philosophy than to philosophy itself.

Mr Erskine, who thus appears at the head of so remarkable an association, and whom diffidence and untoward circumstances have hitherto withheld from the full manifestation of his powers, conti¬ nued to be the bosom friend of Brown to the last, and showed the constancy of his friendship for others by converting all his invaluable preparations for a translation of Sultan Baber’s Commentaries (perhaps the best, certainly the most European work of modern eastern prose) into the means of completing the imperfect attempt of Leyden ; with a regard equally ge¬ nerous to the fame of his early friend, and to the comfort of that friend’s surviving relations. The review of Baber’s Com~ mentaries, by M. Silvestre de Sacy, in the Journal des Savans for May and June 1829, is perhaps one of the best specimens ex¬ tant of the value of literary commendation when it is bestowed with conscientious calmness, and without a suspicion of bias, by one of the greatest orientalists, in a case where he pronounces every thing to have been done by Mr Erskine “ which could have been performed by the most learned and the most scrupulously conscientious of editors and translators.” 412 preliminary dissertations",Seymour,US,8,United States,North America

It is darkened by excessive brightness ; it loses ease and liveliness by over-dress; and, in the midst of its luscious sweetness, we wish for the strik¬ ing and homely illustrations of Tucker, and for the pithy and sinewy sense of Paley, either of whom, by a single short metaphor from a fami¬ liar, perhaps a low object, could at one blow set the two worlds of reason and fancy in move¬ ment",Tucker,US,8,United States,North America
"There are two very different sorts of passages of poetry to be found in works on philosophy, which are as far asunder from each other in value as in matter. A philosopher will admit some of those wonderful lines or words which bring to light the infinite varieties of character, the furious bursts or wily workings of passion, the winding approaches of temptation, the slip¬ pery path to depravity, the beauty of tender¬ ness, the grandeur of what is awful and holy in man. In every such quotation, the moral phi¬ losopher, if he be successful, uses the best mate¬ rials of his science; for what are they hut the results of experiment and observation on the hu¬ man heart, performed by artists of far other skill and power than his ? They are facts which could have only been ascertained by Homer, by Dante, by Shakspeare, by Cervantes, by Milton. Every year of admiration since the unknown period when the Iliad first gave delight, has extorted new proofs of the justness of the picture of hu¬ man nature, from the responding hearts of the admirers. Every strong feeling which these masters have excited is a successful repetition of their original experiment, and a continually growing evidence of the greatness of their dis¬ coveries.

"In the application of these canons to the theory which derives most of the principles of human action from the transfer of a small num¬ ber of pleasures, perhaps organic, by the law of association to a vast variety of new objects, it cannot he denied, 1st, That it satisfies the first of the above conditions, inasmuch as association is really one of the laws of human nature; 2dly, That it also satisfies the second, for association certainly produces effects like those which are referred to it by this theory, otherwise there would be no secondary desires, no acquired re¬ lishes and dislikes;—facts universally acknow¬ ledged, which are and can he explained only by the principle called by Hobbes mental discourse; —by Locke, Hume, Hartley, Condillac, and the majority of speculators, as well as in common speech, association;—by Tucker, translation ;— and by Brown, suggestion. The facts generally referred to the principle resemble those which are claimed for it by the theory in this important particular, that in both cases equally, pleasure becomes attached to perfectly new things, so that the derivative desires become perfectly in¬ dependent on the primary.

"Some attempt has now been made to develope the fundamental principles of ethical theory, in that historical order in which meditation and discussion brought them successively into a clearer light. That attempt, as far as it re¬ gards Great Britain, is at least chronologically complete. The spirit of bold speculation, con¬ spicuous among the English of the seventeenth century, languished after the earlier part of the eighteenth, and seems, from the time of Hutcheson, to have passed into Scotland, where it produced Hume, the greatest of sceptics, and Smith, the most eloquent of modern mo¬ ralists; besides giving rise to that sober, mo¬ dest, perhaps timid Philosophy, which is com¬ monly called Scotch,—which has the singular merit of having first strongly and largely in¬ culcated the absolute necessity of admitting certain principles as the foundation of all rea¬ soning, and as being the indispensable con¬ ditions of thought itself. In the eye of the moralist, all the philosophers of Scotland, Hume and Smith as much as Reid, Campbell, and Stewart, have also the merit of having avoid¬ ed the selfish system; and of having, under whatever variety of representation, alike main¬ tained the disinterested nature of the social af¬ fections and the supreme authority of the moral sentiments. Brown reared the standard of re¬ volt against the masters of the Scottish School, and in reality, still more than in words, adopt¬ ed those very doctrines against which his pre¬ decessors, after their war against scepticism, uniformly combated. The law of association, though expressed in other language, became the nearly universal principle of his system; and perhaps it would have been absolutely universal if he had not been restrained rather by respectful feelings than by cogent reasons",Campbell,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"

"All men long concluded falsely, from what they saw, that the earth was stationary, and the sun in perpetual motion around it. The greater part of mankind still adopt the same error.

Nor is this all: The language which represents various states of mind is very vague.

"but, for the most part, they had some tradition about the birth oi each of them. Indeed, several of them were confessedly dead men, whom they imagined to have been raised to the ranks of the gods by their great deeds on earth. Thus Romu¬ lus, the founder of Rome, was worshipped by the Romans under the title of Quirinus. And Her¬ cules, and many others, worshipped by the ancient Pagans, were deified men, supposed to have gained immortality, by their eminent virtues, and espe¬ cially by their feats of war",Rome,US,8,United States,North America
"This is certain, that several savage tribes at this day profess to believe in a good god, and an evil one ; and address all their worship, and offer their sacrifices to the evil one. They sup¬ pose that the Good Being will, of his own accord, without being asked, do all the good in his power; and all their prayers and offerings are to the Evil one—or to several evil Beings—whose malice they hope to soften.3 The images and pictures of the gods of the ancient Egyptians, and of the Hindoos at this day, are usually strange monstrous figures, half man and half brute. And such was the Philis¬ tine image of Hagon, which was half man and half fish.4 The Greeks and Romans, on the con¬ trary, represented the greater part of their deities as handsome men and women ; but the image of Pan and some others were exceptions. And the emblem5 of Diana at Ephesus, which they wor¬ shipped as having “ fallen down from Jupiter,” is said to have been a rude, shapeless stone. It was most likely an aerolite—one of those stones which do really sometimes fall from the sky.

"3 We have an amusing instance of this tendency of the human mind in the anecdote (a true one), of the schoolboy w o was observed to bow in church whenever the name of Satan was mentioned; and being asked the reason, replied, “ I was afraid he might do me some harm.” 4 The name does actually signify a fish. _ 6 In our version (Acts xix.), it is called “ the image which fell down from Jupiter,” but the word “ image” is supplied y the translators ; the original merely speaks of their being worshippers, tou Atomrovs, of “ that which fell down from Jupiter","Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"As for the kind of worship which the Pagans paid to their gods, it was very much what might have been expected, considering what kind of Beings these gods were, according to their own accounts of them. When Moses is cautioning the Israelites against being led away by the ex¬ ample of their idolatrous neighbours, he says, “ Every abomination unto the Lord, which he hateth, have these nations done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters, have they burned in the fire unto their gods.” And the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, at this day, offer human victims to their gods; as did also the people of Mexico. The grossest profligacy, and the most atrocious cruelties, were not only not forbidden by the Pagan religions, but were even a part of their religious worship ; especially at the festivals of Bacchus",,MX,8,Mexico,North America
"It is not necessary for the present purpose to contend that what has been just said constitutes a rule without exception ; let it be admitted only as applying to the generality, or even to a considerable portion merely, of mankind (and thus far, at least, we are surely borne out, both by reason and experience) ; and let any one, with these principles before him, contemplate the picture drawn of the pestilence which ravaged Athens during the Peloponnesian war, by that judicious historian who was an eye-witness, and a partaker of the calamity. Whether the ancient poets or philosophers be regarded as the better in¬ structors in the doctrine of a future state, Athens had no deficiency in either ; and a plague so wide- spreading, so irresistible, and which brought with it to those whom it seized (as we are expressly told), such an utter despair of recovery, may be fairly expected to have had the effect, in some minds at least, of awakening whatever belief, or even suspicion, they might have entertained re¬ specting Tartarus and Elysium, and of calling into action their fears and hopes on the subject",Athens,US,8,United States,North America
"And accordingly, it appears that the great plague which desolated London, produced, on the whole, an effect exactly opposite to that at Athens","London, Athens","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"And that the prevailing belief, at other times, and in other states, Greek or Italian, was the same as at Athens at the period just spoken of, there is at least a strong presumption till evidence 1 Thucyd., lib. ii., c. 35, et seq",Athens,"US,GR,IT",8,"United States,Greece,Italy","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Cicero acknowledges that the epistle of Sul- picius to him on the death of Tullia, compre¬ hended every argument for comfort which the case admitted ; yet we find in it no allusion to the one topic which would have been uppermost in the mind of a believer. It is no wonder, therefore, that when at Athens, Paul came to speak of the resurrection of the dead, some of his hearers mocked; and that when Festus heard him declaring the same doctrine, he exclaimed, “ Paul, thou art beside thyself.” So far, indeed, were the promulgators of Chris¬ tianity from finding the belief of a future state al¬ ready well established, that they appear to have had no small difficulty in convincing of this truth even some of their converts. Some of those who denied a resurrection, may, indeed, with good reason, be supposed to have looked for some other kind of future existence; but when Paul finds it necessary to urge “ if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable —let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,”2 it is plain he must have been opposing such as expected nothing beyond the grave. And when he exhorts the Thessalonians not to sorrow for the deceased, “ even as the restz (of mankind), who have no hope” we have the testimony, if we will receive it, of one who knew better than we can, the real sentiments of the heathen on this point","Cicero, Athens",US,8,United States,North America
"463 that, as Dr Paley remarks, they did not, properly speaking, effect a discovery ; “ it was only one guess among many: he only discovers who provesbut also, that (as has been said above) their arguments did not fully succeed in convin¬ cing even themselves. Those which at one time they bring forward as decisive proof, they seem, at another time, to regard as hardly possessing that degree of probability, which, now that the doctrine is established, most are ready to allow them. Cicero, especially, who is frequently ap¬ pealed to on this question, we find distinctly ac¬ knowledging, at least in the person of one of his disputants, that though, while he is reading the Phaedo, he feels disposed to assent to the rea¬ sons urged in favour of a future state, his con¬ viction vanishes as soon as he lays down the book, and revolves the matter in his own thoughts; which was the feeling probably with which the author himself had written it. Many, indeed, of the deistical writers of modern times have come to much more decisive conclusions on this, and also on many other points, than the ancients did, and, indeed, than are fairly warranted by any arguments which unassisted reason can sup¬ ply ; but this only affords a presumption of the powerful, though unacknowledged and perhaps unperceived influence which the Gospel revela¬ tion has exercised even on the minds of those who reject it. They have drunk at that stream of knowledge, which they cannot or will not trace to the real source from which it flows",Cicero,US,8,United States,North America
"As for the ToAver of Babel, it is said indeed in our version that a number of persons joined to¬ gether to build “ a toAver whose top should reach to heaven” (our translators meant an exceeding high toAver), in order that they might not be “ scattered over the face of the whole earth; ” and that God sent on them a confusion of lan¬ guage, Avhich caused them to “ cease building the toAver, and scattered them.” But it is to be ob¬ served that the Avord “ reach ” is supplied by our translators, there being nothing answering to it in the Original, which merely says, “ Avhose top to the heaA^ens.” And the meaning doubtless is, that the top of the toAver should be dedicated to the Heavens  that is, that a temple should be built on it to Bel, Belus, Zeus, or Jupiter; under which titles the ancient Pagans Avorshipped the heavens. For Ave find the historian Herodotus,1 Avho many ages after visited Babylon, expressly declaring that there Avas there, in his time, a very high toAver, on the top of Avhich Avas a temple to Belus ; Avho, he says, Avas the same Avith the Zeus of the Greeks",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"And, moreover, Gentiles who, though they had renounced idolatry, yet did not conform to the whole Law, but only to a certain small number of regulations, were admitted to worship in the outer court of the Temple (“ the court of the Gentiles,” 1 Kings viii. 41), and to attend divine service in the synagogues. These Gentiles are often alluded to in the Book of Acts ( Acts x. 2 ; xiii. 16,26, 43 ; xvi. 14 ; xvii. 4, 17), under the title of “ the de¬ vout,’’5 or “ they who feared God”6 (that is, the Lord Jehovah), such as was Cornelius the cen¬ turion. And after the time of the Captivity, there were, in various countries, many Jews residing dispersed among the Gentiles ;7 and these Gen¬ tiles had thus an opportunity of learning (as a 1 Ay'mnrov ivra xu.)

"Hence the final destruction of that Temple abolished, manifestly and totally, the Mosaic sys¬ tem of religion",Temple,US,8,United States,North America
"And the same may be said of the Pagan reli¬ gions. If it happened that any temple of Jupiter, or Diana, or Woden, were destroyed, this would not hinder the worshippers of those gods from continuing to worship them as before, and from offering sacrifices to them elsewhere",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"But it was not so with the Jews. Their religion was so framed as to make the observance of its ordi¬ nances impossible, when their Temple was finally destroyed. It seems to have been designed and contrived by divine providence, that as their law was to be brought to an end by the Gospel (for which it was a preparation), so, all men were to perceive that it did come to an end, notwithstand¬ ing the obstinate rejection of the Gospel by the greater part of the Jews. It was not left to be a question and a matter of opinion, whether the sacrifices instituted by Moses were to be con¬ tinued or not; but things were so ordered as to put it out of man’s power to continue them",Temple,US,8,United States,North America
"Some of these commandments related to reli¬ gious ceremonies or observances, such as the keep¬ ing of the Feast of the Passover—coming up to the Temple at Jerusalem three times a-year— abstaining from certain meats, and wearing cer¬ tain peculiar garments ; with other things of that kind. These are commonly called ceremonial laws","Temple, Jerusalem","US,IL",8,"United States,Israel","North America,Asia"
"Such men are like the false prophets of old— their language is, “ Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord hath not spoken.” Whatever high preten¬ sions they may make, it is not piety, but daring impiety, thus to mimic the voice of God’s in¬ spired messengers, and to come forward, without any divine commission, setting forth their own fancies as revelations from Heaven. It is not wisdom from above, but gross ignorance of both the volumes which the same divine Author has opened for our instruction—the volume of Nature, and the volume of Revelation,—that leads men thus to confound the ordinary and the extraordi¬ nary dispensations of his Providence. Some design, no doubt, the Allwise Governor of the world must have,in all his dispensations, whether of sorrow or of joy. He sends want, and He sends abundance,—He allots affliction, and tem¬ poral deliverance and prosperity, not at random, but according to some fitness which He perceives in the respective parties, to be the recipients of these dispensations",Providence,US,8,United States,North America
"The reason some give for distinguishing some particular events as “ providential,” is in truth a reason on the opposite side. An unexpected recovery from a disease which seemed hopeless, or a wonderful escape from a shipwreck, &c., is, hey say, more striking to their minds, and impresses them more with a sense of the goodness of Providence than ordinary- occurrences. O J Now, for this very reason, they should labour the more carefully to bring themselves to reflect on the daily benefits they receive from “ Him in whom we live and move and have our being.” The more prone we are to pass by with careless in- i erence our being preserved from falling into a dangerous sickness, or from being shipwrecked at all, the more we s on d study to bring our minds to dwell on such preservation ; which is, in truth, no less “providential” than a man’s being delivered out of a sickness or a shipwreck",Providence,US,8,United States,North America
"Some, however, make a careless use of those common words “ know ” and “ believe.” When discussing questions as to what was “ believed” by such and such persons, they sometimes speak as if there were but these two states of mind,— to believe a certain doctrine, or to disbelieve it; forgetting, apparently, that belief admits of many different degrees, from a mere presumption, up to the most perfect confidence. Yet every one’s own experience might teach him this. For we commonly say, “ I believe so and so is the case, but I am not quite sure'' Some,again, when they speak of what was “known” to the Pagans, or to the Jews, seem to forget that the word “know¬ ledge ” implies three things ;—(1.) Confident be¬ lief; (2.) of what is true ; (3.) on sufficient evi¬ dence. For no one could be said to know any thing that was not true. And again, if any one had before him one of Euclid’s demonstrations, he would not be said to know the conclusion, (though a truth in reality fully proved) if he him¬ self felt at all doubtful about it. And lastly, sup¬ pose two persons were quite positive, the one that the moon is inhabited, and the other that it is uninhabited, neither would be said to know the truth of his opinion ; because, though one or the other must be, in fact, true, there is no suf¬ ficient proof of either",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America
"And Moses, no doubt, would have proceeded in the same manner, had he been a pretender. But he was fully convinced that the Israelites really did live under that miraculous Providence which he described. And their own experience taught them that what he said was true. (Deut. iv. 3, 4.) As for the particulars of all the various instruc¬ tions given to the Israelites, both by Moses and by the other writers of what is called the Old Testament, these are to be learned only from a careful study of those books themselves.

"One necessary circumstance in such a Dispen¬ sation, was, that it should not be like the Mosaic, a local religion. The Jews, indeed, clung (and still cling) to the notion that, even when all the world should be brought to the knowledge of the true God, still their nation should have a pre¬ eminence; and that the Temple of Jerusalem should be the great centre of religious worship for all mankind. And we know there are even some Christians who expect that Jesus Christ is to return to this earth in bodily person, and reign at Jerusalem in great worldly splendour for a thousand years. But such notions are quite at variance with the whole character of the Gospel, as described in our Sacred Books","Temple, Jerusalem, Jerusalem","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"And this, by the way, is a clear proof of his claiming a divine character. For the Jews un¬ derstood (as He well knew) by “the temple of the Lord,” not a synagogue,—a place of assembly for worshippers, but “ the habitation where his honour (glory) dwelleth.” And it is worth remarking, that they also un¬ derstood his calling Himself the “ Son of God,” 1 The word Christian (X^artowos) occurs hut three times in the New Testament, Acts xi. 26, xxvi. 28 ; 1 Peter iv. 16  In no one of these places do we find it applied by Christians themselves to one another. It is mentioned as a name first given to the disciples at Antioch in Syria, doubtless by the Romans, as the word is of Latin formation. King Agrippa, again, uses the word in speaking to Paul, and the Apostle Peter introduces it as denoting what was accounted a crime by the heathen rulers. “ If any man suffer for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed.” 2 There are two words in the original which are both translated “ Temple,” 'isjav, that is, the “ sacred place,” which in¬ cluded the courts of the Temple; and Nao;, (from Nk;&>, “ to dwell,”) the “ House of God,” which was the building in which sacrifices were offered. For this was the main purpose of a temple ; which was not (like the synagogues, and like our churches and chapels) a place for religious assemblies","Antioch, Temple, Temple","US,SY",8,"United States,Syrian Arab Republic","North America,Asia"
"For they did not expect that the Christ was to be a divine person; as is plain from their being unable to solve the question which Jesus put to them, about David’s calling him LORD (Mark xii. 37). When therefore, they understood Him to “make Himself God” (John x. 33), this was so far from favouring their belief in him as the Christ, that it convinced them of his being a false pre¬ tender and a blasphemer",David,PA,8,Panama,North America
"And the Apostles, accordingly, speak of “the LORD (that is, Jesus Christ) being the Spirit (2 Cor. iii. 17), and assure us that “ if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.1’ (Rom. viii. 9.) The same God, then, who to the Israelites, was made known only as Creator and Governor (God the Father), was afterwards manifested to Chris¬ tians as being also the Redeemer (God the Son), and the Sanctifier (God theHoly Ghost): and He is to be acknowledged by them in this threefold manifestation, according to our Saviour’s injunc¬ tion to “ baptise in2 the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” There have been, therefore, in all, three Temples of the ONE GOD ; first, under the Old Dispensation, the Temple at Jerusalem; second¬ ly, during the abode on earth of the Lord Jesus, “ the Temple of his Body;” and, thirdly, (that which is also often called Christ’s body,) (Eph","Temple, Jerusalem, Temple","US,IL",8,"United States,Israel","North America,Asia"
"Any one who looks at the account of Paul’s taking leave of the Elders of Ephesus and Miletus (Acts xx.), whom he expected never to see again, will plainly see that he could not possibly have had any notion of any supreme central authority, lodged either in the church of Jerusalem, or of Rome, or in Peter and his successors, or in any General Council. For he there directly foretells that false teachers should arise out of their own body [that is, from amongst the clergy], and anxi¬ ously impresses on them the best advice he could think of for guarding against such a danger. Yet that advice is only to watch, and remember what he had taught them. This seems to imply that each particular church was left sufficient means within itself of ascertaining the true doctrine of Christ, continuing, and preserving it; but that the actual preservation of such doctrine depended on the watchfulness of the churches themselves","Jerusalem, Rome","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"Now, there did exist something of this kind under the Mosaic Dispensation. The “ devout Gentiles” (sometimes called “ Proselytes1 of the Gate”), were admitted to worship in the outer court of the Temple, and to frequent the Syna¬ gogues. Those who had embraced the whole Mosaic Law (who were called “ Proselytes of righteousness”) were accounted as ranking higher than the others, and next in holiness to the Israel¬ ites by birth. Then, of the born Israelites, the Levites were more especially dedicated to the Lord than those of the other Tribes, and were em¬ ployed in his immediate Service about the Taber¬ nacle, or the Temple. Of the Levites themselves, again, the family of Aaron were alone admissible to the priesthood. And lastly, of the Priests themselves, none except the high priest was per¬ mitted to enter the Holy of Holies,—where he offered the yearly sacrifice on the great day of atonement","Temple, Temple, Of","US,IL,TR",8,"United States,Israel,Turkey","North America,Asia,Asia"
"One Israelite (and the like maybe said of Chris¬ tians) might exceed another of the same Tribe and Family, in pious obedience to the Lord; and a third might surpass them both. But these dif¬ ferences would not be distinctions introduced by the Mosaic Religion; but merely those of the in¬ dividual characters of those men. And again, a pious Israelite, of superior understanding, and of a reflecting turn of mind, and of more extensive knowledge than the generality, would have a clearer, and more intelligent, and more compre¬ hensive view of some parts of the Revelation given him, and of God’s Providence generally, than an¬ other, equally pious, but of humbler powers and attainments. And the like must be the case with Christians also",Providence,US,8,United States,North America
"But it was almost equally at variance with many of the notions of the Heathen also. And these latter had nearly as much difficulty in receiving a religion from Jews—a people generally de¬ spised by them—as the J ews had, in acknow¬ ledging the “Gentiles” as fellow-heirs with them¬ selves. And both parties—Jews and Gentiles— had never conceived an idea of such a thing as a religion without any literal Temple, without an A Itar, without Sacrifices, and without any Sacri¬ ficing Priest on earth",Temple,US,8,United States,North America
"And it may be added, that any one who is thus induced to give himself up implicitly to the guid¬ ance of such a Supposed infallible authority, with¬ out presuming thenceforth to exercise his own judgment on any point relative to religion, or to think for himself at all on such matters,—such a one will be likely to regard this procedure as the very perfection of pious humility,—as a most reverent observance of the rule of “ lean not to thine own understandingthough, in reality, it is the very error of leaning improperly to our own understanding. For to resolve to believe that God must have dealt with mankind just in the way that we could wish as the most desirable, and in the way that to us seems the most pro¬ bable ; this is in fact to set up ourselves as his judges. It is to dictate to Him in the spirit of Naaman, who thought that the prophet would re¬ cover him by a touch, and who chose to be healed by the waters of Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, which he deemed better than all the waters of Israel",Damascus,"IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"But it is notorious, that such was not the de¬ sign of Providence : and that no such guide does exist. Of all the persons who have claimed infal- libity, there is none who has displayed (as Paul did) “ the signs of an apostle,” that is, such palpable and undeniable miraculous powers, as to leave no doubt in any candid mind, of his being really inspired. And since the very purpose for which an infallible guide is supposed to be need¬ ed, is, the removal of all reasonable doubts, it is plain that if God had thought fit to provide us with such a guide, He would not have left it at all doubtful where we were to look for that guide","Providence, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"For example, the prejudice of the Jews in favour of their own nation and institutions, gave rise to that very early heresy above noticed (see Acts xv., and Gal. ii.), of those who taught that all Christians were bound to keep the Mosaic Law ; or at least, that such as did so had attained a superior degree of sanctity. The violation of the UNITY [Oneness] of Christ’s religion, by thus dividing Christians into two classes, ad¬ mitted to different degrees of religious privilege, has been already noticed. The sect of Judaizing Christians, however, thus founded, seems not to have lasted long. The destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple appears to have soon put an end to it. But the general tendency towards this violation of Christian Unity, being not peculiar to the Jews, but a part of human nature, has shewn itself again and again, under various forms, in various portions of the Church","Jerusalem, Temple","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"For example, there have been in almost all Ages of the Church, persons who have taught that Jesus Christ is to come upon earth and reign in great worldly splendour at Jerusalem for a thou¬ sand years; which period is thence called Mil¬ lenium. And superior privileges, as God’s pecu¬ liar People, are then to be restored (according to this doctrine) to the Jews ; that is, to such Jews as shall have continued unbelievers ; not, to the descendants of those great multitudes of them who embraced Christianity in the days of the Apostles, and since, and who thereupon soon be¬ came blended with the Gentile Christians. But the remnant of the Jews who shall have obsti¬ nately rejected the Gospel up to that time, are then to be restored to their own land, and to have a superiority in God’s sight over men of Gentile race. And the Temple at Jerusalem is to be restored, and to be again the place of peculiar holiness, whither all men are to resort to wor¬ ship","Jerusalem, Temple, Jerusalem","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"Now these expectations of a Christ, who is to be a great and victorious temporal king, and of a kingdom of earthly glory, and of the restoration of the Temple, and of the exaltation of the Jews above all other people, are precisely those which the Jewish nation were so wedded to when our Lord came, and which led most of them to reject Him",Temple,US,8,United States,North America
"The Apostles, though attentive to the regular government of the churches they founded, or¬ daining, for various services, Elders, and other Ministers, male and female, (the latter being known by the title of “ Widows,”) yet appointed no order of Priests in the sense of Hierews (familiar as they must have been with the name), answer¬ ing to the sacrificing Priests of the Jewish and of the Pagan religions. The same observation will apply to the Temple. The term was fami¬ liar to the New Testament writers; but it is never once applied by them to a Christian place of wor¬ ship ; always to the worshippers themselves col¬ lectively;—to the Christian congregation; as e.g",Temple,US,8,United States,North America

The power also of many of their gods was supposed to be limited to particular places, or to particular offices.

"And this is proved by what has actually taken place. It is well known that at the time of Lu¬ ther’s Reformation, and long before, the translat¬ ing of the Scriptures into modern languages was most earnestly opposed by those who adhered to the Church of Rome. The Scriptures, which were originally addressed to Christians of all classes, including slaves, were represented as unfit for the perusal of the common people. But since then, the Roman Catholics have in some measure followed the example of those Churches which they denounce as heretical.1 They have among them now, (though not in perfectly free circula¬ tion,) translations of Scripture into English, French, Italian, and other languages. And.some of them have also Prayer-books, with the Latin and their own language printed in parallel co¬ lumns, so as to enable them to understand the Service that is going on.2 3 There can be little doubt, therefore, that this would have been done long before, if there had been all along numerous independent Churches, such as the Apostles esta¬ blished",Rome,"US,UK,FR,IT",8,"United States,N/A,France,Italy","North America,N/A,Europe,Europe"
"The causes above mentioned have proved, in very many instances, great hindrances to need¬ ful reforms. Nevertheless, many attempts were made, in the earlier Ages of the Church, to intro¬ duce errors and abuses, which were vigorously and often successfully resisted. We have on re¬ cord many varieties of false doctrine and corrupt worship, (most of them now nearly forgotten,) 1 This great and important change completely disproves what is maintained by the advocates, and by the bitterest enemies, of the Church of Rome—the unchangeable character of that Church.

"When several distinct Churches had been esta¬ blished in revolt—the members of them having been compelled to secede from the Community they had belonged to, on account of a disagree¬ ment as to the fundamentals of Christianity—the result was, that the ideas of distinctness, and of disagreement, often came to be, in some measure, blended together in men’s minds. There was a sort of presumption created, that any Churches independent of each other may be expected to be at variance. That mutual friendly feeling and free inter-communion which prevailed in the earliest ages—when an Ephesian Christian, for instance, going to settle at Corinth, or at any other place where there was a Christian Church, and bringing proper testimonials, was at once received as a member of that Church—were much impaired, and sometimes forgotten",Corinth,US,8,United States,North America
"543 civil wars. For example, every one knows that Norway was formerly united, not to Sweden, but to Denmark—that, in like manner, Normandy, and other provinces of France, and also the North American States, formerly belonged to England; and that Ireland at one time consisted of several independent Kingdoms. But if a Norman were to hold that he owed no allegiance to the French Government, or an American to that of the United States, and so on, unless every such separation and annexation could be proved ori¬ ginally justifiable, and if every man were to think himself authorised on such grounds to raise revolt, there would be hardly such a thing as a peaceable Government on Earth",Norman,"US,FR,NO,SE,DK,IE",8,"United States,France,Norway,Sweden,Denmark,Ireland","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"But difficult questions may arise when both parties do not thus agree ; those who desire to form themselves into a distinct Church being opposed by the rest. Suppose, for instance, that on the occasion just alluded to, the English Church had refused to consent to the independ¬ ence of the American, and had insisted on re¬ taining control over them. In any such case, those desiring to secede should, in the first place, satisfy themselves, on careful considera¬ tion, that the evils they seek to remedy are not only real, but great, and likely to inter¬ fere with the objects for which Churches exist",,"UK,US",8,"N/A,United States","N/A,North America"
"There had been men who could compute the area of a triangle, draw a meridian line, or even construct a sun-dial, in the worst of times; but between such skill, and the capacity to under¬ stand or the taste to relish the demonstrations of Euclid, Apollonius, or Archimedes, there was a great interval, and many difficulties were to be overcome, for which much time, and much subsidiary knowledge, were necessary. The repo¬ sitories of the ancient treasures were to be open¬ ed, and made accessible; the knowledge of the languages was to be acquired; the manuscripts were to be deciphered; and the skill of the grammarian and the critic were to precede, in a certain degree, that of the geometrician or the astronomer. The obligations which we have to those who undertook this laborious and irksome task, and who rescued the ancient books from the prisons to which ignorance and barbarism had condemned them, and from the final de¬ struction by which they must soon have been overtaken, are such as we can never sufficiently acknowledge; and indeed we shall never know even the names of many of the benefactors to whom our thanks are due. In the midst of the wars, the confusion, and bloodshed, which over¬ whelmed Europe during the middle ages, the religious houses and monasteries afforded to the remains of ancient learning an asylum, which a salutary prejudice forced even the most lawless to respect; and the authors who have given the best account of the revival of letters, agree that it is in a great measure to those establishments DISSERTATION' FOURTH",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America

"The study of the remains of antiquity gradual¬ ly produced men of taste and intelligence, who were able to correct the faults of the manu¬ scripts they copied, and to explain the difficul¬ ties of the authors they translated. Such were Purbach, Regiomontanus, Commandine, Mau- rolycus, and many others. By their means, the writings of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Pappus, became known and acces¬ sible to men of science. Arabia contributed its share towards this great renovation, and from the language of that country was derived the know¬ ledge of many Greek books, of the originals of which, some were not found till long afterwards, and others have never yet been discovered",Euclid,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"In nothing, perhaps, is the inventive and ele¬ gant genius of the Greeks better exemplified than in their geometry. The elementary truths of that science were connected by Euclid into one great chain, beginning from the axioms, and extending to the properties of the five regu¬ lar solids; the whole digested into such admir¬ able order, and explained with such clearness and precision, that no similar wmrk of superior excellence has appeared, even in the present ad¬ vanced state of mathematical science",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America

"What I here assert is on the authority of Mon- tucla, whose judgment in this matter may he safely relied on, as he has shown, by many in¬ stances, that he was well acquainted with the nature of the analysis referred to. It is not a little remarkable that Werner should have under¬ stood this subject, when we find many eminent mathematicians, long after his time, entiicly unacquainted with it, and continually express¬ ing their astonishment how the ancient geo¬ meters found out those simple and elegant con¬ structions and demonstrations, of which they have given so many examples. In the days of Werner there was no ancient hook known, ex¬ cept the Data of Euclid, from which any infor¬ mation concerning the geometrical analysis could he collected; and it is highly to his credit, that, without any other help, he should have come to the knowledge of a method not a little recondite in its principles, and ampng the finest inventions either of ancient or of modern science. Werner resolved, by means of it, Archimedes’s problem of cutting a sphere into two segments, having a given ratio to one another. He proposed also to translate, from the Arabic, the work of Apollo¬ nius, entitled Sectio Ratio?iis, rightly judging it to he an elementary work in that analysis, and to come next after the Data of Euclid.2 Benedetto, an Italian mathematician, appears also to have been very early acquainted with the principles of the same ingenious method, as he published a hook on the geometrical analysis at Turin in 1585","Euclid, Euclid, Turin","US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"In the early part of the seventeenth century, Cavalieri was particularly distinguished, and made an advance in the higher geometry, which occupies the middle place between the discoveries of Archimedes and those of Newton",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"555 facility with which it could be managed, fur¬ nished a most ready method of ascertaining the ratios of areas and solids to one another, and, therefore, scarcely seems to deserve the epithet which Newton himself bestows upon it, of involving in its conceptions something harsh, [durum) and not easy to be admitted. It was the doctrine of infinitely small quantities carried to the extreme, and gave at once the result of an infinite, series of successive approximations",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The other properties of this curve, those that respect its tangents, its length, its curvature, &c. exercised the ingenuity, not only of the geometers just mentioned, but of Wren, Wallis, Huygens, and, even after the invention of the integral calculus, of Newton, Leibnitz, and Ber¬ noulli",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Afterwards the geometry of infinites fell into the hands of Leibnitz and Newton, and acquired that new character which marks so distinguished an era in the mathematical sciences",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Though in all this the moderns received none of their information from the Greeks, yet a work in the Greek language, treating of arithmetical questions, in a manner that may be accounted algebraic, was discovered in the course of the next century, and given to the world, in a Latin translation, by Xylander, in 1575. This is the work of Diophantus of Alexandria, who had composed thirteen books of Arithmetical Ques¬ tions, and is supposed to have flourished about 150 years after the Christian era. The ques¬ tions he resolves are often of considerable diffi¬ culty ; and a great deal of address is displayed in stating them, so as to bring out equations of such a form as to involve only one power of the unknown quantity. The expression is that of common language, abbreviated and assisted by a few symbols. The investigations do not ex¬ tend beyond quadratic equations; they are, however, extremely ingenious, and prove the author to have been a man of talent, though the instrument he worked with was weak and im- pei’fect",Alexandria,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"He afterwards devoted himself entirely to the study of the Mathematics; and it appears from some of his manuscripts, lately discovered, that he observed the spots of the sun as early as De¬ cember 1610, not more than a month later than Galileo. He also made observations on Jupiter’s satellites, and on the comets of 1607 and of 1618.1 1 The manuscripts which contain these observations, and probably many other things of great interest, are preserved in the collection of the Earl of Egremont, having come into the possession of his family from Henry Percy, Earl of Northum¬ berland, a most liberal patron of science, with whom Harriot appears to have chiefly lived after his return from Virginia","Jupiter, Virginia","US,ZA",8,"United States,South Africa","North America,Africa"
"Archimedes, therefore, is the person who first made the application of Mathematics to Natural Philosophy. No individual, perhaps, ever laid the foundation of more great discoveries than that geometer, of whom Wallis has said with so much truth, “ Yir stupendse sagacitatis, qui prima fundamenta posuit inventionum fere omnium, in quibus promovendis setas nostra gloriatur.” The mechanical inquiries, begun by the geo¬ meter of Syracuse, were extended by Ctesibius and Hero; by Anthemius of Tralles ; and, last¬ ly, by Pappus Alexandrinus. Ctesibius and Hero were the first who analyzed mechanical engines, reducing them all to combinations of five simple mechanical contrivances, to which they gave the name of Awa/uiz, or Powers, the same which they retain at the present moment",Syracuse,US,8,United States,North America
"But, in the thirteenth century, an appeal from the authority of the schools, even to nature her¬ self, could not be made with impunity. Bacon, accordingly, incurred the displeasure both of the University and of the Church; and this forms one of his claims to the respect of posterity, as it is but fair to consider persecution inflicted by the ignorant and bigoted as equivalent to praise bestowed by the liberal and enlightened",University,US,8,United States,North America
"Much more recently, Gilbert, in his treatise on the Magnet, had given an example of an ex¬ perimental inquiry, carried on with more cor¬ rectness, and more enlarged views, than had been done by any of his predecessors. Never¬ theless, in the end of the sixteenth century, it might still be affirmed, that the situation of the great avenue to knowledge was fully understood by none, and that its existence, to the bulk of philosophers, was utterly unknown","Much, Gilbert","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"Bacon complains, that the chemists of his time, from a few experiments with the furnace and the crucible, thought that they were furnished with principles sufficient to explain the struc¬ ture of the universe ; and he censures Aristotle for having depraved his Physics so much with his Dialectics, as to render the former entirely a science of words and controversy. In like man¬ ner, he blames a philosopher of his own age, Gilbert, who had studied magnetism to good purpose, for having proceeded to form out of it a general system of philosophy. Such things have occurred in every period of science. Thus, electricity has been applied to explain the mo¬ tion of the heavenly bodies ; and, of late, galva¬ nism and electricity together have been held out as explaining not only the affinities of Chemistry, but the phenomena of gravitation, and the laws of vegetable and animal life. It were a good caution for a man who studies nature, to distrust those things with which he is particularly con¬ versant, and which he is accustomed to contem¬ plate with pleasure",Gilbert,US,8,United States,North America
"When philosophy takes all its principles from a few facts, he calls it empirical,—such as was that of Gilbert, and of the chemists",Gilbert,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus, of the cause or form of colour now in¬ quired into, instantice solitaries are found in crys¬ tals, prisms of glass, drops of dew, which occa¬ sionally exhibit colour, and yet have nothing in common with the stones, flowers, and metals, which possess colour permanently, except the colour itself. Hence Bacon concludes, that co¬ lour is nothing else than a modification of the rays of light, produced, in the first case, by the different degrees of incidence; and, in the se¬ cond, by the texture or constitution of the sur¬ faces of bodies. He may be considered as very lortunate in fixing on these examples ; for it was by means of them that Newton afterwards found out the composition of light",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Comparative anatomy is full of analogies of this kind, which are most instructive, and use¬ ful guides to discovery. It was by remarking in the blood-vessels a contrivance similar to the valves used in hydraulic engines, for preventing the counter-current of a fluid, that Harvey was led to the discovery of the circulation of the blood. The analogies between natural and arti¬ ficial productions arc always highly deserving of notice",Harvey,US,8,United States,North America
"Such, to employ examples which the progress of science has unfolded^since the'time of Bacon, are the air-pump and the barometer for mani¬ festing the weight and elasticity of air; the measurement of the velocity of light, by means of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and the aberration of the fixed stars; the experi¬ ments in electricity and galvanism, and in the greater part of pneumatic chemistry. In all these instances things are made known which before had entirely escaped the senses",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"587 der certain conditions, it may be attended with the greatest advantage. He knew also in what manner this application had been abused by the Platonists, who had attempted, by means of geo¬ metry, to establish the first principles of Physics, or had used them, in axiomalis constituendis, which is exactly the province belonging exclusively to experience. At the same time, he pointed out, with great precision, the place which the Mathe¬ matics may legitimately occupy, as serving to measure and compare the objects of physical in¬ quiry. He did not, however, perceive before¬ hand, nor was it possible that he should, the vast extent to which the application of that science was capable of being carried. In the book De Augmentis, he has made many excellent remarks on this subject, full of the sagacity which pene¬ trated so far into futurity, but, nevertheless, could only perceive a small part of the scene which the genius of Newton was afterwards to unfold",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus, suppose that, after the nature of the reflection and refraction of light, and particu¬ larly of the colours produced by the latter, had been discovered by experiment, the cause of the rainbow were to be inquired into. It would, after a little consideration, appear probable, that the phenomenon to be explained depends on the reflection and refraction of light by the rain fall¬ ing from a cloud opposite to the sun. Now, since the nature of reflection and refraction are supposed known, we have the principles previ¬ ously ascertained which are likely to assist in the explanation of the rainbow. We have no occasion, therefore, to enter on the inquiry, as if the powers to be investigated were wholly un¬ known. It is the combination of them only which is unknown, and our business is to seek so to combine them, that the result may corre¬ spond with the appearances. This last is precise¬ ly what Newton accomplished, when, by deduc¬ ing from the known laws of refraction and re¬ flection the breadth of the coloured arch, the dia¬ meter of the circle of which it is a part, and the relation of the latter to the place of the specta¬ tor and of the sun, he found all these to come out from his calculus, just as they are observed in nature. Thus he proved the truth of his solu¬ tion by the most clear and irresistible evidence",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"\ Galileo extended the theory of motion still farther. He had begun, while pursuing his stu¬ dies at the University of Pisa, to make expeii- ments on the descent of falling bodies, and dis¬ covered the fact, that heavy and light bodies fall to the ground from the same height in the same time, or in times so nearly the same that the difference can only be ascribed to the resistance of the air. From observing the vibrations of the lamps in the cathedral, he also arrived at this very important conclusion in mechanics, that the great and the small vibrations of the same pendulum are performed in the same time, and that this time depends only on the length of the pendulum. The date of these observations goes back as far as the year lo83","University, Pisa","US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"

"595 The laws which actually regulate the collision of bodies remained unknown till some years later, when they were recommended by the Royal So¬ ciety of London to the particular attention of its members. Three papers soon appeared, in which these laws were all correctly laid down, though no one of the authors had any knowledge of the conclusions obtained by the other two. The first of these was read to the Society, in November 1668, by Dr Wallis of Oxford; the next by Sir Christopher Wren in the month following; and the third by Huygens in January 1669.

"The first considerable improvements made on the air-pump are due to Mr Boyle.

His experiments were farther extended,^—they placed the weight and elasti¬ city of the air in a variety of new lights,—they made known the power of air to dissolve water, &c. Boyle had great skill in contriving, and great dexterity in performing experiments. He had, indeed, very early applied himself to the prosecution of experimental science, and was one of the members of the small but distin¬ guished body who, during the civil wars, held private meetings for cultivating natural know¬ ledge, on the plan of Bacon.

Purbach was fixed at Vienna by the patronage of the Em¬ peror Frederick the Third, and devoted himself to astronomical observation. He published a new edition of the Almagest, and, though he neither understood Greek nor Arabic, his know¬ ledge of the subject enabled him to make it much more perfect than any of the former trans¬ lations.

"The first edition of the Aslronomia Instaurata, the publication of which was solicited by Cardi¬ nal Schoenberg, and the book itself dedicated to the Pope, appeared in 1543, a few days before the death of the author. Throughout the whole book, the new doctrine was advanced with great caution, as if from a presentiment of the opposi¬ tion and injustice which it was one day to ex¬ perience. At first, however, the system attract¬ ed little notice, and was rejected by the greater part even of astronomers. It lay fermenting in secret with other new discoveries for more than fifty years, till, by the exertions of Galileo, it was kindled into so bright a flame as to consume the philosophy of Aristotle, to alarm the hierar¬ chy of Rome, and to threaten the existence of every opinion not founded on experience and observation",Rome,US,8,United States,North America

Near it, as he saw it for the first time, were three luminous points ranged in a straight line, two of them on one side of the planet, and one on the other. This occasioned no surprise, for they might he small stars not visible to the naked eye, such as he had already discovered in great numbers.

"In the year 1633, Galileo, now seventy years old, being brought before the Inquisition, was forced solemnly to disavow his belief in the earth’s motion; and condemned to perpetual imprisonment, though the sentence was after¬ wards mitigated, and he was allowed to return to Florence.1 The Court of Rome was very careful to publish this second recantation all over Europe, thinking, no doubt, that it was ad¬ ministering a complete antidote to the belief ot the Copernican system. The sentence, indeed, appears to have pressed very heavily on Galileo’s mind, and he never afterwards either talked or wrote on the subject of astronomy.

"The first transit of Venus which was observed, happened a few years later, in 1639, when it was seen in England by Horrox and his friend Crabtree, and by them only. Horrox, who was a young man of great genius, had himself cal¬ culated the transit, and foretold the time very accurately, though the astronomical tables of that day gave different results; and those of Kepler, in which he confided the most, Avere, in this instance, considerably in error. Horrox has also the merit of being among the first who rightly appreciated the discoveries of the astron¬ omer just named. He had devoted much time to astronomical observation, and, though he died very young, he left behind him some prepara¬ tions for computing tables of the moon, on a principle which was new, and which Newton himself thought worthy of being adopted in his theory of the inequalities of that planet",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"An hypothesis advanced by Ward, bishop of Salisbury, was simpler and more accurate than that of the French astronomer. According to it, the line drawn from a planet to the superior focus of its elliptic orbit, turns with a uniform angular Arelocity round that point. In orbits of small eccentricity, this is nearly true, and al¬ most coincides in such cases with Kepler’s prin¬ ciple of the uniform description of areas. Dr Ward, however, did not consider the matter in that light; he assumed his hypothesis as true, guided, it would seem, by nothing but the opin¬ ion, that a centre of uniform motion must some- where exist, and pleased with the simplicity thus introduced into astronomical calculation. It is indeed remarkable, as Montucla has observed, how little the most enlightened astronomers of that time seem to have studied or under¬ stood the laws discovered by Kepler. Riccioli, of whom we are just about to speak, enumerates all the suppositions that had been laid down concerning the velocities of the planets, but makes no mention of their describing equal areas in equal times round the sun. Even Cassini, great as he was in astronomy, cannot he entire¬ ly exempted from this censure",Salisbury,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Though Galileo had discovered the satellites of Jupiter, their times of revolution, and even 614 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"some of their inequalities, it yet remained to de¬ fine their motions with precision, and to con¬ struct tables for calculating their places. This task was performed by the elder Cassini, who was invited from Italy, his native country, b\ Louis the Fourteenth, and settled in France in 1669. His tables of the satellites had been pub¬ lished at Bologna three years before, and he continued to improve them, by a series of ob¬ servations made in the observatory at Paris, with great diligence and accuracy","Bologna, Paris","IT,FR,US",8,"Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"The theory of the motions of these small bodies is a research of great difficulty, and had been attempted by many astronomers before Cassini, with very little success. The planes of the orbits, their inclinations to the orbit of Jupiter, and the lines in which they intersected that orbit, were all to be determined, as well as the times of revolution, and the distances of each from its primary. Add to this, that it is only in a few points of their orbits that they can be observed with advantage. The best are at the times of immersion into the shadow of Jupiter, and emersion from it. The same excellent astronomer discovered four satellites of Saturn, in addition to that already observed by Huy¬ gens. He also discovered the rotation of Jupi¬ ter and of Mars upon their axes","Jupiter, Jupiter, Huy","US,BE",8,"United States,Belgium","North America,Europe"
"The constant attention bestowed on the eclip¬ ses of the satellites of Jupiter, made an inequa¬ lity he remarked in the periods of their return, which seemed to depend on the position of the earth relatively to Jupiter and the sun, and not, as the inequalities of that sort might have been expected to do, on the place of Jupiter in his orbit. From the opposition of Jupiter to the sun, till the conjunction, it was found that the observed emersion of the satellites from the shadow fell more and more behind the comput¬ ed ; the differences amounting near the conjunc¬ tion to about fourteen minutes. When, after the conjunction, the immersions were observed, an acceleration was remarked, just equal to the for¬ mer retardation; so that, at the opposition, the eclipse happened fourteen minutes sooner than by the calculation","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"The first person who offered an explanation of these facts was Olaus Roemer, a Danish as¬ tronomer. He observed that the increase of the retardation corresponded nearly to the increase of the earth’s distance from Jupiter, and converse¬ ly, the acceleration to the diminution of that dis¬ tance. Hence it occurred to him, that it was to the time which light requires to traverse those distances that the whole series of pheno¬ mena was to he ascribed. This explanation was so simple and satisfactory, that it was readily received",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"Why did not an equation or allowance of the same kind arise from the position of Jupiter, with respect to his aphelion, for, all other things being the same, his distance from the earth must he greater, as he was nearer to that point of his orbit ? Both these difficulties have since been completely removed. If the aforesaid inequality was not for some time observed in any satellite but the first, it was only because the motions of the first are the most regular, and were the soonest understood; hut it now appears that the same equation belongs to all the satellites. The solution of Maraldi’s difficulty is similar; for the quantity of what is called the equation of the light, is now known to be affected by Jupi¬ ter’s place in his orbit",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"About the middle of the seventeenth century were formed those associations of scientific men, which, under the appellation of Academies or Philosophical Societies, have contributed so much to the advancement of knowledge in Eu¬ rope. The Academia del Cimento of Florence, founded in 1651, carried in its name the im¬ pression of the new philosophy.

"It has been already remarked, that, during the civil wars, a number of learned and scientific men sought, in the retirement of Oxford, an asylum from the troubles to which the country was then a prey. They had met as early as 1645; most of them were attached to the royal cause; and after the restoration of Charles the Second, they were incorporated by a royal char¬ ter in 1662",Oxford,US,8,United States,North America
"The first idea of this institution seems to have been suggested by the writings of Bacon, who, in recommending the use of experiment, had severely censured the schools, colleges, and aca¬ demies of his own time, as adverse to the ad¬ vancement of knowledge;1 * * * and, in the Nova Atlantis, had given a most interesting sketch of the form of a society directed to scientific im¬ provement. In Germany, the Academia Natures Curiosorum dates its commencement from 1652; and the historian of that institution ascribes the spirit which produced it to the writings of the philosopher just named. These examples, and a feeling that the union and co-operation of numbers were necessary to the progress of expe¬ rimental philosophy, operated still more exten¬ sively. The Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris was founded in 1666, in the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, and during the administration of Colbert. The Institute of Bologna in Italy belongs nearly to the same period; but almost all the other philosophical associations, of which there are now so many, had their beginning in the eighteenth century","Atlantis, Paris, Bologna","IT,ZA,US",8,"Italy,South Africa,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"The fact is otherwise; they were often the fastnesses from which prejudice and error were latest in being expelled. They joined in persecuting the reformers of science. It has been seen, that the masters of the University of Paris were angry with Galileo for the experiments on the descent of bodies. Even the University of Oxford brought on itself the indelible disgrace of persecuting, in Friar Bacon, the first man who appears to have had a distinct view of the means by which the knowledge of the laws of nature must be acquired 616 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","University, Paris, University, Oxford",US,8,United States,North America
"The Academy of Sciences in Paris was not exactly an institution of the same kind. It con¬ sisted of three classes of members, one of which, the PensionnaireS) twenty in number, had sala¬ ries paid by Government, and were bound in their turn to furnish the meetings with scien¬ tific memoirs; and each of them also, at the be¬ ginning of every year, was expected to give an account of the work in which he was to he em¬ ployed. This institution has been of incredible advantage to science. To detach a number of ingenious men from every thing but scientific pursuits; to deliver them alike from the embar¬ rassments of poverty or the temptations of wealth; to give them a place and station in society the most respectable and independent, is to remove every impediment, and to add every stimulus to exertion. To this institution, ac¬ cordingly, operating upon a people of great ge¬ nius and indefatigable activity of mind, we are to ascribe that superiority in the mathematical sciences which, for the last seventy years, has been so conspicuous",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"The establishment of astronomical observa¬ tories, as national or royal works, is connected in Europe with the institution of scientific or philosophical societies. The necessity of the former was, indeed, even more apparent than that of the latter. A science which has the heavenly bodies for its object, ought, as far as possible, to be exempted from the vicissitudes of the earth. As it gains strength but slowly, and requires ages to complete its discoveries, the plan of observation must not be limited by the life of the individual who pursues it, but must be followed out in the same place, year after year, to an unlimited extent. A perception of this truth, however indistinct, seems, from the earliest times, to have suggested the utility of observatories, to those sovereigns who patronized astronomy, whether they looked to that science for real or imaginary instruction. The circle of Osymandias is the subject of one of the most ancient traditions in science, and has preserved the name of a prince which otherwise would have been entirely unknown. A building, dedi¬ cated to astronomy, made a conspicuous part of the magnificent establishment of the school of Alexandria. During the middle ages, in the course of the migrations of science toward the east, sumptuous buildings, furnished with astro¬ nomical instruments, rose successively in the plains of Mesopotamia, and among the moun¬ tains of Tartary.

"On the revival of letters in Europe, establish¬ ments of the same kind were the first decisive indications of a taste for science. We have seen the magnificent observatory on which Tycho ex¬ pended his private fortune, and employed the munificence of his patron, become a sad memo¬ rial (after the signal services which it had ren¬ dered to astronomy) of the instability of what¬ ever depends on individual greatness. The ob¬ servatories at Paris and London were secured from a similar fate, by being made national es¬ tablishments, where a succession of astronomers were to devote themselves to the study of the heavens. The observatory at Paris was begun in 1667, and that at Greenwich in 1675. In the first of these, La Hire and Cassini, in the second, Flamsteed and Halley, are at the head of a series of successors who have done honour to their respective nations. If there be in Britain any establishment, in the success and conduct of which the nation has reason to boast, it is that of the Royal Observatory, which, in spite of a climate which so continually tries the pa¬ tience, and so often disappoints the hopes of the astronomer, has furnished a greater number of observations to be completely relied on, than all the rest of Europe put together, and afforded the data for those tables in which the French mathematicians have expressed, with such accu¬ racy, the past, the present, and the future con¬ dition of the heavens","Paris, London, Paris","US,GB,FR",8,"United States,United Kingdom,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The measurement of an arch of the meridian was attempted by Eratosthenes of Alexandria, in perfect conformity with that principle, but by means very inadequate to the importance and difficulty of the problem. By measuring the sun’s distance from the zenith of Alexandria on the solstitial day, and by knowing, as he thought he did, that on the same day the sun was ex¬ actly in the zenith of Syene, he found the dis¬ tance in the heavens between the parallels of those places to be 7° 12', or a 50th part of the circumference of a great circle. Supposing, then, that Alexandria and Syene were in the same meridian, nothing more was required than to find the distance between them, which, when multiplied by 50, would give the circumference of the globe. The manner in which this was attempted by Eratosthenes, is quite characteris¬ tic of the infant state of the arts of experiment and observation. He took no trouble to ascer¬ tain whether Alexandria and Syene were due north and south of one another: the truth is, that the latter is considerably east of the former; so that, though their horizontal distance had been accurately known, a considerable reduction would have been necessary, on account of the distance of the one from the meridian of the other. It does not appear, however, that Era¬ tosthenes was at any more pains to ascertain the distance than the bearing of the two places. He assumed the former just as it was commonly es¬ timated ; and, indeed, it appears that the dis¬ tance was not measured till long afterwards, when it was done by the command of Nero","Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria",US,8,United States,North America
"A computation which, for the time, deserves considerable praise, is that of Norwood, in 1635, who measured the distance between London and York, taking the bearings as he proceeded along the road, and reducing all to the direction of the meridian, and to the horizontal plane. The dif¬ ference of latitude he found, by observation of tbe solstices, to be 2° 28'; and from that and his measured distance, he concluded the degree to be 367,176 feet English, or 57,800 toises. This has been found to be a near approximation; yet his method was not capable of great accuracy, nor did he always execute it in the best manner","Norwood, London, York","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"“ Sometimes,” says he, “ I measured, sometimes I paced ; and I believe I am within a scantling of the truth.” Fernel, a French physician, measured with a wheel from Paris to Amiens, which are nearly in the same meridian, and he determined the de¬ gree from thence to be 56,746 French toises ; a result which falls short of the truth, though not very considerably","Paris, Amiens","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The most remarkable circumstance, however, which occurred in the course of this voyage, was, that the clock, though furnished with a pendu¬ lum of the same length which vibrated seconds at Paris, was found, at Cayenne, to lose two minutes and a half a-day nearly. This created great astonishment in France, especially after the accuracy of it was confirmed by the observa¬ tions of Varin and Deshayes, who, some years afterwards, visited different places on the coasts of Africa and America, near the line, and found the necessity of shortening the pendulum, to make it vibrate seconds in those latitudes. The first explanation of this remarkable phenomenon was given by Newton, in the third book of his Principia, published in 1687, where it is de¬ duced as a necessary consequence of the earth’s rotation on its axis, and of the centrifugal force thence arising. That force changes both the di¬ rection and the intensity of gravity, giving to the earth an oblate spheroidal figure, more elevated at the equator than the poles, and making bodies fall, and pendulums vibrate, more slowly in low than in high latitudes","Paris, Cayenne, Newton","US,FR,GF",8,"United States,France,French Guiana","North America,Europe,South America"
"This solution, however, did not, any more than the book in which it was contained, make its way very readily into France. The first expla¬ nation of the retardation of the pendulum, which was received there, was given by Huygens in 1690. Huygens deduced it also from the cen¬ trifugal force, arising from the earth’s rotation, and the view which he took was simpler, though much less accurate than that of Newton. It had indeed the simplicity which often arises from neglecting one of the essential conditions of a problem; but it was nevertheless ingenious, and involved a very accurate knowledge of the nature of centrifugal force.—I am thus brought to touch on a subject which belongs properly to the second part of this Dissertation, for which the fuller discussion of it must of course be reserved",Newton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"however, only two physical principles which have completely stood the test of subsequent impiove- ment. The first of these is the proposition just referred to, that a point in any object is seen in the direction of a straight line drawn from the eye to that point; and the second is, that when a point in an object is seen by reflection from a polished surface, the lines drawn from the eye and from the object to the point whence the re¬ flection is made, are equally inclined to the re¬ flecting surface. These propositions are assum¬ ed as true: they were, no doubt, known before the time of Euclid ; and it is supposed that the discovery of them was the work of the Platonic school. The first of them is the foundation of Optics proper, or the theory of vision by direct light; the second is the foundation of Catoptrics, or the theory of vision by reflected light. Diop¬ trics, or vision by refracted light, had not yet become an object of attention",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America
"Two other principles which Euclid adopted as postulates in his demonstrations, have not met with the same entire confirmation from ex¬ periment, and are indeed true only in certain cases, and not universally, as he supposed. The first of these is, that we judge of the magnitude of an object altogether by the magnitude of the optical angle, or the angle which it subtends at the eye. It is true that this angle is an import ¬ ant element in that judgment; and Euclid, by discovering this, came into the possession of a valuable truth; but by a species of sophistry, very congenial to the human mind, he extended the principle too far, and supposed it to be the only circumstance which determines our judgment of visible magnitude. It is, indeed, the only measure which we are furnished with directly by the eye itself; but there are few cases in which we form our estimate without first appeal¬ ing to the commentary afforded by the sensations of touch, or the corrections derived from our own motion","Euclid, Euclid",US,8,United States,North America
"Another principle, laid down by the same geo¬ meter, is in circumstances nearly similar to the preceding. According to it, the place of any point of an object seen by reflection is always the intersection of the reflected ray, with the per¬ pendicular drawn from that point to the reflect¬ ing surface. The proof offered is obscure and defective; the proposition, however, is true, of plain speculums always, and of spherical as far as Euclid’s investigations extended, that is, while the rays fall on the speculum with no great ob¬ liquity. His assumption, therefore, did not af¬ fect the truth of his conclusions, though it would have been a very unsafe guide in more general investigations. The book is in many other re¬ spects imperfect, the reasoning often unsound, and the whole hardly worthy of the great geo¬ meter whose name it bears. There is, however, no doubt that Euclid wrote on the subject of op¬ tics, and many have supposed that this treatise is a careless extract, or an unskilful abridgement of the original work","Euclid, Euclid",US,8,United States,North America
"This treatise, though known in the middle ages, and quoted by Roger Bacon, had disappeared, and was supposed to be entirely lost, till within these few years, when a manuscript on optics, professing to be the work of Ptolemy, and to be translated from the Arabic, was found in the King’s Library at Paris. The most valuable part of this work is that which relates to refrac¬ tion, from whence it appears that many experi¬ ments had been made on that subject, and the angles of incidence and refraction, for different transparent substances, observed with so much accuracy, that the same ratio, very nearly, of the sines of these angles, from air into water or into glass, is obtained from Ptolemy’s numbers, which the repeated experiments of later times have shown to be true. The work, however, in the state in which it now appears, is very obscure, the reasoning often deficient in accuracy, and the mathematical part much less perfect than might have been expected. Modern writers, presum¬ ing partly on the reputation of Ptolemy, and partly guided by the authority of Roger Bacon, had ascribed to this treatise more merit than it appears to possess; and, of consequence, had allowed less to the Arabian author Alhazen, who comes next in the order of time, than of right belongs to him.

The author holds the opinion, that vision is performed by the emission of something from the eyes; and the reason which he assigns is, that the eyes are convex, and more adapted to emit than to receive. His metaphysics may be judged of from this specimen. He has not been made mention of by any ancient author, and the time when he wrote is unknown.

"How grievous it is to observe the head of the Christian church in that and the succeeding age, like the Anarch old in Milton, reigning in the midst of darkness, and complaining of the en¬ croachments which the realm of light was con¬ tinually making on his ancient empire ! The constitution of the eye, and the functions of the different parts of which it consists, were not yet fully understood.

"raised or depressed. From comparing all the circumstances, he perceived that the rays had entered the bottle, and that, after two refractions from the convex part, and a reflection from the concave, they were returned to the eye tinged with different colours, according to the angle at which the ray had entered. The rays that gave the same colour made the same angle with the surface, and hence all the drops that gave the same colour must he arranged in a circle, the centre of which was the point in the cloud op¬ posite to the sun. This, though not a complete theory of the rainbow, and though it left a great deal to occupy the attention, first of Descartes, and afterwards of Newton, was perfectly just, and carried the explanation as far as the prin¬ ciples then understood allowed it to go. The discovery itself may he considered as an ano¬ maly in science, as it is one of a very refined and subtile nature, made by a man who has given no other indication of much scientific sa¬ gacity or acuteness. In many things his writings show great ignorance of principles of optics well known in his own time; so that Boscovich, an excellent judge in such matters, has said of him, “ homo opticarum rerum, supra id quod patiatur ea setas, imperitissimus.” The hook con¬ taining this discovery was published in 1611.1 A discovery of the same period, hut somewhat earlier, will always he considered as among the most remarkable in the whole circle of human knowledge. It is the invention of the telescope, the work in which (by following unconsciously the plan of nature in the formation of the eye) man has come the nearest to the construction of a new organ of sense. For this great invention, in its original form, we are indebted to accident, or to the trials of men who had little knowledge of the principles of the science on which they were conferring so great a favour. A series of scientific improvements, continued for more than two hundred years, has continually added to the perfection of this noble instrument, and has almost entitled science to consider the tele¬ scope as its own production",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Descartes gave also a full explanation of the rainbow, • as far as colour was not concerned; a part of the problem which remained for Newton to resolve. The path of the ray was traced, and the angles of the incident ray, with that which emerges after two refractions and one reflec¬ tion, were accurately determined. Descartes paid little attention to those who had gone before him, and, as already remarked, never once mentioned the archbishop of Spalatro. Like Aristotle, he seems to have formed the design of cutting off the memory of all his predecessors; but the in¬ vention of printing had made this a far more hopeless undertaking than it was in the days of the Greek philosopher",Newton,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"After the publication of the Dioptrics of Des¬ cartes, in 1637, a considerable interval took place, during which optics, and indeed science in general, made hut little progress, till the Op¬ tica Promota of James Gregory, in 1663, seemed to put them again in motion. The author of this work, a profound and inventive geometer, had applied diligently to the study of optics and the improvement of optical instruments. The Optica Promota embraced several new inquiries concerning the illumination and distinctness of the images formed in the foci of lenses, and contained an account of the reflecting telescope, still known by the name of its author. The consideration which suggested this instrument was the imperfection of the images formed by spherical lenses, in consequence of which, they are not in plane, hut in curved surfaces. The desire of removing this imperfection led Gregory to substitute reflection for refraction in the con¬ struction of telescopes; and by this means, while he was seeking to remedy a small evil, he pro¬ vided the means of avoiding a much greater one, with which he was not yet acquainted, viz. that which arises from the unequal refrangibility of light. The attention of Newton was about the same time drawn to the same subject, hut with a perfect knowledge of the defect which he wanted to remove. Gregory thought it neces¬ sary that the specula should be of a parabolic figure; and the execution proved so difficult, that the instrument, during his own life, was never brought to any perfection. The specula were afterwards constructed of the ordinary spherical form, and the Gregorian telescope, till the time of Dr Herschel, was more in use than the Newtonian",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Cambridge in 1668, by Dr Barrow, and pub¬ lished in the year following, treated of all the more difficult questions which had occurred in that state of the science, with the acuteness and depth which are found in all the writings of that geometer.

It is writ¬ ten with great perspicuity and precision, and is said to have been a favourite book with Newton himself. Though beginning from the first ele¬ ments, it contains a full development of the matters of greatest difficulty in the construction of telescopes, particularly in what concerns the indistinctness arising from the imperfect foci into which rays are united by spherical lenses ; and rules are deduced for constructing tele¬ scopes, which, though of different sizes, shall have the same degree of distinctness, illumina¬ tion, &c. Huygens was, besides, a practical op¬ tician ; he polished lenses and constructed tele¬ scopes with his own hands, and some of his ob¬ ject-glasses were of the enormous focal distance of ISO feet.

"In the history of optics, particular attention is due to his theory of light, which was first communicated to the Academy of Sciences of Paris, in 1678, and afterwards published, with enlargements, in 1690.8 Light, according to this ingenious system, consists in certain undulations communicated by luminous bodies to the ethereal fluid which fills all space. This fluid is composed of the most subtile matter, is highly elastic, and the undulations are propagated through it with great velocity in spherical superficies proceeding from a centre. Light, in this view of it, differs from that of the Cartesian system, which is supposed to be without elasticity, and to convey impres¬ sions instantaneously, as a staff does from the object it touches to the hand which holds it",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"Were the history of any particular science to be continued for the whole of the busy interval which this second part embraces, it would leave the other sciences too far behind, and would make it difficult to perceive the mutual action by which they have so much assisted the pro¬ gress of one another. Considering some sort of subdivision, therefore, as necessary, and observ¬ ing, in the interval which extends from the first of Newton’s discoveries to the year 1818, three different conditions of the Physico-Mathematical sciences, well marked and distinguished by great improvements, I have divided the above interval into three corresponding parts. The first of these, reaching from the commencement of New¬ ton’s discoveries in 1663, to a little beyond his death, or to 1730, may be denominated, from the men who impressed on it its peculiar charac¬ ter, the period of Newton and Leibnitz. The second, which, for a similar reason, I call that of Euler and D’Alembert, may be regarded as extending from 1730 to 1780; and the third, that of Lagrange and Laplace, from 1780 to 1818","Newton, Newton, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"Beyond this point, neither his researches nor those of any other geometer had yet reached, and from this point the discoveries of Newton began. The Savilian professor had himself been extremely desirous to advance into the new re¬ gion, where, among other great objects, the quad¬ rature of the circle must necessarily he contain¬ ed ; and he made a very noble effort to pass the barrier by which the undiscovered country ap¬ peared to he defended. He saw plainly, that if the equations of the curves which he had squar¬ ed were ranged in a regular series, from the simpler to the more complex, their areas would constitute another corresponding series, the terms of which were all known. He further re¬ marked, that, in the first of these series, the equation to the circle itself might he introduced, and would occupy the middle place between the first and second terms of the series, or between an equation to a straight line and an equation to the common parabola. He concluded therefore, that if, in the second series, he could interpolate a term in the middle, between its first and se¬ cond terms, this term must necessarily he no other than the area of the circle. But when he proceeded to pursue this very refined and phi¬ losophical idea, he was not so fortunate; and his attempt toward the requisite interpolation, though it did not entirely fail, and made known a curious property of the area of the circle, did not lead to an indefinite quadrature of that curve.8 Newton was much more judicious and successful in his attempt. Proceeding on the same general principle with Wallis, as he him¬ self tells us, the simple view which he took of the areas already computed, and of the terms of which each consisted, enabled him to discover the law which was common to them all, and under which the expression for the area of the circle, as well as of innumerable other curves, must needs he comprehended. In the case of the circle, as in all those where a fractional exponent ap¬ peared, the area was exhibited in the form of an infinite series","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"The problem of the quadrature of the circle, and of so many other curves, being thus resolv¬ ed, Newton immediately remarked, that the law of these series was, with a small alteration, the law for the series of terms which expresses the root of any binomial quantity whatsoever. Thus he was put in possession of another valuable dis¬ covery, the Binomial Theorem, and at the same time perceived that this last was in reality, in the order of things, placed before the other, and afforded a much easier access to such quadratures than the method of interpolation, which, though the first road, appeared now neither to be the easiest nor the most direct",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"He has assured us himself, however, that the great principle of the new geometry was known to him, and applied to investigation, as early as 1665 or 1666.^ Independently of that authori¬ ty, we also know, on the testimony of Barrow, that soon after the period j ust mentioned there was put into his hands by Newton a manuscript treatise,3 the same which was afterwards pub¬ lished under the title of Analysis per JEqna- tiones Numero Terminorwn Infinitas, in which, though the instrument of investigation is no¬ thing else than infinite series, the principle of fluxions, if not fully explained, is at least dis¬ tinctly pointed out. Barrow strongly exhorted his young friend to publish this treasure to the world; hut the modesty of the author, of which the excess, if not culpable, was certainly in the present instance very unfortunate, prevented his compliance. All this was previous to the year 1669; the treatise itself was not published till 1711, more than forty years after it was written",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"For a long time, therefore, the discoveries of Newton were only known to his friends; and the first work in which he communicated any thing to the world on the subject of fluxions was in the first edition of the Principia^ in 1687, in the second Lemma of the second book, to which, in the disputes that have since arisen about the invention of the new analysis, reference has been so often made. The principle of the fluxionary calculus was there pointed out, but nothing ap¬ peared that indicated the peculiar algorithm, or the new notation, which is so essential to that calculus. About this Newton had yet given no information; and it was only from the second volume of Wallis’s Works, in 1693, that it be¬ came known to the world.4 It was no less than ten years after this, in 1704, that Newton him¬ self first published a work on the new calculus, his Quadrature of Curves, more than twenty- ei^1f years after it was written","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America

"the study of that science, he was soon m a con¬ dition to make new discoveries. He invented a method of squaring the circle, by transforming it into another curve of an equal area, but hav¬ ing the ordinate expressed by a rational fraction of the absciss, so that its area could be found by the methods already known. In this way he discovered the series, so remarkable for its sim¬ plicity, which gives the value of a circular arch in terms of the tangent. This series he com¬ municated to Oldenburg in 1674, and received from him in return an account of the progress made by Newton and Gregory in the invention of series. In 1676, Newton described his me¬ thod of quadratures at the request of Olden¬ burg, in order that it might be transmitted to Leibnitz, in the two letters already mentioned, as of such value, by recording the views which guided that great geometer in his earliest, and some of his most important discoveries. The method of fluxions is not communicated in these letters; nor are the principles of it in any way suggested; though there are, in the last letter, two sentences in transposed characters, which ascertain that Newton was then in possession of that method, and employed in speaking of it the same language in which it was afterwards made known. In the following year, Leibnitz, in a letter to Oldenburg, introduces differentials, and the methods of his calculus, for the first time.

"In what manner Newton’s communications in the two letters already referred to may have acted in stimulating the curiosity, and extending, or even directing, the views of such a man as Leibnitz, I shall not presume to decide (nor, even if such effect be admitted, will it take from the originality of his discoveries); but, that in the authenticated communications which took place between these philosophers there was no¬ thing which could make known the nature of the fluxionary calculus, I consider as a fact most fully established",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Of the new or infinitesimal analysis, we are, therefore, to consider Newton as the first inventor, Leibnitz as the second; his disco¬ very, though posterior in time, having heen made independently of the other, and having no less claim to originality. It had the advantage also of being first made known to the world; an account of it, and of its peculiar algorithm, having been inserted in the first volume of the ylcta Eniditorim, in 1684. Thus, while New¬ ton’s discovery remained a secret, communicated only to a few friends, the geometry of Leibnitz was spreading with great rapidity over the Con¬ tinent. Two most able coadjutors, the brothers James and John Bernoulli, joined their talents to those of the original inventor, and illustrated the new methods by the solution of a great Ara- riety of difficult and interesting problems. The reserve of Newton still kept his countrymen ig¬ norant of his geometrical discoveries; and the first book that appeared in England on the new geometry was that of Craig, who professedly derived his knowledge from the writings of Leibnitz and his friends. Nothing, however, like rivalship or hostility between these inventors had yet appeared; each seemed willing to admit the originality of the other’s discoveries; and Newton, in the passage of the Principia just re¬ ferred to, gave a highly favourable opinion on the subject of the discoveries of Leibnitz","Of, Newton, Newton, Newton","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"With the English was conviction, and, as we have seen, a well-grounded conviction, that the first discovery of the infinitesimal analysis was the property of Newton; but the analysis thus discovered was yet unknown to the pub¬ lic, and was in the hands of the inventor and his friends. With the Germans there was the conviction, also well founded, that the invention of their countryman was perfectly original; and they had the satisfaction to see his calculus everywhere adopted, and himself considered all over the Continent as the sole inventor. The friends of Newton could not but resist this latter claim; and the friends of Leibnitz, seeing that their master had become the great teacher of the new calculus, could not easily bring them¬ selves to acknowledge that he was not the first discoverer. The tranquillity that existed under such circumstances, if once disturbed, was not likely to be speedily restored","Newton, Newton","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"In a paper on the line of swiftest descent, which he presented to the Royal Society in 1699, was this sentence: “ I hold Newton to have been the first inventor of this calculus, and the earliest, by several years, induced by the evidence of facts; and whether Leibnitz, the second in¬ ventor, has borrowed any thing from the other, I leave to the judgment of those who have seen the letters and manuscripts of Newton.” Leib¬ nitz replied to this charge in the Leipsic Journal, without any asperity, simply stating himself to have been, as well as Newton, the inventor; neither contesting nor acknowledging Newton’s claim to priority, but asserting his own to the first publication of the calculus","Newton, Newton, Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Not long after this, the publication of New¬ ton s Quadrature of Curves, and his Enumeration of the lines of the third order, (1705) afforded the same journalists an opportunity of showing their determination to retort the insinuations of Du¬ illier, and to carry the war into the country of the enemy. After giving a very imperfect synopsis of the first of these books, they add : “ Ero differentiis igitur Leihnitianis D. Neictonus adhibet, semperque adhibuit, fiuxiones; quce sunt quamproxime utfluentium augmenta, cequalibus tem- porisparticulis quam minimis genita; Usque, turn in suis Principiis Naturce Mathematicis, turn in aliis postea editis, eleganter est usus; que.madmodum Honoratus Fabrius in sua Synopsi Geometrica motuum progressus Cavalierianai methodo substi- tuit.”1 In spite of the politeness and ambiguity of tbis passage, the most obvious meaning appeared to be, that Newton had been led to the notion of fluxions by the differentials of Leibnitz, just as Honoratus Fabri had been led to substitute lhe idea ot progressive motion for the indivisibles of Cavalieri. A charge so entirely unfounded, so inconsistent with acknowledged facts, and so little consonant to declarations that had former¬ ly come from the same quarter, could not but call forth the indignation of Newton and his friends, especially as it was known that these journalists spoke the language of Leibnitz and Bernoulli. In that indignation they were per¬ fectly justified; but when the minds of con¬ tending parties have become irritated in a cer¬ tain degree, it often happens that the injustice of one side is retaliated by an equal injustice from the opposite. Accordingly, Keili, who, with more zeal than judgment, undertook the defence of Newton’s claims, instead of endea¬ vouring to establish the priority of his disco¬ veries by an appeal to facts and to dates that could be accurately ascertained, (in which he would have been completely successful) under¬ took to prove, that the communications of New¬ ton to Leibnitz were sufficient to put the latter in possession of the principles of the new ana¬ lysis, after which he had only to substitute the notion of differentials for that of fluxions. In support of a charge which it would have re¬ quired the clearest and most irresistible evidence to justify, he had, however, nothing to offer but equivocal facts and overstrained arguments, such as could only convince those who were al- 1 Cammercium Ejnstolicum, No. 79: Newtoni Oj>cra, tom. IV. p. 577","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Leibnitz complained of Keill’s proceeding to the Royal Society of London, which declined giving judgment, but appointed a commission of its members to draw up a full and detailed le- port of all the communications which had passed between Newton and Leibnitz, or their friends, on subjects connected with the new analysis, from the time of Collins and Oldenburg to the date of Keill’s letter to Sir Hans Sloane in 1711, the same that was now complained of. This re¬ port forms what is called the Commercium Epis- iolicum ; it was published by order of the Royal Society the year following, and contains an ac¬ count of the facts, which, though in the main fair and just, does not give that impression of the impartiality of the reporters which the cir¬ cumstances so imperiously demanded. Leib¬ nitz complained of this publication, and al¬ leged, that though nothing might be inserted that was not contained in the original letters, yet certain passages were suppressed which were favourable to his pretensions. He threatened an answer, which, however, never appeared","London, Newton, Oldenburg","GB,US,DE",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Germany","Europe,North America,Europe"
"The friends of Leibnitz hurt their own cause, by attempting to fix on Newton a charge of pla¬ giarism, which was refuted by such a chain of evidence, by so many dates distinctly ascertain¬ ed, and so many concessions of their own. A candid review of the evidence led to the con¬ viction, that both Newton and Leibnitz were original inventors. When the English mathe¬ maticians accused Leibnitz of borrowing from Newton, they were, therefore, going much far¬ ther than the evidence authorized them, and were mistaking their own partialities for proofs","Newton, Newton, Newton","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"They maintained what was not true, but what, nevertheless, was not physically impossible, the discovery of Newton being certainly prior to that of Leibnitz. The German mathematicians, on the other hand, when they charged Newton with borrowing from Leibnitz, were maintaining what was not only false, but what involved an impos¬ sibility. This is the only part of the dispute, in which any thing that could be construed into mala fldes can be said to have appeared. I am far, however, from giving it that construction; men of such high character, both for integrity and talents, as Leibnitz and Bernoulli, ought not to be lightly subjected to so cruel an impu¬ tation. Partiality, prejudice, and passion, are sufficient to account for much injustice, without a decided intention to do wrong","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Though a straight line be the shortest distance between two points, it does not necessarily fol¬ low that the descent in that line will be most speedily performed; for, by falling in a curve that has at first a very rapid declivity, the body may acquire in the beginning of its motion so great a velocity, as shall carry it over a long line in less time than it would describe a short one, with a velocity more slowly acquired. This, however, is a problem that belongs to a class of questions of peculiar difficulty; and accordingly it was resolved only by a few of the most dis¬ tinguished mathematicians.

The curve that has the property required is the cycloid: Newton has given the construction, but has not accompanied it with the analysis","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"The problem of orthogonal trajectories, as it is called, had been long ago proposed in the Acta Eruditorum, with an invitation to all who were skilled in the new analysis to attempt the solu¬ tion. The problem had not, at first, met with the attention it was supposed to deserve; but John Bernoulli, having resumed the considera¬ tion of it, found out what appeared a very per¬ fect and very general solution; and the question was then (1716) proposed anew by Leibnitz, for the avowed purpose of trying the skill of the English mathematicians. The question is,—a system of curves described according to a known law being given, (all the hyperbolas, for instance, that are described between the same assymp- totes, or all the parabolas that have the same directrix, and that pass through the same point, &c.) to describe a curve which shall cut them all at right angles. This may be considered as the first defiance professedly aimed at the Eng¬ lish mathematicians. The problem was delivered to Newton on his return from the Mint, when he was much fatigued with the business of the day : he resolved it, however, the same evening; and his solution, though without a name, is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1716.1 This solution, however, only gave rise to new quarrels; for hardly any thing so excellent could come from the one side, that it could meet with the entire approbation of the other. Newton’s, indeed, was rather the plan or projet of an in¬ vestigation, than an actual solution; and, in the general view which it took of the question, could hardly provide against all the difficulties that might occur in the application to particular cases. This was what Bernoulli objected to, and affected to treat the solution as of no value","Newton, Newton","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"Brook Taylor, Secretary of the Royal Society, and well known as one of the ablest geometers of the time, undertook the defence of it, but concluded with using language very reprehen¬ sible, and highly improper to be directed by one man of science against another. Having suffi¬ ciently, as he supposed, replied to Bernoulli and his friends, he adds, “ if they are not satis¬ fied with the solution, it must be ascribed to their own ignorance.”'* It strongly marks the temper by which both sides were now animated, when a man like Taylor, eminent for profound 1 Vol. XXIX. p. 399",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America
"science, and, in general, very much disposed to do justice to the merits of others, should so for¬ get himself as to reproach with ignorance of the calculus one of the men who understood it the best, and who had contributed the most to its improvement. The irritability and prejudices of Bernoulli admitted of no defence, and he might very well have been accused of viewing the so¬ lution of Newton through a medium disturbed by their action; but to suppose that he was un¬ able to understand it, was an impertinence that could only react on the person who was guilty of it. Bernoulli was not exemplary for his pa¬ tience ; and it will be readily believed, that the incivility of Taylor was sufficiently ie\engcd","Newton, Taylor",US,8,United States,North America
"Taylor not long after came forward with an open defiance to the whole Continent, and pro¬ posed a problem, Omnibus geometris non Anglis, —a problem, of course, which he supposed that the English mathematicians alone were suffi¬ ciently enlightened to resolve. He selected one, accordingly, of very considerable difficulty,— the integration of a fluxion of a complicated form; which, nevertheless, admitted of being done in a very elegant manner, known, I be¬ lieve, at that time to very few of the English mathematicians,—to Cotes, to himself, and per¬ haps one or two more. The selection, never¬ theless, was abundantly injudicious; for Ber¬ noulli, as long ago as 1'702, had explained the method of integrating this, and such like for¬ mulas, both in the Paris Memoires and in the Leipsic Ads. The question, accordingly, was no sooner proposed than it was answered in a manner the most clear and satisfactory; so the defiance of Taylor only served to display the address and augment the triumph of his adver¬ sary","Taylor, Taylor","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"The last and most unsuccessful of these chal¬ lenges was that of Keill, of whose former ap¬ pearance in this controversy we have already had so much more reason to commend the zeal than the discretion. Among the problems in the mixed mathematics which had excited most attention, and which seemed best calculated to exercise the resources of the new analysis, was the determination of the path of a projectile in a medium which resists proportionally to the square of the velocity, that being nearly the law of the resistance which the air opposes to bodies moving with great velocity. The resistance of fluids had been treated of by Newton in the second book of the Principia, and he had inves¬ tigated a great number of curious and import¬ ant propositions relative to its effects. He had considered some of the simpler laws of resist¬ ance; but of the case just mentioned he had given no solution, and, after approaching as near as possible to it on all sides, had with¬ drawn without making an attack. A problem so formidable was not likely to meet with many who, even in the more improved state at which the calculus had now arrived, could hope to overcome its difticulties. Whether Keill had flattered himself that he could resolve the pro¬ blem, or had forgotten, that when a man pro¬ poses a question of defiance to another, he ought to be sure that he can answer it himself, may be doubted; but this is certain, that, without the necessary preparation, he boldly challenged Bernoulli to produce a solution",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"When we attempt to trace those steps to their origin, we find the principle of the infinitesimal analysis making its first appearance in the me¬ thod of exhaustions, as exemplified in the writ¬ ings of Euclid and Archimedes. These geo¬ meters observed, and, for what we know, were the first to observe, that the approach which a rectilineal figure may make to one that is curvilineal, by the increase of the number of its sides, the diminution of their magnitude, and a certain enlargement of the angles they contain, may be such that the properties of the former shall coincide so nearly with those of the latter, that no real difference can be supposed between them without involving a contradiction; and it was in ascertaining the conditions of this ap¬ proach, and in showing the contradiction to be unavoidable, that the method of exhaustions consisted. The demonstrations were strictly geometrical, but they were often complicated, always indirect, and of course synthetical, so that they did not explain the means by which they had been discovered",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America
"But we must go back a step in point of time, if we would trace accurately the history of this last improvement. Descartes, as has been shown in the former part of this outline, made a great revolution in the mathematical sciences, by ap¬ plying algebra to the geometry of curves; or, more generally, by applying it to express the re¬ lations of variable quantity. This added in¬ finitely to the value of the algebraic analysis, and to the extent of its investigations. The same great mathematician had observed the ad¬ vantage that would be gained in the geometry of curves, by considering the variable quantities in one state of an equation as differing infinitely little from the corresponding quantities in an¬ other state of the same equation. By means grounded on this he had attempted to draw tan¬ gents to curves, and to determine their curva¬ ture ; but it is seldom the destination of nature that a new discovery should be begun and per¬ fected by the same individual; and, in these at¬ tempts, though Descartes did not entirely fail, he cannot be considered as having been suc¬ cessful.1 At last came the two discoverers, Newton and Leibnitz, who completely lifted up the veil which their predecessors had been endeavouring to draw aside. They plainly saw, as Descartes indeed had done in part, that the infinitely small vari¬ ations of the ordinate and absciss are closely con- 4 M DISS. IV., PART II",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"nected with many properties of the curve, which have hut a very remote dependence on the ordi¬ nates and abscissae themselves. Hence they in¬ ferred, that to obtain an equation expressing the relations of these variations to one another, was to possess the most direct access to the knowledge of those properties. They observed also, that when an equation of this kind was deduced from the general equation, it admitted of being brought to great simplicity, and of being resolved much more readily than the other. In effect, it assumed the form of a simple equation; hut, in order to make this deduction in the readiest and most distinct way, the introduction of new symbols, or of a new algorithm, was necessary, the invention of which could cost hut little to the creative genius of the men of whom I now speak. They appear, as has been already shown, to have made their dis¬ coveries separately;—Newton first,—Leibnitz afterwards, at a considerable interval, yet the earliest, by several years, in communicating his discoveries to the world",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus, though there had been for ages a gra¬ dual approach to the new analysis, there were in that progress some great and sudden advances which elevated those who made them to a much higher level than their predecessors. A great number of individuals co-operated in the work; hut those who seem essential, and in the direct line of advancement, are Euclid, Cavalieri, Des¬ cartes, Newton, and Leibnitz. If any of the others had been wanting, the world would have been deprived of many valuable theorems, and many collateral improvements, hut not of any general method essential to the completion of the infinitesimal analysis","Euclid, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Newton proceeded in some respects different¬ ly, and so as to preserve his calculus from the imputation of neglecting or throwing away any thing merely because it was small. Instead of the actual increments of the flowing or variable quantities, he introduced what he called the fluxions of those quantities,—meaning, by flux¬ ions, quantities which had to one another the same ratio which the increments had in their ul¬ timate or evanescent state. He did not reject quantities, therefore, merely because they were so small that he might do so without committing any sensible error, but because he must reject them, in order to commit no error whatsoever",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Fluxions were, with him, nothing else than mea¬ sures of the velocities with which variable or flowing quantities were supposed to be generated; and they might he of any magnitude, providing they were in the ratio of those velocities, or, which is the same, in the ratio of the nascent or evanescent increments.1 The fluxions, there¬ fore, and the flowing quantities or fluents of Newton, correspond to the differentials and the sums or integrals of Leibnitz; and though the symbols which denote fluxions are different from those used to express differentials, they answer 1 “ I consider mathematical quantities in this place, not as consisting of small parts, but as described by a continued mo¬ tion. Lines are described, and thereby generated, not by the apposition of parts, but by the continued motion of points; superficies by the motion of lines,” &c. {Quadrature of Curves, Introduction.) DISSERTATION FOURTH",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"view taken of it by Newton, is peculiarly ad¬ apted to physical researches, as the hypothesis of quantities being generated by continued mo¬ tion comes there to coincide exactly with the fact. The momentary increments or the fluxions represent so precisely the forces by which the changes in nature are produced, that this doc¬ trine seemed created for the express purpose of penetrating into the interior of things, and tak¬ ing direct cognizance of those animating powers which, by their suhtilty, not only elude the ob¬ servation of sense, hut the ordinary methods of geometrical investigation. The infinitesimal analysis alone affords the means of measuring forces, when each acts separately, and instan¬ taneously under conditions that can he accurate¬ ly ascertained. In comparing the effects of con¬ tinued action, the variety of time and circum¬ stance, and the continuance of effects after their causes have ceased, introduce so much uncer¬ tainty, that nothing hut vague and unsatisfac¬ tory conclusions can he deduced. The analysis of infinites goes directly to the point; it mea¬ sures the intensity or instantaneous effort of the force, and, of course, removes all those causes of uncertainty which prevailed when the results of continued action could alone be estimated. It is not even by the effects produced in a short time, but by effects taken in their nascent or evanescent state, that the true proportion of causes must be ascertained",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus, though the astronomers had proved that the planets describe ellipses round the sun as the common focus, and that the line from the sun to each planet sweeps over areas proportional to the time,—had not the geometer resolved the elliptic motion into its primary elements, and compared them in their state of evanescence, it would never have been discovered that these bodies gravitate to the sun with forces which are inversely as the square of their distances from the centre of that luminary. Thus, fortunately, the first discovery of Newton was the instrument which was to conduct him safely through all the intricacies of his future investigations",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"When such separation cannot be made, the problem is among the most difficult which the infinitesimal analysis presents, at the same time that it is the key to a vast number of interest¬ ing questions both in the pure and the mixed mathematics. The two Bernoullis applied them¬ selves strenuously to the elucidation of it; and to them we owe all the best and most accurate methods of resolving such questions which ap¬ peared in the early history of the calculus, and which laid the foundation of so many subse¬ quent discoveries. This is a fact which cannot be contested; and it must be acknowledged also, that on the same subject the writings of the English mathematicians were then, as they con¬ tinue to be at this day, extremely defective. New¬ ton, though he had treated of this branch of the infinitesimal analysis with his usual ingenuity and depth, had done so only in his work on Fluxions, which did not see the light till several years after his death, when, in 1736, it appear¬ ed in Colson’s Translation. But that work, even bad it come into the hands of the public in the author’s lifetime, would not have remedied the defect of which I now speak. When the fluxion¬ ary equation could not be integrated by the simplest and most elementary rules, Newton had always recourse to approximations by infinite series, in the contrivance of which he indeed displayed great ingenuity and address. But an approximation, let it be ever so good, and con¬ verge ever so rapidly, is always inferior to an accurate and complete solution, if this last pos¬ sess any tolerable degree of simplicity. The series which affords the approximation cannot converge always, or in all states of the variable quantity; and its utility, on that account, is so much limited, that it can hardly lead to any general result. Besides, it does not appear that these series can always be made to involve the arbitrary or indeterminate quantity, without which no fluent can be considered as complete",Newton,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"For these reasons, such approximations should never be resorted to till every expedient has been used to find an accurate solution. To this rule, however, Newton’s method does not con¬ form, but employs approximation in cases where the complete integral can be obtained. The tendency of that method, therefore, however great its merit in other respects, was to give a direction to research which was not always the best, and which, in many instances, made it fall entirely short of the object it ought to have at¬ tained. It is true that many fluxionary equa¬ tions cannot be integrated in any other way; but by having recourse to it indiscriminately, we overlook the cases in which the integral can be exactly assigned. Accordingly, Bernoulli, by following a different process, remarked entire classes of fluxionary or differential equations, that admitted of accurate integration. Thus he found, that differential equations, if homoge¬ neous, 1 however complicated, may always have the variable quantities separated, so as to come under one of the simpler forms already enume¬ rated. By the introduction, also, of exponential equations, which had been considered in England as of little use, he materially improved this branch of the calculus",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But we must now look at the original works of the earliest inventor. Newton, besides his letters published in the Commercium Epistolicum, is the author of three tracts on the new ana¬ lysis that have all been occasionally mentioned",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"None of them, however, appeared nearly so soon as a great number of the pieces which have just been enumerated. The Quadrature of Curves, 1 Nova Mr.tlwdus pro Maximis et Minimis, See. : Leibnitii Opera, tom. III. p. 167- 2 Those of James were published at Geneva in 1744 ; of John, at Lausanne and Geneva m 1742","Geneva, Lausanne, Geneva","US,CH",8,"United States,Switzerland","North America,Europe"
"Newton had a great fondness for the synthe¬ tical method, which is apparent even in the most analytical of his works. In his Fluxions, when he is treating of the quadrature of curves, he says, “ After the area of a curve has been found and constructed, we should consider about the demonstration of the construction, that, laying aside all algebraical calculation as much as may be, the theorem may be adorned and made ele¬ gant, so as to become fit for public view.”1 This is followed by two or three examples, in which the rule here given is very happily illus¬ trated. When the analysis of a problem re¬ quires, like the quadrature of curves, the use of the inverse method of fluxions, the reversion of that analysis, or the synthetical demonstration, must proceed by the direct method, and there¬ fore may admit of more simplicity than the others, so as, in the language of the above pas¬ sage, to be easily adorned and made elegant",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Of the works that appeared in the early stages of the calculus, none is more entitled to notice than the Flarmonia Mensurarum of Cotes. The idea of reducing the areas of curves to those of the circle and hyperbola, in those cases which did not admit of an accurate comparison with rectilineal spaces, had early occurred to Newton, and was very fully exemplified in his Quadra¬ ture of Curves. Cotes extended this method:— his work appeared in 1722, and gave the rules for finding the fluents of fractional expressions, whether rational or irrational, greatly general¬ ized and highly improved by means of a pro¬ perty of the circle discovered by himself, and justly reckoned among the most remarkable pro¬ positions in geometry. It is singular that a work so profound and so useful as the Flarmo¬ nia Mensurarum should never have acquired, even among the mathematicians of England, the popularity which it deserves; and that, on the Continent, it should be very little known, even after the excellent commentary and additions of Bishop Walmesley. The reasons perhaps are, that, in many parts, the work is obscure; that it does not explain the analysis which must have led to the formula contained in the tables; and 1 Newton’s Fluxions, Colson’s Translation, p. 116, sect. 107","Of, Newton, Newton","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"Taylor, however, was more remarkable for the ingenuity and depth, than for the perspi¬ cuity of his writings. Even a treatise on Per¬ spective, of which he is the author, though in other respects excellent, has always been com¬ plained of as obscure; and it is no wonder if, on a new subject, and one belonging to the higher geometry, his writings should be still more exposed to that reproach. This fault was removed, and the whole theory explained with great clearness, by M. Nicole, of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, in a series of Memoires from the year 1717 to 1727","Taylor, Paris",US,8,United States,North America
"A single analytical formula in the Method of Increments has conferred a celebrity on its au¬ thor, which the most voluminous works have not often been able to bestow. It is known by the name of Taylor’s Theorem, and expresses the value of any function of a variable quantity in terms of the successive orders of increments, whether finite or infinitely small. If any one proposition can be said to comprehend in it a whole science, it is this: for from it almost every truth and every method of the new ana¬ lysis may be deduced. It is difficult to say whether the theorem does most credit to the genius of the author, or the power of the lan¬ guage which is capable of concentrating such a vast body of knowledge in a single expression",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America

In this, our countrymen had fallen considerably behind, as has been al¬ ready explained; and the distance between them and their brethren on the Continent continued to increase, just in proportion to the number and importance of the questions, physical and mathematical, which were found to depend on these integrations. The habit of studying only our own authors on these subjects, produced at first by our admiration of Newton and our dis¬ like to his rivals, and increased by a circum¬ stance very insignificant in itself, the diversity of notation, prevented us from partaking in the pursuits of our neighbours, and cut us off in a great measure from the vast field in which the genius of France, of Germany, and Italy, was exercised with so much activity and success",Newton,"FR,DE,IT,US",8,"France,Germany,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"
"Soon after this, the calculus had to sustain an attack from two French academicians, which drew more attention than that of the Dutch naturalist. One of these, Rolle, was a mathe¬ matician of no inconsiderable acquirement, but 1 Republished Analysis Infimtorum at Amsterdam, in 1695; and another tract, Consider ationcs circa Calculi Differentialis j rineipia^ in the year following. This last was answered by Hermann",Amsterdam,"US,FR,NL",8,"United States,France,Netherlands","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The geometry of infinites had both these faults, and particularly the latter.” After all these disputes were quieted in France, and the new analysis appeared completely vic¬ torious, it had an attack to sustain in England from a more formidable quarter. Berkeley, bi¬ shop of Cloyne, wns a man of first-rate talents, distinguished as a metaphysician, a philosopher, and a divine. His geometrical knowledge, how¬ ever, which, for an attack on the method of fluxions, was more essential than all his other accomplishments, seems to have been little more than elementary. The motive which induced him to enter on discussions so remotely connect¬ ed with his usual pursuits, has been variously represented; but, whatever it was, it gave rise to the Analyst, in which the author professes to demonstrate, that the new analysis is inaccurate in its principles, and that if it ever lead to true conclusions, it is from an accidental compensa¬ tion of errors that cannot be supposed always to take place. The argument is ingeniously and plausibly conducted, and the author sometimes attempts ridicule with better success than could be expected from the subject: thus, when he calls ultimate ratios the ghosts of departed quan¬ tities, it is not easy to conceive a witty saying more happily fastened on a mere mathematical abstraction",Berkeley,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The Analyst was answered by Jurin, under the signature of Philalethes ; and to this Berke¬ ley replied in a tract entitled A Defence of Free- thinking in Mathematics. Replies were again made to this; so that the argument assumed the form of a regular controversy; in which, though the defenders of the calculus had the advantage, it must be acknowledged that they did not al¬ ways argue the matter quite fairly, nor exactly meet the reasoning of their adversary. The true answer to Berkeley was, that what he conceived to be an accidental compensation of errors was not at all accidental, but that the two sets of quantities that seemed to him neglected in the reasoning were in all cases necessarily equal, and an exact balance for one another. The New¬ tonian idea of a fluxion contained in it this truth, and so it was argued by Jurin and others, but not in a manner so logical and satisfactory as might have been expected. Perhaps it is not too much to assert, that this was not complete¬ ly done till Lagrange’s Theory of Functions ap¬ peared. Thus, if the author of the Analyst has had the misfortune to enrol his name on the side of error, he has also had the credit of pi’o- posing difficulties of which the complete solu¬ tion is only to be derived from the highest im¬ provements of the calculus",Berkeley,US,8,United States,North America

"The Principia Mathematica of Newton, pub¬ lished also in 1687, marks a great era in the history of human knowledge, and had the merit of effecting an almost entire revolution in me¬ chanics, by giving new powers and a new di¬ rection to its researches. In that work the com¬ position of forces was treated independently of the composition of motion, and the equilibrium of the lever was deduced from the former, as well as in the treatise already mentioned. From the equality of action and re-action it was also inferred, that the state of the centre of gravity of any system of bodies is not changed by the action of those bodies on one another. This is a great proposition in the mechanics of the universe, and is one of the steps by which that science ascends from the earth to the heavens; for it proves that the quantity of mo¬ tion existing in nature, when estimated in any one given direction, continues always of the same amount",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries were rendered illus¬ trious, as we have already seen, by the mathe¬ matical discoveries of two of the greatest men who have ever enlightened the world. A slight sketch of the improvements which the theory of mechanics owes to Newton has been just given; those which it owes to Leibnitz, though not equally important, nor equally numerous, are far too conspicuous to be passed over in silence",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"It was the usual error, however, of Leibnitz and his followers, to push the metaphysical prin¬ ciples of science into extreme cases, where they lead to conclusions to which it was hardly pos¬ sible to assent. The Academy of Sciences at Paris having proposed as a prize question the Investigation of the Laws of the Communication of Motion,3 John Bernoulli presented an Essay on the subject, very ingenious and profound; in which, however, he denied the existence of hard bodies, because, in the collision of such bodies, 1 The argument of Leibnitz seems evidently inconclusive. For, though there were two similar and equal atoms, yet as they could not co-exist in the same space, they would not, so far as position is concerned, bear the same relation to the par¬ ticles that surrounded them: there might exist, therefore, considering them as part of the materials to be employed in the construction of the universe, very good reasons for assigning different situations to each",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"No one indeed had ever thought of questioning the conformity of this measure to the phenomena of nature, when, in 1686, Leibnitz announced in the Leipsic Journal the demonstration of a great error committed by Descartes and others, in esti¬ mating the force of moving bodies. In this paper the author endeavoured to show, that the force of a moving body is not proportional to its velo¬ city simply, but to the square of its velocity; and he supported this new doctrine by very plausible reasoning. A body, he says, projected upward against gravity, with a double velocity, ascends to four times the height; with the triple veloci¬ ty, to nine times the height; and so on, the height ascended to being always as the square of the velocity. But the height ascended to is the effect, and is the natural measure of the force; therefore the force of a moving body is as the square of its velocity. Such was the first rea¬ soning of Leibnitz on this subject,—simple, and apparently conclusive; nor should it be forgotten that, during the long period to which the dis¬ pute was lengthened out, and notwithstanding the various shapes which it assumed, the reason¬ ings on his side were nothing more than this ori¬ ginal argument, changed in its form, or render¬ ed more complex by the combination of new circumstances, so as to be more bewildering to the imagination, and more difficult either to ap¬ prehend or to refute.1 John Bernoulli was at first of a different opinion from his friend and master, but came at length to adopt the same; which, however, ap¬ pears to have gone no farther till the discourse was submitted to the Academy of Sciences, as has been already mentioned. The mathematical world could not look with indifference on a question which seemed to affect the vitals of mechanical science, and soon separated into two parties, in the arrangement of which, however, the effects of national predilection might easily be discovered. Germany, Holland, and Italy, declared for the vis viva ; England stood firm for the old doctrine; and France was divided between the two opinions. No controversy, 1 To mere pressure Leibnitz gave the name of vis mortva. and to the force of moving bodies the name of vis viva. The former he admitted to be proportional to the simple power of the virtual velocity, and the second he held to be proportion* al to the square of the actual veloci ty",Holland,"DE,IT,FR,US",8,"Germany,Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"

"So far as general principles are concerned, the preceding are the chief mechanical improve¬ ments which belong to the period so honourably distinguished by the names of Newton and Leib¬ nitz. The application of these principles to the solution of particular problems would afford materials for more ample discussion than suits the nature of an historical outline. Such pro¬ blems as that of finding the centre of oscilla¬ tion,—the nature of the catenarian curve,—the determination of the line of swiftest descent,— the retardation produced to motion in a medium that resists according to the square of the velo¬ city, or indeed according to any function of it,—the determination of the elastic curve, or that into which an elastic spring forms itself when a force is applied to bend it;—all these were problems of the greatest interest, and were now resolved for the first time; the science of mechanics being sufficient, by means of the com¬ position of forces, to find out the fluxionary or differential equations which expressed the nature of the gradual changes which in all these cases were produced, and the calculus being now suffi¬ ciently powerful to infer the properties of the finite from those of the infinitesimal quantities",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The doctrine of Hydrostatics was cultivated in England by Cotes. The properties of the atmosphere, or of elastic fluids, were also ex¬ perimentally investigated; and the barometer, after the ingenuity of Pascal had proved that the mercury stood lower the higher up into the atmo¬ sphere the instrument was carried, was at length brought to he a measure of the height of moun¬ tains. Mariotte appears to have been the first who proposed this use of it, and who discovered that, while the height from the ground increases in arithmetical, the density of the atmosphere and the column of mercury in the barometer decrease in geometrical progression. Halley, who seems also to have come of himself to the same conclusion, proved its truth by strict geo¬ metrical reasoning, and showed that logarithms are easily applicable on this principle to the pro¬ blem of finding the height of mountains. This was in the year 1685. Newton two years after¬ wards gave a demonstration of the same, extend¬ ed to the case when gravity is not constant, hut varies as any power of the distance from a given centre",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"It was in this period also that electricity may be said first to have taken a scientific form. The power of amber to attract small bodies after it has been rubbed, is said to have been known to Thales, and is certainly made mention of by Theophrastus. The observations of Gilbert, a physician of Colchester, in the end of the six¬ teenth century, though at the distance of two thousand years, made the first addition to the transient and superficial remarks of the Greek naturalist, and afford a pretty full enumeration of the bodies which can be rendered electrical by friction. The Academia del Cimento, Boyle, and Otto Guericke, followed in the same course; and the latter is the first who mentions the crackling noise and faint light which electricity sometimes produced. These, however, were hardly perceived, and it was by Dr Wall, as described in the Philosophical Transactions, that they were first distinctly observed.1 By a sin¬ gularly fortunate anticipation, he remarks of the light and crackling, that they seemed in some degree to represent thunder and light¬ ning","Gilbert, Colchester","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"The experiments and inquiries of Newton on that subject began in 1666, and soon made a vast addition both to the extent and importance of the science. He was at that time little more than twenty-three years old; he had already made some of the greatest and most original discoveries in the pure mathematics; and the same young man, whom we have been admiring as the most profound and inventive of geome¬ ters, is to appear, almost at the same moment, as the most patient, faithful, and sagacious in¬ terpreter of nature. These characters, though certainly not opposed to one another, are not often combined; but to be combined in so high a degree, and in such early life, was hitherto without example",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Having admitted the light and applied a prism 1 Philosophical Transactions, vol. VI. (1672) p. 3075: also Hutton’s Abridgement, vol. I. p. 678. The account of the ex¬ periments is in a letter to Oldenburg, dated February 1672 : it is the first of Newton’s works that was published. It is plain, from what is said above, that the phenomena of the prismatic spectrum were not unknown at that time, however little they were understood, and however imperfectly observed","Oldenburg, Newton","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"The coloured light which passed through this second hole was made to fall on a prism, and afterwards received on the opposite wall. It was then found that the rays which had been most refracted, or most bent from their couise by the first prism, were most refracted also by the second, though no new colours were pro¬ duced. “ So,” says he, “ the true cause of the length of the image was detected to he no other than that light consists of rays differently re¬ frangible, which, without any respect to a dif¬ ference in their incidence, were, according to their degrees of refrangibility, transmitted to¬ wards divers parts of the wall.” 1 It was also observed, that when the rays which fell on the second prism were all of the same colour, the image formed by refraction was truly circular, and of the same colour with the incident light. This is one of the most con¬ clusive and satisfactory of all the experiments* When the sun’s light is thus admitted, first through one aperture, and then through another at some distance from the first, and is afterwards made to fall on a prism, as the rays come only from a part of the sun’s disk, the spectrum has nearly the same length as before, hut the breadth is greatly diminished; in consequence of which, the light at each point is purer, it is free from penumbra, and the confines of the different co¬ lours can be more accurately traced. It was in this way that Newton measured the extent of each colour; and taking the mean of a great number of measures, he assigned the following proportions, dividing the whole length of the spectrum, exclusive of its rounded terminations, into 360 equal parts: of these the Red occupied - - 45 Orange ^ - 27 Yellow - - - 48 Green - - 60 Blue - - - 60 Indigo - - 40 Violet - - - 80 Between the divisions of the spectrum, thus made by the different colours, and the divisions of the monochord by the notes of music, Newton conceived that there was an analogy, and indeed an identity of ratios; hut experience has since shown that this analogy was accidental, as the spaces occupied by the different colours do not divide the spectrum in the same ratio, when prisms of different kinds of glass are employed","Newton, Orange, Green, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Such were the experiments by which Newton first “ untwisted all the shining robe of day,” and made known the texture of the magic gar¬ ment which nature has so kindly spread over the surface of the visible world. From them it followed, that colours are not qualities which light derives from refraction or reflection, hut are original and connate properties connected with the different degrees of refrangihility that belong to the different rays. The same colour is always joined to the same degree of refrangi¬ bility ; and conversely, the same degree of re¬ frangibility to the same colour",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But the most surprising composition of all, Newton observes, is that of whiteness; which is not produced by one sort of rays, but by the mixture of all the colours in a certain propor¬ tion, namely, in that proportion which they have in the solar spectrum. This fact may be said to be made out both by analysis and com¬ position. The white light of the sun can be se¬ parated, as we have just seen, into the seven simple colours; and if these colours be united again, they form white. Should any of them have been wanting, or not in its due proportion, the white produced is defective",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"It appeared, too, that natural bodies, of what¬ ever colour, if viewed by simple and homogene¬ ous light, are seen of the colour of that light, and of no other. Newton tried this very satisfac- 1 Philosophical Transactions, vol. VI. (1072) No. SO. p. 3075",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Newton, thus furnished with so many new and accurate notions concerning the nature and production of colour, proceeded to apply them to the explanation of phenomena. The subject which naturally offered itself the first to this analysis was the rainbow, which, by the grandeur and simplicity of its figure, added to the brilli¬ ancy of its colours, in every age has equally at¬ tracted the attention of the peasant and of the philosopher. That two refractions and one re¬ flection were at least a part of the machinery which nature employed in the construction of this splendid arch, had been known from the time of Antonio de Dominis; and the manner in which the arched figure is produced had been shown by Descartes; so that it only remained to explain the nature of the colour and its dis¬ tribution. As the colours were the same with those exhibited by the prism, and succeeded in the same order, it could hardly be doubted that the cause was the same. Newton showed the truth of his principles by calculating the extent of the arch, the breadth of the coloured bow, the position of the secondary bow, its distance from the primary, and by explaining the inversion of the colours.1 There is not, perhaps, in science any happier application of theory, or any in which the mind rests with fuller confidence","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Transparent bodies, particularly fluids, often transmit light of one colour and reflect light of another. Halley told Newton, that, being deep under the surface of the sea in a diving-bell, in a clear sunshine day, the upper side of his hand, on which the sun shone darkly through the water and through a small glass window in the diving-bell, appeared of a red colour, like a da¬ mask rose, while the water below, and the under part of his hand, looked green.2 But, in explaining the permanent colour of bodies, this difficulty always presents itself:— Suppose that a body reflects red or green light, what is it that decomposes the light, and sepa¬ rates the red or the green from the rest ? Re¬ fraction is the only means of decomposing light, and separating the rays of one degree of refran- gibility, and of one colour, from those of ano¬ ther. This appears to have been what led New¬ ton to study the colours produced by light pass¬ ing through thin plates of any transparent sub¬ stance. The appearances are very remarkable, and had already attracted the attention both of Boyle and of Hooke ; but the facts observed by them remained insulated in their hands, and un¬ connected with other optical phenomena",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In order to analyze a phenomenon that seemed in itself not a little curious, Newton proposed to make the experiment with surfaces of a regular 1 Optics, book i. part ii. prop. 9",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The colours of these rings were so marked by peculiarities in shade and vivacity, that Newton considered them as belonging to different orders; so that an eye accustomed to examine them, on any particular colour of a natural object being pointed out, would be able to determine to what order in this series it belonged",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus we have a system of rings or zones sur¬ rounding a dark central spot, and themselves alternately dark and coloured, that is, alternate¬ ly transmitting the light and reflecting it. It is evident that the thickness of the plates of air in¬ terposed between the glasses, at each of those rings, must be a very material element in the arrangement of this system. Newton therefore undertook to compute their thickness. Having carefully measured the diameters of the first six coloured rings, at the most lucid part of each, he found their squares to be as the progression of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. The squares of the distances from the centre of the dark spot to each of these circumferences were, therefore, in the same ratio, and consequently the thickness of the plates of air, or the intervals between the glasses, was as the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Light penetrating a thin transparent plate, of which the thickness was 3m, 5m, &c. was de¬ composed and reflected; the same light penetrat¬ ing the same plate, but of the thickness 0, 2m, 4m, was transmitted, though, in a certain degree, also decomposed. The same light, therefore, was transmitted or reflected, according as the second surface of the plate of air through which it passed was distant from the first by the inter¬ vals 0, 2, 4m, or m, 3m, 5m ; so that it becomes necessary to suppose the same ray to he succes¬ sively disposed to he transmitted and to he re¬ flected at points of space separated from one another by the same interval m. This constitutes what Newton called Jits of easy transmission and easy reflection, and forms one of the most singu¬ lar parts of his optical discoveries. It is so un¬ like any thing which analogy teaches us to ex¬ pect, that it has often been viewed with a degree of incredulity, and regarded as at best but a con¬ jecture introduced to account for certain optical DISS.

"phenomena. This, however, is by no means a just conclusion ; for it is, in reality, a necessary inference from appearances accurately observed, and is no less entitled to he considered as a fact than those appearances themselves. The diffi¬ culty of assigning a cause for such extraordinary alternations cannot be denied, hut does not entitle us to doubt the truth of a conclusion fairly de¬ duced from experiment. The principle has been confirmed by phenomena that were unknown to Newton himself, and possesses this great and unequivocal character of philosophic truth, that it has served to explain appearances which were not observed till long after the time when it first became known",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"We cannot follow the researches of Newton into what regards the colours of thick plates, and of bodies in general. We must not, how¬ ever, pass over his explanation of refraction, which is among the happiest to be met with in any part of science, and has the merit of con¬ necting the principles of optics with those of dynamics",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The explanation of the law of refraction thus given is so highly satisfactory, that it affords a strong argument in favour of the system which considers light as an emanation of particles from luminous bodies, rather than the vibrations of an elastic fluid. It is true that Huygens de¬ duced from this last hypothesis an explanation of the law of refraction, on which considerable praise was bestowed in the former part of this Dissertation. It is undoubtedly very ingenious, but does not rest on the same solid and un¬ doubted principles of dynamics with the pre¬ ceding, nor does it leave the mind so completely satisfied. Newton, in his Principia, has deduced another demonstration of the same optical pro¬ position from the theory of central forces.2 The different refrangihility of the rays of light forms no exception to the reasoning above",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Light, in consequence of these views, became, in the hands of Newton, the means of making important discoveries concerning the internal and chemical constitution of bodies. The square that is added to that of the perpendicular velo¬ city of light in consequence of the attractive force of the transparent substance, is properly the measure of the quantity of that attraction, and is the same with the difference of the squares of the velocities of the incident and the refracted light. This is readily deduced, therefore, from the ratio of the angle of incidence to that of re¬ fraction ; and when this is done for different substances, it is found that the above measure of the refracting power of transparent bodies is nearly proportional to their density, with the exception of those which contain much inflam¬ mable matter in their composition, or sulphur as it Avas then called, which is always accompanied with an increase of refracting power.5 Thus, the refracting power, ascertained as above, when divided by the density, gives quo¬ tients not Arery different from one another, till we come to the inflammable bodies, where a great increase immediately takes place. In air, for instance, the quotient is 5208, in rock-crys¬ tal 5450, and the same nearly in common glass",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But in spirit of Avine, oil, amber, the same quotients are 10121, 12607, 13654. Newton found in the diamond, that this quotient is still greater than any of the preceding, being 14556.4 Hence he conjectured, what has since been so fully verified by experiment, that the diamond, at least in part, is an inflammable body. Ob¬ serving, also, that the refracting power of water is great for its density, the quotient, expounding it as above, being 7845, he concluded, that an inflammable substance enters into the composi¬ tion of that fluid,—a conclusion which has been confirmed by one of the most certain hut most unexpected results of chemical analysis. The views thus suggested by Newton have been suc¬ cessfully pursued by future inquirers, and the action of bodies on light is now regarded as one of the means of examining into their internal constitution","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America

"Huygens, writing to one of his friends, says of them, and of the truths they were the means of making known, <c Quorum respectu omnia hue usque edita jejunia sunt et prorsus puerilia.” Such were the sentiments of the person who, of all men living, was the best able to judge, and had the best right to be fastidious, in what related to optical experiments and discoveries. But all were not equally candid with the Dutch philo¬ sopher ; and though the discovery now commu¬ nicated had every thing to recommend it which can arise from what is great, new, and singu¬ lar ; though it was not a theory or a system of opinions, but the generalization of facts made known by experiments; and though it was brought forward in the most simple and unpre¬ tending form, a host of enemies appeared, each eager to obtain the unfortunate pre-eminence of being the first to attack conclusions which the unanimous voice of posterity was to con¬ firm. In this contention, the envy and activity of Hooke did not fail to give him the advantage; and he communicated his objections to Newton’s conclusions concerning the refrangibility of light in less than a month after they had been read in the Royal Society. He admitted the accuracy of the experiments themselves, but denied that the cause of the colour is any quality residing permanently in the rays of light, any more than that the sounds emitted from the pipes of an or¬ gan exist originally in the air. An imaginary analogy between sound and light seems to have been the basis of all his optical theories. He conceived that colour is nothing but the dis¬ turbance of light by pulses propagated through it; that blackness proceeds from the scarcity, whiteness from the plenty, of undisturbed light ; and that the prism acts by exciting different pulses in this fluid, which pulses give rise to the sensations of colour. This obscure and unin¬ telligible theory (if we may honour what is un¬ intelligible with the name of a theory) he ac¬ companied with a multitude of captious objec¬ tions to the reasonings of Newton, whom he was not ashamed to charge with borrowing from him without acknowledgement. To all this Newton replied, with the solidity, calmness, and modes¬ ty, which became the understanding and the temper of a true philosopher","Newton, Newton, Newton","US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"The new theory of colours was quickly as¬ sailed by several other writers, who seem all to have had a better apology than Hooke for the errors into which they fell. Among them one of the first was Father Pardies, who wrote against the experiments, and what he was pleased to call the hypothesis, of Newton. A satisfac¬ tory and calm reply convinced him of his mis¬ take, which he had the candour very readily to acknowledge. A countryman of his, Mariotte, was more difficult to be reconciled, and, though very conversant with experiment, appears never to have succeeded in repeating the experiments of Newton. Desaguliers, at the request of the latter, repeated the experiments doubted of be¬ fore the Royal Society, where Monmort, a coun¬ tryman and a friend of Mariotte, was present.1 MM.

"ed to Newton’s experiments as inaccurate; tlie first, because, on attempting to repeat them, be had not obtained the same results; and the se¬ cond, because he had not been able to perceive that a red object and a blue required the focal distance to be different when they were viewed through a telescope. Newton replied with great patience and good temper to both","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Newton was now no more; but Desaguliers, in consequence of Rizetti’sdoubts, instituteda series of experiments which seemed to set the matter entirely at rest. These experiments are de¬ scribed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1728",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"An inference which Newton had immediately drawn from the discoveries above described was, that the great source of imperfection in the re¬ fracting telescope was the different refrangibility of the rays of light, and that there were stronger reasons than either Mersenne or Gregory had suspected, for looking to reflection for the im¬ provement of optical instruments. It was evi¬ dent, from the different refrangibility of light, that the rays coming from the same point of an object, when decomposed by the refraction of a lens, must converge to different foci; the red rays, for example, to a point more distant from the lens, and the violet to one nearer by about a fifty-fourth part of the focal distance. Hence it was not merely from the aberration of the rays caused by the spherical figure of the lens that the imperfection of the images formed by refraction arose, but from the very nature of re¬ fraction itself. It was evident, at the same time, that in a combination of lenses with oppo¬ site figures, one convex, for instance, and ano¬ ther concave, there was a tendency of the two contrary dispersions to correct one another",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But it appeared to Newton, on examining dif¬ ferent refracting substances, that the dispersion of the coloured rays never could be corrected except when the refraction itself was entirely destroyed; for he thought he had discovered that the quantity of the refraction and of the dispersion in different substances bore always the same proportion to one another. This is one of the few instances in which his conclusions have not been confirmed by subsequent experi¬ ment ; and it will, accordingly, fall under dis¬ cussion in another part of this Dissertation",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Newton, however, himself possessed excellent hands for mechanical operations, and could use them to better purpose than is common with men so much immersed in deep and abstract speculation. It appears, indeed, that mechani¬ cal invention was one of the powers of his mind which began to unfold itself at a very early pe¬ riod. In some letters subjoined to a Memoir drawn up after his death by his nephew Conduit, it is said, that, when a boy, Newton used to amuse himself with constructing machines, mills, &c. on a small scale, in which he displayed great ingenuity; and it is probable that he then acquired that use of his hands which is so diffi¬ cult to be learned at a later period. To this, probably, we owe the neatness and ingenuity with which the optical experiments above re¬ ferred to were contrived and executed,—experi¬ ments of so difficult a nature, that any error in the manipulation would easily defeat the effect, and appears actually to have done so with many of those who objected to his experiments.1 1 The Memoir of Conduit was sent to Fontenelle when he was preparing the Eloge on Newton, hut he seems o a paid little attention to it, and has passed over the early part of his life with the remark, that one may apply to im w Lucan says of the Nile, that it has not been “ permitted to mortals to see that river in a feeble state.” It the letters a referred to had formed a part of this communication, I think the Secretary of the Academy would ha.ve sacimce a comparison to an instructive fact. In other respects Conduit’s Memoir did not convey much information that cou use.

"Newton, after considering the reflection and re¬ fraction of light, proceeded, in the third and last book of his Optics, to treat of its inflection, a sub¬ ject which, as has been remarked in the former part of this Dissertation, was first treated of by Grimaldi. Newton having admitted a ray of light through a hole in a window-shutter into a dark chamber, made it pass by the edge of a knife, or, in some experiments, between the edges of two knives, fixed parallel and very near to one another; and, by receiving the light on a sheet of paper at different distances behind the knives, he observed the coloured fringes which had been described by the Italian optician, and, on ex¬ amination, found that the rays had been acted on in passing the knife-edges both by repulsive and attractive forces, and had begun to be so acted on in a sensible degree when they were yet distant by of an inch of the edges of the knives.

Fontenelle was too much a philosopher and a man of the world, and had himself approached too near to the persons of princes, to be of Mr Conduit’s opinion, or to think that the approbation of the most illustrious princess could add dignity to the man who had made the three greatest discoveries yet known, and in whose hands the sciences of Geometry, Optics, and Astronomy, had all taken new forms.

Here we have his conclusions con¬ cerning that polarity or peculiar virtue residing in the opposite sides of the rays of light, which he deduced from the enigmatical phenomena of doubly-refracting crystals. Here, also, the first step is made toward the doctrine of elective at¬ tractions or of chemical affinity, and to the no¬ tion, that the phenomena of chemistry, as well as of cohesion, depend on the alternate attrac¬ tions and repulsions existing between the par¬ ticles of bodies at different distances. The com¬ parison of the gradual transition from repulsion to attraction at those distances, with the posi¬ tive and negative quantities in algebra, was first suggested here, and is the same idea which the ingenuity of Boscovich afterwards expanded into such a beautiful and complete system. Others who have attempted such flights had ended in mere fiction and romance: it is only for such men as Bacon or Newton to soar beyond the re¬ gion of poetical fiction, still keeping sight of probability, and alighting again safe on the ter¬ ra jirma of philosophic truth.1 SECTION IV",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The time was now come when the world was to be enlightened by a new science, arising out of the comparison of the phenomena of motion as observed in the heavens, with the laws of motion as known on the earth. Physical astro¬ nomy was the result of this comparison; a science embracing greater objects, and destined for a higher flight, than any other branch of natural knowledge. It is unnecessary to observe, that it was by Newton that the comparison just refer¬ red to was instituted, and the riches of the new science unfolded to mankind",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In 1666, the plague forced him to retire from Cambridge into the country; and, as he sat one day alone, in a garden, musing on the nature of the mysterious force by which the phenomena at the earth’s surface are so much regulated, he observed the apples falling spontaneously from the trees, and the thought occurred to him,— since gravity is a tendency not confined to bodies on the very surface of the earth, but reaching to the tops of trees, to the tops of the highest buildings, nay, to the summits of the most lofty mountains, without its intensity or direction suffering any sensible change, why may it not reach to a much greater distance, and even to the moon itself?

"671 and forced to describe a curve like a projectile at the surface of the earth ?1 Here another consideration very naturally oc¬ curred. Though gravity he not sensibly weak¬ ened at the small distances from the surface to which our experiments extend, it may be weak¬ ened at greater distances, and at the moon may he greatly diminished. To estimate the quan¬ tity of this diminution, Newton appears to have reasoned thus : If the moon he retained in her orbit by her gravitation to the earth, it is pro¬ bable that the planets are, in like manner, car¬ ried round the sun by a power of the same kind with gravity} directed to the centre of that lu¬ minary. He proceeded, therefore, to inquire by what law the tendency or gravitation of the planets to the sun must diminish, in order that, describing, as they do, orbits nearly circular round the sun, their times of revolution and their distances may have the relation to one an¬ other which they are known to have from ob¬ servation, or from the third law of Kepler",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"This was an investigation which, to most even of the philosophers and mathematicians of that age, would have proved an insurmountable ob¬ stacle to their further progress; but Newton was too familiar with the geometry of evanescent or infinitely small quantities, not to discover very soon that the law now referred to would require the force of gravity to diminish exactly as the square of the distance increased. The moon, therefore, being distant from the earth about sixty semidiameters of the earth, the force of gravity at that distance must he reduced to the 3600th part of what it is at the earth’s surface",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In this calculation, however, being at a dis¬ tance from hooks, he took the common estima¬ tion of the earth’s circumference that was in use before the measurement of Norwood or of the French Academicians, according to which a degree is held equal to 60 English miles. This being in reality a very erroneous supposition, the result of the calculation did not represent the force as adequate to the supposed effect; whence Newton concluded that some other cause than gravity must act on the moon, and on that account he laid aside, for the time, all further speculation on the subject. It was in the true spirit of philosophy that he so readily gave up an hypothesis, in which he could not but feel some interest, the moment he found it at variance with observation. He was sensible that nothing but the exact coincidence of the things compared could establish the conclusion he meant to deduce, or authorize him to pro¬ ceed with the superstructure, for which it was to serve as the foundation","Norwood, Newton","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"It appears, that it was not till some years after this that his attention was called to the same subject, by a letter from Dr Hooke, pro¬ posing, as a question, To determine the line in which a body let fall from a height descends to the ground, taking into consideration the motion of the earth on its axis. This induced him to resume the subject of the moon’s motion; and the measure of a degree by Norwood having now furnished more exact data, he found that his calculation gave the precise quantity for the moon’s momentary deflection from the tangent of her orbit, which was deduced from astrono¬ mical observation. The moon, therefore, has a tendency to descend toward the earth, from the same cause that a stone at its surface has; and if the descent of the stone in a second be dimi¬ nished in the ratio of 1 to 3600, it will give the quantity by which the moon descends in a se¬ cond, below the tangent to her orbit • and thus is obtained an experimental proof of the fact, that gravity decreases as the square of the dis¬ tance increases. He had already found that the times of the planetary revolutions, supposing their orbits to be circular, led to the same con¬ clusion ; and he now proceeded, with a view to the solution of Hooke’s problem, to inquire what their orbits must be, supposing the centripetal 1 Pembertox’s View of Newton's Philosophy, Pref","Norwood, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"What seems very difficult to he explained is, that after having made trial of his strength, and of the power of the instruments of investi¬ gation which he was now in possession of, and had entered by means of them on the noblest and most magnificent field of investigation that was ever yet opened to any of the human race, he again desisted from the pursuit, so that it was not till several years afterwards that the conversation of Dr Halley, who made him a visit at Cambridge, induced him to resume and extend his researches",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"He then found, that the three great facts in astronomy, which form the laws of Kepler, gave the most complete evidence to the system of gravitation. The first of them, the propor¬ tionality of the areas described by the radius vector to the times in which they are described, is the peculiar character of the motions pro¬ duced by an original impulse impressed on a body, combined with a centripetal force contin¬ ually urging it to a given centre. The second law, that the planets describe ellipses, having the sun in one of the foci, common to them all, coincides with this proposition, that a body under the influence of a centripetal force, varying as the square of the distance inversely, and having any projectile force whatever originally im¬ pressed on it, must describe a conic section having one focus in the centre of force, which section, if the projectile force does not exceed a certain limit, will become an ellipse. The third law, that the squares of the periodic times are as the cubes of the distances, is a property which belongs to the bodies describing elliptic orbits under the conditions just stated. Thus the three great truths to which the astronomy of the planets had been reduced by Kepler, were all explained in the most satisfactory manner, by the supposition that the planets gravitate to the sun with a force which varies in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. It added much to this evidence, that the observations of Cassini had proved the same laws to prevail among the satellites of Jupiter",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"But did the principle which appeared thus to unite the great bodies of the universe act only on those bodies ? Did it reside merely in their centres, or was it a force common to all the particles of matter? Was it a fact that every particle of matter had a tendency to unite with every other ? Or was that tendency directed only to particular centres ? It could hardly he doubt¬ ed that the tendency was common to all the par¬ ticles of matter. The centres of the great bodies had no properties as mathematical points; they had none hut what they derived from the mate¬ rial particles distributed around them. But the question admitted of being brought to a better test than that of such general reasoning as the preceding. The bodies between which this ten¬ dency had been observed to take place were all round bodies, and either spherical or nearly so; but whether great or small, they seemed to gravitate toward one another according to the same law. The planets gravitated to the sun, the moon to the earth, the satellites of Jupiter toward Jupiter; and gravity, in all these in¬ stances, varied inversely as the squares of the distances. Were the bodies ever so small—were they mere particles—provided only they were round, it was therefore safe to infer, that they would tend to unite with forces inversely as the squares of the distances. It was probable, then, that gravity was the mutual tendency of all the particles of matter toward one another; but this could not be concluded with certainty, till it was found whether great spherical bodies, composed of particles gravitating according to this law, would themselves gravitate according to the same. Perhaps no man of that age but Newton himself was fit to undertake the solution of this problem. His analysis, either in the form of flux¬ ions or in that of prime and ultimate ratios, was able to reduce it to the quadrature of curves; and he then found, no doubt infinitely to his satisfac¬ tion, that the law was the same for the sphere as DISSERTATION FOURTH","Jupiter, Jupiter, Newton",US,8,United States,North America

Hence points, such as the centres of the sun or of the also their mean densities, or mean specific gra- planets, it was only on account of the quantity vities, became known. For from their distances of matter collected and distributed uniformly and the angles they subtended, both known from round those points, through which, therefore, observation, their magnitudes or cubical contents the force resulting from the composition of all were easily inferred; and the densities of all those elements must pass either accurately or bodies are, as their quantities of matter, divided nearly. . by their magnitude.

"675 are no less curious to be remarked. Though so well acquainted with the nature of gravity on the earth’s surface, the object of so many of his researches and discoveries,—and though he conceived it to exist in all the planets, nay, in all the celestial bodies, and to be the cause of their round figure, he did not believe it to be a power that extended from one of those bodies to another. He seems to have thought that gravity was a principle which reg'ulated the domestic economy of each particular body, but had no¬ thing to do with their external relations; so that he censured Kepler for supposing that the phenomena of the tides are produced by the gravitation of the waters of the ocean to the moon.1 Hooke did not stop short in the same unac¬ countable manner, but made a nearer approach to the truth than any one had yet done. In his attempt to prove the motion of the earth, pub¬ lished in 1674, he lays it down as the principle on which the celestial motions are to be ex¬ plained, that the heavenly bodies have an attrac¬ tion or gravitation toward their own centres, which extends to other bodies within the sphere of their activity; and that all bodies would move in straight lines, if some force like this did not act on them continually, and compel them to describe circles, ellipses, or other curve lines. The force of gravity, also, he considered as greatest nearest the body, though the law of its variation he could not determine. These are great advances;—though, from his mention of the sphere of activity, from his considering the force as residing in the centre, and from his ig¬ norance of the law which it observed, it is evi- -dent that, besides great vagueness, there was much error in his notions about gravity. Hooke, however, whose candour and uprightness bore no proportion to the strength of his understand¬ ing, was disingenuous enough, when Newton had determined that law, to lay claim himself to the discovery",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"This is the farthest advance that the know¬ ledge of the cause of the celestial motions had made before the investigations of Newton : it is the precise point at which this knowledge had stopped, having met with a resistance which required a mathematician armed with all the powers of the new analysis to overcome. The doctrine of gravity was yet no more than a con¬ jecture, of the truth or falsehood of which the measurements and reasonings of geometry could alone determine",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Thus, then, we are enabled accurately to per¬ ceive in what Newton’s discovery consisted. It was in giving the evidence of demonsti’ation to a principle which a few sagacious men had been sufficiently sharp-sighted to see obscurely or in¬ accurately, and to propose as a mere conjecture",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In the history of human knowledge, there is hardly any discovery to which some gradual approaches had not been made before it was completely brought to light. To have found out the means of giving certainty to the thing asserted, or of disproving it entirely, and, when the reality of the principle was found out, to measure its quantity, to ascertain its laws, and to ti’ace their consequences with mathematical precision,—in this consists the great difficulty and the great merit of such a discovery as that which is now before us.

"Ptolemy. Newton, therefore, was very natu¬ rally led to inquire what the different forces were, which, according to the laws just esta¬ blished, could produce irregularities in the case of the moon’s motion. Beside the force of the earth, or rather of the mutual gravitation of the moon and earth, the moon must he acted on by the sun; and the same force which was suffi¬ cient to bend the orbit of the earth into an el¬ lipse, could not but have a sensible effect on the orbit of the moon. Here Newton immediately observed, that it is not the whole of the force which the sun exerts cn the moon that disturbs her motion round the earth, but only the differ¬ ence between the force just mentioned and that which the sun exerts on the earth ; for it is only that difference that affects the relative positions of the two bodies. To have exact measures of the disturbing forces, he supposed the entire force of the sun on the moon to be resolved into two, of which one always passed through the centre of the earth, and the other was always parallel to the line joining the sun and earth,— consequently, to the direction of the force of the sun on the earth. The former of these forces being directed to the centre of the earth, did not prevent the moon from describing equal areas in equal times round the earth. The ef¬ fect of it on the whole, however, he showed to be, to diminish the gravity of the moon to the earth by about one 358th part, and to increase her mean distance in the same proportion, and her angular motion by about a 179111",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"There was a sort of cloud, therefore, which hung over this point of the lunar theory, to dissipate which required higher improvements in the cal¬ culus than it was given to the inventor himself to accomplish. It was not so with respect to another motion to which the plane of the lunar orbit is subject, a phenomenon which had been long known in consequence of its influence on the eclipses of the sun and moon. This was the retrogradation of the line of nodes, amounting to 3' 10"" every day. Newton showed that the second of the forces into which the solar action is moved being exerted, not in the plane of the moon’s orbit, but in that of the ecliptic, inclined to the former at an angle somewhat greater than five degrees, its effect must be to draw down the moon to the plane of the ecliptic sooner than it would otherwise arrive at it; in consequence of which, the intersection of the two planes would approach, as it were, toward the moon, or move in a direction opposite to that of the moon’s mo¬ tion, or become retrograde. From the quantity of the solar force, and the inclination of the moon’s orbit, Newton determined the mean quantity of this retrogradation, as well as the irregularities to which it is subject, and found both to agree very accurately with observation",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Another of the lunar inequalities,—that dis¬ covered by Tycho, and called by him the Vari¬ ation, which consists in the alternate accelera¬ tion and retardation of the moon in each quarter of her revolution,—was accurately determined from theory, such as it is found by observation; and the same is true as to the annual equation, which had been long confounded with the equa¬ tion of time. With regard to the other inequa¬ lities, it does not appear that Newton attempted an exact determination of them, but satisfied himself with this general truth, that the prin¬ ciple of the sun’s disturbing force led to the sup¬ position of inequalities of the same kind with those actually observed, though whether of the same exact quantity it must be difficult to deter- DISSERTATION FOURTH",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"While Newton was thus so successfully occu¬ pied in tracing the action of gravity among those distant bodies, he did not, it may be supposed, neglect the consideration of its effects on the ob¬ jects which are nearer us, and particularly on the figure of the earth. We have seen that, even with the limited views and imperfect in¬ formation which Copernicus possessed on this subject, he ascribed the round figure of the earth and of the planets to the force of gravity residing in the particles, of these bodies. Newton, on the other hand, perceived that, in the earth, another force was combined with gravity, and that the figure resulting from that combination could not be exactly spherical. The diurnal revolution of the earth, he knew, must produce a centrifugal force, which would act most powerfully on the parts most distant from the axis. The amount of this centrifugal force is greatest at the equa¬ tor ; and being measured by the momentary re¬ cess of any point from the tangent, which was known from the earth’s rotation, it could he com¬ pared with the force of gravity at the same place, measured in like manner by the descent of a heavy body in the first moment of its fall",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In order to determine the proportion of the axes of this spheroid, a problem, it will readily be believed, of no ordinary difficulty, Newton conceived, that if the waters at the pole and at the equator were to communicate by a canal through the interior of the earth, one branch reaching from the pole to the centre, and the other at right angles to it from the centre to the circumference of the equator, the water in this canal must be in equilibrio, or the weight of fluid in the one branch just equal to that in the other. Including, then, the consideration of the centrifugal force which acted on one of the branches but not on the other, and considering, too, that the figure of the mass being no longer a sphere, the attraction must not be supposed to be directed to the centre, but must be consider¬ ed as the result of the action of all the particles of the spheroid on the fluid in the canals,—by a Very subtile process of reasoning, Newton found that the longer of the two canals must be to the shorter as 230 to 229. This, therefore, is the ratio of the radius of the equator to the polar semiaxis, their difference amounting, according to the dimensions then assigned to the earth, to about English miles. In this investiga¬ tion the earth is understood to be homogeneous, or everywhere of the same density","Newton, Newton","US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"It is very remarkable, that though the ingeni¬ ous and profound reasoning on which this con¬ clusion rests is not entirely above objection, and assumes some things without sufficient proof, yet, when these defects were corrected in the new investigations of Maclaurin and Clairaut, the conclusion, supposing the earth homogene¬ ous, remained exactly the same. The sagacity of Newton, like the Genius of Socrates, seemed sometimes to inspire him with wisdom from an invisible source. By a profound study of na¬ ture, her laws, her analogies, and her resources, he seems to have acquired the same sort of tact or feeling in matters of science, that experienced engineers and other artists sometimes acquire in matters of practice, by which they are often di- 678 preliminary dissertations",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"From the figure of the earth thus determined, he showed that the intensity of gravity at any point of the surface is inversely as the distance of that point from the centre; and its increase, therefore, on going from the equator to the poles, is as the square of the sine of the latitude, the same ratio in which the degrees of the meridian increase.1 As the intensity of gravity diminish¬ ed on going from the poles to the equator, or from the higher to the lower latitudes, it follow¬ ed that a pendulum of a given length would vibrate slower when carried from Europe into the torrid zone. The observations of the two French astronomers Varin and De Hayes, made at Cayenne and Martinique, had already confirm¬ ed this conclusion",Cayenne,"MQ,GF,FR",8,"Martinique,French Guiana,France","North America,South America,Europe"
"The problem which Newton had thus resolved enabled him to resolve one of still greater diffi¬ culty. The precession, that is, the retrograda- tion, of the equinoctial points, had been long known to astronomers; its rate had been measur¬ ed by a comparison of ancient and modern ob¬ servations, and found to amount nearly to 50"" annually, so as to complete an entire revolution of the heavens in 25,920 years. Nothing seem¬ ed more difficult to explain than this phenome¬ non, and no idea of assigning a physical or me¬ chanical cause for it had yet occurred, I believe, to the boldest and most theoretical astronomer",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"679 The doctrines of Plato and Aristotle were never more perfect than when they came from the hands of their respective authors ; and a le¬ gion of commentators, with all their efforts, did nothing but run round perpetually in the same circle. Even Descartes, though he had recourse to physical principles, and tried to fix his sys¬ tem on a firmer basis than the mere abstractions of the mind, left behind him a work which not only could not be improved, but was such, that every addition attempted to be made destroyed the equilibrium of the mass, and pulled away the part to which it was intended that it should be attached. The philosophy of Newton has proved susceptible of continual improvement; its theories have explained facts quite unknown to the author of it; and the exertions of La¬ grange and Laplace, at the distance of a hun¬ dred years, have perfected a work which it was not for any of the human race to begin and to complete","Plato, Newton, Laplace","US,CO",8,"United States,Colombia","North America,South America"
"Newton next turned his attention to the phe¬ nomena of the Tides, the dependence of which on the moon, and in part also on the sun, was sufficiently obvious even from common observa¬ tion. That the moon is the prime ruler of the tide, is evident from the fact, that the high- water, at any given place, occurs always nearly at the moment when the moon is on the same meridian, and that the retardation of the tide from day to day is the same with the retarda¬ tion of the moon in her diurnal revolution. That the sun is also concerned in the production of the tides is evident from this, that the highest tides happen when the sun, the moon, and the earth are all three in the same straight line; and that the lowest, or neap tides, happen when the lines drawn from the sun and moon to the earth make right angles with one another. The eye of Newton, accustomed to generalize and to penetrate beyond the surface of things, saw that the waters of the sea revolving with the earth are nearly in the condition of a satellite revolv¬ ing about its primary, and are liable to the same kind of disturbance from the attraction of a third body. The fact in the history of the tides which seems most difficult to be explained, received, on this supposition, a very easy solu¬ tion. It is known that high-water always takes place in the hemisphere where the moon is, and in the opposite hemisphere where the moon is not, nearly at the same time. This seems, at first sight, very unlike an effect of the moon’s attraction; for, though the water in the hemi¬ sphere where the moon is, and which therefore is nearest the moon, may be drawn up toward that body, the same ought not to happen in the opposite hemisphere, where the earth’s surface is most distant from the moon. But if the ac¬ tion of the moon disturb the equilibrium of the ocean, just as the action of one planet disturbs the motion of a satellite moving round another, it is exactly what might be expected. It had been shown that the moon, in conjunction with the sun, has her gravitation to the earth dimi¬ nished, and when in opposition to the sun has it dimihishyd very nearly by the same quantity","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"were shown by Newton to explain those ine¬ qualities in the elevation of the waters of the ocean to which we give the name of tides. On the principle also explained in this analysis it is that the attraction of the sun and moon conspire to elevate the waters of the ocean, whe¬ ther these luminaries be in opposition or con¬ junction. In both cases the solar and lunar tides are added together, and the tide actually observ¬ ed is their sum. At the quadratures, or the first and third quarters, these two sides are opposed to one another, the high water of the lunar tide coinciding with the low water of the solar, and conversely, so that the tide actually observed is the difference of the two",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Small as this force is, when it is applied to every particle of the ocean, it is capable of pro¬ ducing a sensible effect. The manner in which Newton estimates this effect can only be con¬ sidered as affording an approximation to the truth. In treating of the figure of the earth, he had shown that the centrifugal force, amount¬ ing to jig of gravity, was able to raise the level of the ocean more than seventeen miles, or, more exactly, 85,472 French feet. Hence, making the effect proportional to the forces, the elevation of the waters produced by the solar force will come out 1*92 foot",Newton,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
The calculus of Newton stopped not here,Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Subsequent investigations, as we shall have occasion to remark, have shown that much was yet wanting to a complete theory of the tides; and that even after Maclaurin, Bernoulli, and Euler2 had added their efforts to those of New¬ ton, there remained enough to give full employ¬ ment to the calculus of Laplace. As an ori¬ ginal deduction, and as a first approximation, that of which I have now given an account will be for ever memorable",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"681 ledged to belong to the heavens, and to be placed beyond the region of the earth’s atmo¬ sphere ; but with regard to their motion, astro¬ nomers were not agreed. Kepler believed them to move in straight lines; Cassini thought they moved in the planes of great circles, but with little curvature. Hevelius had come much nearer the truth: he had shown the curvature of their paths to be different in different parts, and to be greatest when they were nearest the sun; and a parabola having its vertex in that point seemed to him to be the line in which the comet moved. Newton, convinced of the universality of the principle of gra¬ vitation, had no doubt that the orbit of the comet must be a conic section, having the sun in one of its foci, and might either be an ellipse, a parabola, or even an hyperbola, according to the relation between the force of projection and the force tending to the centre. As the eccen¬ tricity of the orbit on every supposition must be great, the portion of it that fell within our view could not differ much from a parabola; a cir¬ cumstance which rendered the calculation of the comet’s place, when the position of the orbit was once ascertained, more easy than in the case of the planets. Thus far theory proceeded; and observation must then determine with what de¬ gree of accuracy this theory represented the phenomena. From three observations of the comet the position of the orbit could be deter¬ mined, though the geometric problem was one of great difficulty. Newton gave a solution of it; and it was by this that his theory was to be brought to the test of experiment. If the orbit thus determined was not the true one, the places of the comet calculated on the supposition that it was, and that it described equal areas in equal times about the sun, could not agree with the places actually observed. Newton showed, by the example of the remarkable comet then vi¬ sible, (1680) that this agreement was as great as could reasonably be expected; thus adding another proof to the number of those already brought to support the principle of universal gravitation. The comets descend into our sys¬ tem from all different quarters in the heavens, and therefore the proofs that they afforded went to show, that the action of gravity was confined to no particular region of the heavens","Newton, Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Thus far Newton proceeded in ascertaining the existence, and in tracing the effects, of the principle of gravitation, and had done so with a success of which there had been no instance in the history of human knowledge. At the same time that it was the most successful, it was the most difficult research that had yet been under¬ taken. The reasonings upward from the facts to the general principle, and again down from that principle to its effects, both required the application of a mathematical analysis which was but newly invented; and Newton had not only the difficulties of the investigation to en¬ counter, but the instrument to invent, without which the investigation could not have been conducted. Every one who considers all this will readily join in the sentiment with which Bailly closes a eulogy as just as it is eloquent: “ Si, comme Platon Fa pense, il existoit dans la na¬ ture une bchelle d’etres et de substances intelligentes jusqu’a VEtre Supreme, Vespece humaine, de¬ fendant ses droits, auroit une foule de grands hommes d presenter ; mais Newton, suim de ses verites pures, montreroit le plus haut degre de force de Vesprit humain, et svffiroit seul pour lui assignor sa vraie place.”1 Though the creative power of genius was never more clearly evinced than in the discoveries of this great philosopher, yet the influence of cir¬ cumstances, always extensive and irresistible in human affairs, can readily be traced. The con¬ dition of knowledge at the time when Newton appeared was favourable to great exertions; it was a moment when things might be said to be prepared for a revolution in the mathematical and physical sciences. The genius of Copernicus had unfolded the true system of the world; and Galileo had shown its excellence, and established it by arguments, the force of which were gene¬ rally acknowledged. Kepler had done still more, having, by an admirable effort of generalization, reduced the facts concerning the planetary mo¬ tions to three general laws. Cassini’s observa¬ tions had also extended the third of these laws 1 Histoire de VAstronomic Moderne, tome II. livre xii. sect. 49","Newton, Newton, Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"to the satellites of Jupiter, showing that the squares of their periodic times were as the cubes of their distances from the centre of the body round which they revolved. T. he imaginary ap¬ paratus of cycles and epicycles, the immobility of the earth,—the supposed essential distinction between celestial and terrestrial substances, those insuperable obstacles to real knowledge, which the prejudice of the ancients had establish¬ ed as physical truths, were entirely removed; and Bacon had taught the true laws of philoso¬ phizing, and pointed out the genuine method of extracting knowledge from experiment and ob¬ servation. The leading principles of mechanics were established; and it was no unimportant circumstance, that the Vortices of Descartes had exhausted one of the sources of error, most se¬ ducing on account of its simplicity",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"All this had been done when the genius of Newton arose upon the earth. Never till now had there been set before any of the human race so brilliant a career to run, or so noble a prize to he obtained. In the progress of knowledge, a moment had arrived more favourable to the de¬ velopment of talent than any other, either later or earlier, and in which it might produce the greatest possible effect. But, let it not he sup¬ posed, while I thus admit the influence of ex¬ ternal circumstances on the exertions of intellec¬ tual power, that I am lessening the merit of this last, or taking any thing from the admiration that is due to it. I am, in truth, only distin¬ guishing between what it is possible and what it is impossible for the human mind to effect",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"With ail the aid that circumstances could give, it required the highest degree of intellectual power to accomplish what Newton performed",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"When one considers the splendour of New¬ ton’s discoveries, the beauty, the simplicity, and grandeur of the system they unfolded, and the demonstrative evidence by which that system was supported, one could hardly doubt that, to he received, it required only to he made known, and that the establishment of the Newtonian philosophy all over Europe would very quickly have followed the publication of it. In drawing this conclusion, however, we should make much too small an allowance for the influence of re¬ ceived opinion, and the resistance that mere ha¬ bit is able, for a time, to oppose to the strongest evidence. The Cartesian system of vortices had many followers in all the countries of Europe, and particularly in France. In the universities of England, though the Aristotelian Physics had made an obstinate resistance, they had been sup¬ planted by the Cartesian, which became firmly established about the time when their founda¬ tion began to he sapped by the general progress of science, and particularly by the discoveries of Newton. For more than thirty years after the publication of those discoveries, the system of vortices kept its ground; and a translation from the French into Latin of the Physios of Rohault, a work entirely Cartesian, continued at Cambridge to he the text for philosophical in¬ struction. About the year 1718, a new and more elegant translation of the same book was published by Dr Samuel Clarke, with the addi¬ tion of notes, in which that profound and inge¬ nious writer explained the views of Newton on the principal objects of discussion; so that the notes contained virtually a refutation of the text: they did so, however, only virtually, all appear¬ ance of argument and controversy being care¬ fully avoided. Whether this escaped the notice of the learned Doctors or not, is uncertain; hut the new translation, from its better Latinity, and the name of the editor, was readily admit¬ ted to all the academical honours which the old one had enjoyed. Thus, the stratagem of Dr Clarke completely succeeded; the tutor might prelect from the text, hut the pupil would some¬ times look into the notes; and error is never so sure of being exposed as when the truth is placed close to it, side by side, without any thing to alarm prejudice, or awaken from its lethargy the dread of innovation. Thus, therefore, the Newtonian philosophy first entered the Univer- DISSERTATION FOURTH","Newton, Cambridge, Newton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

In France, we find the first astronomers and mathemati¬ cians, such men as Cassini and Maraldi, quite un¬ acquainted with it, and employed in calculating the paths of the comets they w'ere observing, on hypotheses the most unfounded and imaginary; long after Halley, following the principles of Newton, had computed tables from which the motions of all the comets that ever had appear¬ ed, or ever could appear, might be easily deduc¬ ed.

"The principle of gravitation itself was con¬ sidered as difficult to be admitted. When pre¬ sented indeed as a mere fact, like the weight of bodies at the earth’s surface, or their tendency to fall to the ground, it was free from objection; and it was in this light only that Newton wish¬ ed it to be considered.2 But though this appears to be the sound and philosophical view of the subject, there has always appeared a strong de¬ sire in those who speculated concerning gravita¬ tion to go farther, and to inquire into the cause of what, as a mere fact, they were sufficiently disposed to admit. If you said that you had no explanation to give, and were only desirous of having the fact admitted, they alleged that this was an unsatisfactory proceeding,—that it was admitting the doctrine of occult causes,—that it amounted to the assertion, that bodies acted in places where they were not,—a proposition that, metaphysically considered, was undoubted- Th^ U""lveiT.ties Andrews and Edinburgh were, I believe, the first in Britain where the Newtonian nhilosonhi was made the subject of the academical prelections. For this distinction they are indebted to James and David Gregory the first in some respects the rival, but both the friends of Newton. Whiston bewails in the anguish of his heart the dif ference in this respect between those universities and his own. David Gregory taught in Edinburgh for several year prior to 1690 when he removed to Oxford ; and Whiston says, “ He had already caused several of his scholars to ^e acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian philosophy, while we at Cambridge (poor wretches) were J nomimousiy studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesian.” (Whiston’s Memoirs of his own Life.)

"ly absurd. The desire to explain gravitation is indeed so natural, that Newton himself felt its force, and has thrown out, at the end of his Optics, some curious conjectures concerning this general affection of body, and the nature of that elastic ether to which he thought that it was perhaps to he ascribed. “ Is not this medium (the ether) much rarer within the dense bodies of the sun, stars, and planets, than in the empty celestial spaces between them ? And, in passing from them to great distances, does it not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies to one another, every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium to the rarer P”1 Notwithstanding the highest respect for the author of these conjectures, I cannot find any thing like a satisfactory explanation of gravity in the existence of this elastic ether. It is very true that an elastic fluid, of which the density followed the inverse ratio of the distance from a given point, would urge the bodies immersed in it, and impervious to it, toward that point with forces inversely as the squares of the distances from it; but what could maintain an elastic fluid in this condition, or with its density vary¬ ing according to this law, is a thing as inexpli¬ cable as the gravity which it was meant to ex¬ plain. The nature of an elastic fluid must be, in the absence of all inequality of pressure, to become everywhere of the same density. If the causes that produce so marked and so general a deviation from this rule be not assigned, we can only be said to have substituted one difficulty for another",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"A different view of the matter was taken by some of tbe disciples and friends of Newton, but which certainly did not lead to any thing more satisfactory. That philosopher himself had always expressed his decided opinion that gravity could not be considered as a property of matter;2 but Mr Cotes, in the preface to the second edition of the Principia, maintains that gravity is a property which we have the same right to ascribe to matter, that we have to ascribe to it extension, impenetrability, or any other property. This is said to have been in¬ serted without the knowledge of Newton,—a freedom which it is difficult to conceive that any man could use with the author of the Principia","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"The degrees growing less as they approached the pole, was an indication of the curvature growing greater, or of the longer axis of the meridian being the line that passed through the poles, and that coincided with the axis of the earth. The figure of the earth must, therefore, be that of an oblong spheroid, or one formed by the revolution of an ellipsis about its longer axis. This conclusion seemed to be strengthened by the prolongation of the meridian from Amiens northward to Dunkirk in 1713, as the same di¬ minution was observed; the medium length of the degree between Paris and Dunkirk being 56970 toises, no less than 137 less than the mean of the degrees toward the south.1 All this seemed quite inconsistent with the observations on the pendulum, as well as with the conclusions which Newton had deduced from the theory of gravity. The Academy of Sciences was thus greatly perplexed, and uncertain to what side to incline. In these circumstances, J. Cassini, whose errors were the cause of all the difficulty, had the merit of suggesting the only means by which the question concerning the figure of the earth was likely to receive a satisfactory solu¬ tion,—the measurement of two degrees, the one under the equator, and the other as near to the pole as the nature of the thing would admit","Amiens, Paris, Newton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"In addition to these discoveries in physical astronomy, this period affords several on the descriptive parts of the science, of which, how¬ ever, I can only mention one, as far too impor¬ tant to be passed over in the most general out¬ line. It regards the apparent motion in the fixed stars, known by the name of the Aberra¬ tion, and is the discovery of Dr Bradley, one of the most distinguished astronomers of whom England has to boast. Bradley and his friend Molyneux, in the end of the year i725,a were occupied in searching for the parallax of the fixed stars by means of a zenith sector, con¬ structed by Graham, the most skilful instru¬ ment maker of that period. The sector was erected at Kew; it was of great radius, and furnished with a telescope twenty-four feet in length, with which they proposed to observe the transits of stars near the zenith, according to a method that was first suggested by Hooke, and pursued by him so far as to induce him to think that he had actually discovered the paral¬ lax of y Draconis, the bright star in the head of the dragon, on which he made his observations","Bradley, Graham",US,8,United States,North America
"This motion occasioned a good deal of sur¬ prise to the two observers, as it lay the contrary way to what it would have done if it had pro¬ ceeded from the parallax of the star. The re¬ petition of the observations, however, confiimed their accuracy; and they were afterwards pur¬ sued by Dr Bradley, with another sector con¬ structed also by Graham, of a less radius, but still of one sufficiently great to measure a star’s zenith distance to half a second. It embraced a larger arch, and admitted of the observations being extended to stars that passed at a more considerable distance from the zenith",Graham,US,8,United States,North America
"Even with this addition the observations did not put Bradley in possession of the complete fact, as they only gave the motion of each star in declination, without giving information about what change might be produced in its right as¬ cension",Bradley,US,8,United States,North America
"Bradley saw that Roemer’s observation con¬ cerning the time that light takes to go from the sun to the earth gave a ready expression for the velocity of light compared with that of the earth. The proportion, however, which he as¬ sumed as best suited to his observations was somewhat different; it was that of 10313 to 1, which made the radius of the circle of aberra¬ tion 20"", and the transverse axis of the ellipse in every case, or the whole change of position, 40"". It was the shorter axis which Bradley had actually observed in the case of y Draconis, DISSERTATION FOURTH","Bradley, Bradley",US,8,United States,North America
"It has been remarked, that the velocity of light, as assumed by Bradley, did not exactly agree with that which Roemer had assigned: supposing the total amount of the aberration 40^"", it gave the time that light takes to come from the sun to the earth S' 13""; but it is pro¬ per to add, that since the time of this astrono¬ mer, the velocity of light deduced from the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites has been found exactly the same","Bradley, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"It is remarkable that the phenomenon thus discovered by Bradley and Molyneux, when in search of the parallax of the fixed stars, is in reality as convincing a proof of the earth’s mo¬ tion in its orbit as the discovery of that paral¬ lax would have been. It seems, indeed, as sa¬ tisfactory as any evidence that can be desired",Bradley,US,8,United States,North America
"Newton and Leibnitz are so distinguished from the rest even of the scientific world, that we can only compare them with one another, though, in fact, no two intellectual characters, who both reached the highest degree of excellence, were ever more dissimilar",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"soon proved equally inventive in the pure and in the mixed mathematics. Newton knew how to transfer the truths of abstract science to the study of things actually existing, and, by return¬ ing in the opposite direction, to enrich the foi - mer by ideas derived from the latter. In expe¬ rimental and inductive investigation he was as great as in the pure mathematics, and his disco¬ veries as distinguished in the one as in the other",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In this double claim to renown, Newton stands yet unrivalled; and though, in the pure mathe¬ matics, equals may perhaps be found, no one, I believe, will come forward as his rival both in that science and in the philosophy of nature",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"As an interpreter of nature, therefore, Leibnitz stands in no comparison with Newton. His general views in physics were vague and unsatis¬ factory; he had no great value for inductive reasoning; it was not the way of arriving at truth which he was accustomed to take; and hence, to the greatest physical discovery of that age, and that which was established by the most ample induction, the existence of gravity as a fact in which all bodies agree, he was always incredulous, because no proof of it, a 'priori, could be given",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"As to who benefited human knowledge the most, no question, therefore, can arise; and if genius is to be weighed in this balance, it is evident which scale must preponderate. Except in the pure mathematics, Leibnitz, with all his talents, made no material or permanent addition to the sciences. Newton, to equal inventions in mathematics added the greatest discoveries in the philosophy of nature; and, in passing through his hands, Mechanics, Optics, and Astronomy, were not merely improved, but renovated. No one ever left knowledge in a state so different from that in which he found it. Men were in¬ structed not only in new truths, but in new methods of discovering truth; they were made acquainted with the great principle which con¬ nects together the most distant regions of space, as well as the most remote periods of duration ; and which was to lead to future discoveries, far beyond what the wisest or most sanguine could anticipate",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The progress of Mathematical and Physical Science during the brilliant period which closed with Newton and Leibnitz, has been treated with fidelity and sustained interest by the hand of a master, whose calm judgment weighed impar¬ tially the different claims of discovery, whose powers of illustration could expand the fine re¬ sults, and whose luminous eloquence was com¬ mensurate with the dignity of the subject. To resume the Discourse, and continue it through the course of the eighteenth century, is a task of increasing difficulty, which would require vi¬ gorous resolution, patient research, and skilful selection. The materials are ample, indeed, hut they are likewise multifarious, and often lie scat¬ tered among the countless volumes of the Trans¬ actions of Learned Societies. The picture to be delineated is not less imposing, and has far greater extent and variety of outline, while it exhibits more elaboration in its details",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Newton, the glory of our island, had no com¬ petitor save Leibnitz in mathematical invention; but his sublime discoveries in the highest walks of science—in Optics and Astronomy—gave him a pre-eminence far above the most towering ri¬ val. Yet such is the slow progress of innova¬ tion, even among the learned, that, for the space of nearly half a century, his Theory of Light was generally slighted, and the system of Universal Attraction treated as a mere fanci¬ ful hypothesis. The Principia, which crowned the exertions of the creator of philosophical science, was admired and imperfectly under- 692 preliminary dissertations",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"stood by a few of his countrymen, but had to undergo the ordeal of a rigorous and sometimes unfriendly examination by foreigners. Averse from the bustle and contention of letteis, lie delighted to pursue his profound researches in perfect seclusion, and had appeared satisfied with registering the grand series of discoveries in that concentrated form which best accorded with the tone of his mighty intellect. When af¬ terwards persuaded reluctantly to publish those brief compositions, he could not submit to the drudgery of retracing his steps, or of expanding his demonstrations, and bringing them nearer the reach of his contemporaries. Newton was nine years in possession of the Method of Fluxions before Leibnitz struck into a similar path; nor did he give it to the world till an equal time more had elapsed. The rapid mind of the German philosopher had framed his Cal¬ culus with less regard to elegance and strict lo¬ gic, but clothed it in a simpler and more defi¬ nite notation or algorithm, which, from its apt¬ ness to improvement, has in the sequel confer¬ red a decided superiority. The diversified oc¬ cupations of Leibnitz allowed him to work only at intervals on his great invention ; but he found most able and zealous coadjutors in the two Bernoullis, who laboured in promoting the new calculus with uncommon ingenuity, indefati¬ gable activity, and even a contentious emula¬ tion. The Higher Analysis had by such exer¬ tions already acquired greater extension on the Continent than the Method of Fluxions at its first publication in England; and our mathema¬ ticians were hence unprepared to follow many of the abstruse and abbreviated demonstrations inserted in the Principia. The Differential and Integral Calculus having thus made such rapid advances abroad, continued for a long time af¬ terwards to maintain a preponderating ascend¬ ancy. The marks of the Fluxionary Method, consisting in mere dots, and therefore not sus¬ ceptible of variation or improvement, sensibly though indirectly checked the tide of invention in England ; and perhaps the splendour of New¬ ton’s fame had some influence for a season in overdazzling the lustre of native talent. As a parallel instance, it may be remarked that no¬ thing pre-eminent in science was produced by the French, for half a century after the epoch of Descartes",Newton,"US,DE,FR",8,"United States,Germany,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The immediate successors of Newton were still imperfectly prepared to rise to the sublimi¬ ty of their great master, or to scan the vast su¬ perstructure which his genius had reared. Yet was more scientific invention displayed by them than had appeared at any former period in Eng¬ land; and nothing but the comparison with transcendant powers of intellect could tend to depress their just merits. By their zealous ef¬ forts the System of the Universe was consolidat¬ ed, and its outworks enlarged. Cotes, who was snatched away at an early age, discovered the beautiful theorems of Trinomial Factors, and multiplied the resources of integration by skil¬ ful applications of Logarithms and Circular Arcs",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Bradley, who has been justly styled the modern Hipparchus, combined the habits of accurate observation with the talent of acute discernment and felicitous invention. His analysis of the Aberration of Light furnished the first incon¬ trovertible proof of our Solar System ; while his fine detection of the Nutation of the Earth’s i\.xis confirmed the Theory of Universal At¬ traction. Simpson, but above all Maclaurin, the elegant expounder of the Principia, likewise materially contributed, by their various mathe¬ matical researches, to the advancement of the science of Physical Astronomy. Nor was Eng¬ land less indebted to the ingenuity and exqui¬ site skill of her artists, who now constructed in¬ struments of a delicacy far surpassing any for¬ mer attempts, and during the last century fui- nished for the most part the Observatories on the Continent",Bradley,US,8,United States,North America
"693 continued to encourage philosophical pursuits; and now, hy directing the mensuration of the Meridian at the most distant points,—within the Arctic Circle, and under the Equator,—it pro¬ cured accurate data for determining the true figure of our Planet. It was the more precise measure of a degree of latitude ascertained hy Picard, that had at last enabled Newton to sub¬ ject to the test of calculation his grand idea of extending the power of gravitation from the earth’s surface, after the simplest law of de¬ crease, to the orbit of the moon. But the satis¬ faction was reserved for the successors of our immortal chief, to see his determination of the oblate form of the earth, arising from the mu¬ tual attraction of all its particles, modified by the influence of centrifugal force, fully confirm¬ ed by a close investigation of the results of the skilful and laborious observations brought home by the French astronomers. Nothing, indeed, contributed so much to exalt the character of the Newtonian Philosophy on the Continent as those scientific expeditions; while the credit of the system of Descartes, which bears no such scrutiny, rapidly declined. Mathematicians, in¬ vited to a rich field of discovery, were eager to examine the Principia through all its details; and the progress which the New Calculus had made, provided them with instruments for this dissection. The profound author had left in¬ deed several parts unfinished; of some of the more difficult problems he had merely sketched the solution; and he had commonly supplied the defects of his analytical procedure by the exer¬ cise of wonderful sagacity and penetration","Meridian, Newton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"D’Alembert, who rose to still higher celebrity, and contributed to distinguish the character of the age in which he lived, closely followed in this research, though by a different path; en¬ countered similar difficulties, obtained the same partial result, but finally arrived at a like sa¬ tisfactory conclusion. He carried his acute¬ ness and penetration into all the abstruse de¬ partments of physics, and marked his progress by originality of conoeption. The success of this most ingenious philosopher would have been more complete, if he had confined his views to the pursuits of abstract science. But he wanted that patience to which Newton, with innate mo¬ desty, ascribed all his advantages. In discussing the most arduous questions, D’Alembert advan¬ ced generally by new paths, and displayed great resources and much versatility of talent. He would seldom retouch his formulae, or seek to mould them into simplicity and elegance, and never submitted to the labour of reducing them to actual application. Ambitious to excel in literature as in science, he transferred into his miscellaneous compositions the same strict logic and nice discrimination which guided his analy¬ tical researches, and likewise contracted a cor¬ responding style, remarkable for the qualities of precision and clearness, but possessing no warmth or elevation",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But a succession of minor discoveries continued to expand and consolidate every department of Natural Philosophy. Daniel Bernoulli, the most amiable, if not the most ingenious of that shin¬ ing family, embraced with candour the doctrine of Newton, and likewise evinced, in all his phy¬ sical researches, a considerable share of the sa¬ gacity and singular address which so eminently distinguished that great master. The attention of Lambert was diverted to a wide variety of pur¬ suits, and his original and excursive mind shed new lights on every subject it explored. He conjoined analytical skill with the talent of ex¬ perimental research. But unfortunately he con¬ tented himself in operating with rude instru¬ ments, and commonly trusted to the probability of rectifying such imperfect results by the help of combined calculations. If Mayer had not the same reach and versatility of genius, he pos¬ sessed that inciting ardour and unconquerable perseverance which enabled his discrimination to erect a durable monument. Adopting the clear formulae of Euler for the several elements of the moon’s motions, he deduced the indeter¬ minate co-efficients from a strict and most labo¬ rious comparison of Bradley’s observations, and by thus poising and adjusting the numerical quantities, he framed a body of Lunar Tables, which has long been regarded as a standard of excellence. It is thus that England has generally supplied the means which rendered the conclu¬ sions of the Continental mathematicians really available. The reflecting instrument of Hadley, the achromatic glass of Dolland, and the divid¬ ing machine of Ramsden, have, in succession, mightily contributed to the progress of practi¬ cal astronomy. The numerous observations of Bradley and Maskelyne furnished the correct data which guided Lagrange, Laplace, and Gauss, through all their profound researches, to the dis¬ covery of the cyclical and reciprocating motions of the heavenly bodies. The various disturbing causes incessantly in operation are, after the lapse of certain vast periods, again renewed and repeat¬ ed in the same order of succession, and thus pre¬ serve the fine harmony, and maintain the per¬ manent stability, of the Universal System","Newton, Bradley, Bradley, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"Emancipated from the trammels of a narrow notation, the more aspiring votaries pursue with ardour the most refined calculus; while they guide its application and avoid its abuse by the infusion of that spirit of purity and elegance de¬ rived from the discipline of the ancient geome¬ try. Among the illustrious few whom foreign nations would adopt with distinction, we may cite the gifted individual who, rivalling the fame of Lagrange and Laplace, has, in his beautiful solution of the problem of the Attrac¬ tion of Spheroids, struck out a new and direct path, which completely throws into the shade their very laborious and perplexed trains of in¬ vestigation",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

But a more extensive undertaking was planned by our oriental traveller Bernard, to print at Ox¬ ford a complete series of the Greek Geometers, filling up the blanks from the inspection of Arabic Manuscripts. In pursuance of this scheme, Hr David Gregory2 edited Euclid, and Dr Halley3 Apollonius, while he restored like¬ wise the Tracts on the Section of Ratio and of Space.

There he resided till his health became impaired, and in 1681 he retired to the calmer enjoyment of his native country. The same pursuits, however, engaged his attention, till his death at the Hague on the 8th of June 1695.

He overcame the scruples of the modest philosopher, and prevailed with him to arrange the materials of the Principia, of which he superintended the pub¬ lication in 1687, having written the preface and some elegant recommendatory verses. Halley now gave a geometrical construction of the higher equations, computed the effects of evaporation in the IMediterranean, and formed tables of life annuities. For the purpose of improving Nautical Science, he had the command of the Paramour Pink, with which he sailed from England on the 24th November 1698, traversed the Atlantic, and crossed the Equinoxial Line; but his crew growing sick and mutinous, he was obliged to return in the following June. Invested with fuller powers, he set sail again in September, and spent twelve months in exploring both hemispheres, and during the year after his return, he delineated and published his famous magnetical chart. He was next employed on a survey of the British Channel, and^ then sent by the English Government to assist her ally the Emperor of Germany in forming a harbour at the bottom of the Adriatic",Newton,"DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"On his return he was appointed, in November 1703, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, having been thwarted before in a similar canvass by clerical influence. He now set about recovering the works of Apollonius ; studied as much Arabic as enabled him to translate the tract on the Section of Ratio, and he restored the other tract on the Section of Space from the hints left by Pappus. These pieces, in a small octavo volume, appeared in 1706; but four years afterwards came forth, in a splendid folio, his edition of the Conics, with the eighth book restored, and the additional treatise of Serenus. In 1719 Halley was appointed astronomer royal, and resided at Greenwich during the rest of his life, devoting his advanced age to the careful and assiduous observation of the Heavens. He completed even his projected task of embracing a lunar period of eighteen years. A paralytic disorder seized him in 1737, from which he partially recovered, but his strength declined insensibly, and he expired on the’ 14th of January 1742. Few philosophers have contributed more largely to the advance¬ ment of useful knowledge. Ingenuity, ardour, indefatigable perseverance, learning, and general information, were pos¬ sessed by Dr Halley in a most eminent degree; and having mingled in the active scenes of life, he had the rare advantage of conjoining the love of study with the habits of social intercourse",Oxford,US,8,United States,North America
"longer preserved in Italy and in England than over the rest of Europe. But no person evei cultivated that fine science with more assiduity, perseverance, and success, than our countryman Dr Robert Simson1 of Glasgow, the learned and critical editor of Euclid’s Elements. In this department he concentrated his whole efforts, and appears, from his familiarity with the ancient mode of demonstration, to have inhaled the very spirit of the Greeks. In 1749, he published his Restoration of the books of Apollonius on Plane Loci, which by its fulness and peculiar elegance leaves scarcely a shadow of regret for the loss of the original. Simson pursued his researches in the Ancient Analysis through a long life, and not only restored various frag¬ ments, but threw light on some very difficult and abstruse questions connected with it. A posthumous volume, printed in 1776, at the ex¬ pence of Earl Stanhope, besides many fine geo¬ metrical speculations, contains the first satisfac¬ tory exposition of Porisms, of which the defini¬ tion advanced by Pappus had been commonly regarded as an incomprehensible enigma. But from the unvarying tenor of his studies, the Scotch professor became a rigorist for the An¬ cient Analysis, and rejected with disdain the most obvious improvements in the form of exhibition","Glasgow, Euclid","IT,GB,US",8,"Italy,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Dr Matthew Stewart3 of Edinburgh, who had been the pupil of Dr Simson, and possessed a X Born at Kirtonhall in Ayrshire on 14th October 1687, studied at Glasgow, and made such progress in elementary geo¬ metry that at the early a""e of 22 he had an offer of the professorship of mathematics, which was immediately expected to be¬ come vacant in that University. Feeling his deficiency, however, he obtained leave of a year’s absence, which he spent in London under the tuition of Humphry Ditton, and was admitted to the chair on the 20th of November 1711. His time seems afterwards to have been mostly spent in discharging the duties of his office, the intervals being allotted to the solution of geometrical problems, the perusal of the older mathematicians, and to miscellaneous reading. He led the life of a recluse, and all his steps were formal and methodical; yet his disposition was amiable, and he indulged at stated times in easy conviviality. He sent two papers, geometrical and algebraical, on Indeterminate Problems, to the Royal Society m 1723 and 1753, gave his restoration of the Loci Plani in 1745, published his Conic Sections in 1735, produced the Latin edition of Euclid’s Elements in a quarto volume in 1756, which he compressed in 1760 into an English octavo, to which he annexed the data in 1762. It contains only the first six books of the original, with the eleventh and twelfth, the rest of the books being omitted as of little consequence in the present state of science. Perhaps the selection should have been carried far¬ ther. This edition is correct and creditable to the compiler, and has obtained prodigious success. -^'ay5 6ie veiy Scotti¬ cisms with which it abounds appear now to be adopted at Oxford and Cambridge as the appropiiate diction of the Ancient Geometry. Simson quite idolized his original. He had a fine taste for geometry, some talents of invention, and consider¬ able attainments as a scholar, but without any great force of intellect. In his latter years, from excessive veneration of the Greek Geometry, he not only viewed the Cartesian method with aversion, but began to regard the I luxionary Calculus with mistrust and suspicion. He became emeritus professor in 1761, and died on the 1st of October 1768","Edinburgh, Born, Glasgow, University, London, Euclid, Oxford, Cambridge","US,GB,NL,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Netherlands,N/A","North America,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"2 Born in 1717 at Rothsay, in the Isle of Bute, of which place his father was minister ; studied seven years at Glasgow, where he distinguished himself; to gain farther instruction, in 1741 he removed to Edinburgh, wheie he cultivated the society of the celebrated Maclaurin, while he corresponded with Simson, his old master. He now prosecuted geometrical studies with ardour, and put forth his uncommon powers of invention ; and after he became minister at Roseneath, he found leisure in that seclusion to continue his favourite pursuits. On the occasion of a vacancy of the mathematical chair at Edin¬ burgh by the death of Maclaurin, he was induced to draw out the substance of his most profound geometrical investigations, which he printed under the title of General Theorems, in a small volume, about the close of 1746. This publication se¬ cured his election, and after some delay he was appointed professor in September 1747- He now enjoyed a situation most congenial to his taste, and favourable to the exercise of his rare talents. Ambitious to apply his beloved geometry to un¬ ravel questions which were believed to demand all the resources of algebraic art, he discovered a solution of Kepler s pro¬ blem at once simple and direct, and greatly surpassing in beauty the more laboured efforts of calculation. . This investi¬ gation was inserted in the second volume of the Transactions of the Edinburgh Society, which appeared in 1/56. En¬ couraged by such success, he five years afterwards produced his Physical and Mathematical Tracts ; a very ingenious and elegant work, which would have been clearer had the author only admitted an abbreviation by the simpler algebraic symbols. About this time the results of the observations of the Transit of Venus, which had been expected to give the true distance of the Sun, were found to be unsatisfactory and discordant. Stewart therefore published in 1763, as a sequel to his Tracts, a theoretical solution of the problem; in which he was directed by Geometry to the exact motion of the Lunar Apogee, a question that, since the analysis of Newton, had perplexed the greatest mathematicians. . But he was not equally felicitous in Determining the Solar Distance, which required the inversion of the problem, and involved some deceitful and precarious compensations of error. This pamphlet was his last production, having printed only a few months before an octavo volume under the title of Propositiones More Veterum Demonstrates. These propositions^ however, derive their value merely as exercises of the method of conducting geometrical analysis and synthesis. But his lamp of genius was already nearly extinguished. Dr Stewart fell into a state of bad health, and having devolved the charge of teaching on his son, then a youth of the highest promise, he retired in 1772 to a small paternal property in Ayrshire, w here he chiefly spent the rest of his days, and died on the 23d of January 1785","Born, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newton","GB,NL,US",8,"United Kingdom,Netherlands,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"It would seem that, in finding the square root, the Greek mathematicians must have employed certain methods of abbreviation which are not explained. Archimedes, in his famous Quadra¬ ture of the Circle, to which he approximated by measuring the successive inscribed and circum¬ scribing polygons, having occasion repeatedly to extract the square root, expressed the value by fractions, and yet with such felicity as always to adopt the lowest integral numerator and de¬ nominator. He thus discovered that the cir¬ cumference of a circle is less than 3} times and greater than 3^ times its diameter, or that their ratio lies between the ratios 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223.1 This approximation within the limits of the 2000th and 4000th parts, might be suffi¬ cient for ordinary practice. But Apollonius and Ptolemy afterwards approached a hundred times nearer. Yet no farther advances were made in solving that important problem, which re¬ quired the most refined address, till the lapse of near a thousand years, when the Arabians be¬ came possessed of the denary system of notation, and carried the expression for the circumference of a circle to ten decimal places. But this elabo¬ rate result was imperfectly known to the revi¬ vers of science in Europe ; and Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and others, exerted their ingenuity and patience in extending the earlier solution. The simplest and most elegant is that of 113 to 355, an approximation differing scarcely by the ten millionth part from the truth, which was disco¬ vered about the year 1585 by the elder Adrian Metius, a military engineer in Holland. His countrymen Van Keulen and Snellius, in the next century, pushed the expression for the cir¬ cumference of the circle to 35 figures. But the progress of the higher analysis opened more easy and rapid modes of approximation. In the early part of the eighteenth century, Sharp2 and Ma- 1 This ratio, it may be observed, is easily derived from the limits assigned bv Archimedes, for 71 + 7x 6 = 113, and 223 + 22x6 = 355","Adrian, Holland","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"Many important additions have been made to the digest of Euclid; and several eminent ma¬ thematicians of the eighteenth century have cor¬ rected, simplified, and essentially improved the only valuable portion of the large work.5 Some 1 John Machin, elected professor of Astronomy in Gresham College in 1713, and became secretary of the Royal Society",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America
"The works now mentioned might suffice for the instruction of practical or professional men; but the pursuit of a liberal education aspires to greater attainments. The main object is to sharpen the faculty of perception, and invigorate by due exercise the tone of the intellectual powers. For contributing to that effect, the fulness and circumspection of the an¬ cient mode of demonstration are admirably calculated. It seemed, therefore, an estimable task to select the scattered wrecks of the Greek Analysis, and dispose them into a form accessible to ordinary students. The beauty of the pro¬ positions concerning Loci was particularly striking. _ _ . . „ It ivould be preposterous, however, to hold up the Elements of Euclid as a standard of instruction in Geometry for the present day. They were composed before the invention of Trigonometry, and probably designed chiefly as an introduction to the Pvthagorean Philosophy. Hence the large portion of them devoted to the relations of numbers, and the properties of the regular polygons and solids. By common consent, therefore, the greater part of the system is now laid aside, and the other boohs are commonly altered or curtailed in practice. Many trivial propositions occur in the third bookseveral of the fourth have little interest; and it may abate that extravagant praise which several mathematicians have lavished on the Doctrine of Proportion contained in the fifth book, to know that it really cannot be taught. But the language em¬ ployed in that celebrated compilation, for want of appropriate technical terms, is often vague and indistinct Ihe word angle, for instance, has no less than three different significations; and other examples of a like confusion might be easily cited. In some cases, the demonstrations of Euclid are imperfect or inconclusive. Thus, the reasoning in the twenty- fourth proposition of the first book applies only to the particular position of the figure; an objection first started by Ihomas Simpson, to the great annoyance of his critical namesake. But similar oversight was made in the demonstration of the seventh proposition of the same book, which fails if the figure be changed. Both these propositions are only of conse¬ quence as auxiliaries in the train of combination. But of the fundamental property of parallel lines, the demonstration rests on the mere assumption of an intricate axiom. In a few cases the reasoning is unnecessarily complicated, from the peculiar conceptions of the author. Thus, the noted fifth proposition of the first book is of that description. Its demon¬ stration implies the reversed application, at least mentally, of the isosceles triangle; but Euclid evades or disguises the pro¬ cess, by producing the sides of the triangle, and forming two interwoven triangles, which are virtually adapted by inver¬ sion, and the annexed triangles being then taken away, the equality of the angles at the base hence follows- But the last is the only step wanted, and the other two were evidently superfluous. This stumbling proposition has been called the Pons Asinorum; and no wonder that the beginner should feel puzzled at seeing such a parade of argument end in so plain a result","Euclid, Euclid, Euclid",US,8,United States,North America
"The more comprehensive relation of the dis¬ tances of any point in the curve from a focus and the directrix is mentioned by Pappus, but the beauty of that locus was not perceived till Boscovich, in 1752, deduced the properties of those lines from it in a string of corollaries, more ingenious than elegant. This essay was compressed and methodized by Thomas New¬ ton in 1794; and in the same year Walker, a respectable mathematician, unaware of what had been already done, produced a work on a similar plan, of which the first part occupied a quarto volume, composed indeed after the man¬ ner of the ancients, but so exceedingly prolix in diction as to have very few readers",Walker,US,8,United States,North America

"To express large numbers by continued addi¬ tions being impossible, it soon became neces¬ sary to arrange them on a scale of ascending progression. The simplest mode was evidently to repeat the same root of the scale; and as men in the earlier periods of society used to reckon with the ten fingers of both hands, they were led by Nature herself to frame the Denary Sys¬ tem of Numeration. If they had likewise form¬ ed marks for a Digital Notation, they would have completed the bases of Arithmetic. But un¬ fortunately the Alphabetic Characters had been introduced before distinct symbols were con¬ trived to represent numbers. The letters design¬ ed merely for written language, came hence among all nations to be employed besides in numeral notation, though hardly manageable, and ill adapted to any regular system of arrange¬ ment. In the application of those characters the ancient Greeks showed great ingenuity, by distinguishing them into three classes, appropri¬ ated to the ascending progression of units, tens, and hundreds. In this way they reached the term of a thousand, and by employing as an auxiliary the capital M, they could indicate myriads or ten thousands. The triple series of thousands up to a million were more easily denoted, however, by placing a dash under the successive sections of letters. But Archi¬ medes indicated a mode of obtaining almost un¬ bounded extension of this system, by decompos¬ ing the elements of the notation into periods of ascending myriads. Apollonius simplified the plan, by adopting a thousand as the root of the progressive scale. Had he proceeded only a little farther, and rejected the letters, except the first class denoting digits, he would have render¬ ed his notation perfect, and have achieved one of the most useful and prolific discoveries ever made. Ptolemy afterwards advanced much nearer to this ultimate object, by employing, in his Trigonometrical Tables, the descending Sexagesi¬ mal Scale, suggested by the subdivision of the cir¬ cumference of a circle into degrees, of which or the root of this scale, correspond nearly to the length of the radius. It would seem, however, that, during the interval between Archimedes and Ptolemy, the Greek Arithmetic had receiv¬ ed some essential improvements in practice; for the Sicilian geometer, by a very tedious and operose process, of which he gives merely the re¬ sults, was content with stating the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle as in¬ termediate between that of 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223, differing therefore by a 1200th part from the truth; whereas the chords computed by the astronomer of Alexandria for every half degree of the semicircle are correct to the last place, and consequently never deviate by a 300,000th part of the whole",Alexandria,US,8,United States,North America
"with the tedious and operose methods of calculation then practised among engineers, he sought to shorten the road by recur- ring to general principles and the aid of Geometry. Thinking closely on that subject, he matured a regular system, which has changed the theory of planes and solids. The ardour of his pursuits was infused into his pupils, and the frequent com¬ munications he made to learned societies rapidly extended his fame. In 1780 he was conjoined with Bossut as acting pro¬ fessor ot Hydrodynamics at the Louvre, a place erected by the patriotic minister Turgot, which required him to reside at Paris only during half the year. But three years afterwards, on being appointed to succeed Bezout as Examiner of the Marine, he fixed his permanent abode in the capital, and engaged in the experiments and discussions of the philosophers",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"The discovery of the Denary Notation, so beau¬ tiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to India, though neither the place nor the date of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic nu¬ merals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathe¬ maticians are now found, from examination of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new sys¬ tem ot notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in Spain, whence it was slow¬ ly communicated to the several Christian States over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs com¬ piled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly pur¬ chased by the various monasteries and convents throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transac¬ tions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of sexagesimals. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the prac¬ tice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regio¬ montanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly em¬ ployed. To count downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards. But the mode of denoting the ranks of decimals was then most cumbrous, the successive numerals, like the in¬ dices in Algebra, being inclosed in small circles",University,"ES,IN,US",8,"Spain,India,United States","Europe,Asia,North America"
"to compute them.1 Perfect numbers, or such as may be composed by the addition of their aliquot parts, could not fail to excite admira¬ tion ; and Euclid produced an elegant theorem for discovering them. It is remarkable that these numbers should appear frequent at first in the series, and afterwards occur only at wide inter¬ vals. Thus, below 10,000, there are four perfect numbers; but the last of the succeeding four includes no fewer than nineteen ciphers.2 The moderns have advanced farther, and imagined what are called Amicable numbers, on all which subjects Euler has shown his ingenuity and un¬ rivalled analytical skill",Euclid,US,8,United States,North America

"But his austere occupation did not divert him from the nobler pursuits of philosophy and science ; and being appointed by the Parliamentary commissioners in 1649, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, he continued regularly to discharge the duties of that office.. He had afterwards some hot disputes with Hobbes, who, though a most ingenious metaphysician, unfortunately mistook his own blunders for discoveries in Mathematics. Wallis maintained a large correspondence with men of science, and assiduously contributed to the progress of philosophical discovery during that active period. The mo¬ deration of his character assured him the possession .of the places he held at the Restoration ; and though he found leisure to compose a very learned philosophical grammar of the English language, and sometimes indulged his early taste for con¬ troversial divinity, he devoted the greater part of a long life to the laborious cultivation and extension of the various de¬ partments of Mathematical Science.

"His Elements of Trigonometry was the completes! treatise in English at the period of its appearance. He afterwards im¬ proved the solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations, and illustrated the methods of approximating to the resolution of equations in general. But the most important service he rendered to mathematical science consists in reprinting at great expence, and chiefly for distribution, the series of original authors in logarithms, with ample annotations, in six large quarto volumes. From his anxiety to be perspicuous, he was apt to fall into the opposite extreme of tiresome prolixity.' The grandfather of Maseres was an officer in the French guards, born in the district of Bearn, and a Hugonot, who, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, retired to Holland, and transferring his services to the Prince of Orange, accompa¬ nied the Preserver of our liberties into England, and fought by his side in Ireland. The grandson having embraced the profession of the law, was soon after the peace of 1763, probably on account of his intimate acquaintance with French lan¬ guage and customs, appointed Attorney General of Quebec, where he resided till 1770. At leaving his charge, he visited Boston and New York, while that agitation was fermenting which burst into open revolt. Soon after his return to Eng¬ land, he published in successive volumes his Canadian Free/iolder, in which he refuted the despotic maxims of Lord Mans¬ field, and earnestly recommended conciliatory measures with our American colonies. But it was a time of infatuation and disaster. Maseres by his firmness gave mortal offence to the courtiers, and never obtained any promotion, farther than the small sinecure office of Cursitor Baron of Exchequer. But fortune had abundantly provided for all his wants, and he enjoyed unbroken health, and the renovating pleasures of study and social intercourse. The Baron had composed a full and learned treatise on Life Annuities, and matured a plan for securing small pensions from Government to such of the poorer classes as should make certain contributions during the vigour of their days. This he embodied in a Bill which passed the Commons, but was lost in the House of Lords, through the influence of the Bishops, who seem to have consi¬ dered pauperism as a right appendage to their splendid ecclesiastic establishment.

"The publication of the Geometry of Descartes in 1637 is justly deemed an epoch in the his¬ tory of analytical science. The capacious mind of the author seized on all the preceding disco¬ veries, and moulded them with his original in¬ ventions into a regular and comprehensive sys¬ tem. He gave rapidity to the writing of Al¬ gebra by the introduction of small characters, and rendered the distinction more palpable be¬ tween known and unknown quantities, by the appropriation of the initial and final letters of the alphabet. He adopted the notation of the integral exponents or indices, as reduced to its simplest form by Herigon; and this appa¬ rently very slight improvement led, in the se¬ quel, to the most important results. Though the index was at first merely a contraction for the repeating of the same letter in the involution of powers, yet it acquired a most extensive im¬ port when it came to be treated abstractly as a number. The prefixing of the subtractive sign changed the expression into its reciprocal, and the substituting of a fraction converted it into the symbol of evolution or the extraction of roots. Nothing can better illustrate the effi¬ ciency of a systematic notation, as an instru¬ ment for enabling the intellect to pursue and generalize its deductions, than the successive modifications which analogy suggested in the marking of exponents, during the short period from Descartes to Newton",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In the latter part of the seventeenth, and du¬ ring the course of the eighteenth century, Al¬ gebra still continued to advance; and though it underwent no revolution, it acquired greater perfection in all its details. The construction of cubic and biquadratic equations, which Des¬ cartes had effected by combining a circle with a parabola, was afterwards improved; but Newton proposed the Conchoid as the curve best adapted for the practical solution of such problems",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Leibnitz succeeded in conquering the irreducible case of Cardan, by a bold application of the bi¬ nomial theorem, having converted the cubic roots of the compound expressions into two se¬ ries, with alternate imaginary terms, which are extinguished by their conjunction. In examin¬ ing generally the nature of cubic equations, their solution came afterwards to be referred to the trisection of a Circular or Hyperbolic Sector, and was therefore accomplished by the application of a table either of Sines or of Logarithms. The theory of the Section of Angles and of Ratios, founded by the ingenuity of Cotes, furnished a clue to the resolution of certain forms of the Higher Equations. But though Euler solved biquadratics in a different way from that of Descartes, all attempts to find directly the roots of tbe fifth and the superior orders of equations had totally failed. It became necessary therefore to have recourse to the approximative methods of resolving equations. Successive improve¬ ments in the process of calculation were made by Raphson, Halley, Lagny, and Taylor; so that little seemed wanting for any practical end",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America
"About the years 1714 and 1718, Montmort1 and James Bernoulli employed it in the investiga¬ tion of the Laws of Chance. But De Moivre,2 a French refugee, and a man of learning and pro¬ found science, carried these researches much farther, having devoted his time professionally to the calculation .of probabilities, and of the values of life-annuities. In 1730, he published an original work, which, besides other useful in¬ ventions, explained the properties of a Recurring Series, that always repeats the same succession of co-efficients in distinct sequences. About the same time, Stirling3 brought out a complete treatise on Series, in which he advanced by a different road to consider their convergence, in¬ terpolation, and summation.

"The composition of equations was at the same time investigated with more address and preci¬ sion. The rule for distinguishing the positive and negative roots from the alternating signs, which Descartes had merely stated, now received a strict demonstration by Segner. The mode of finding the impossible roots, or rather the quadratic factors, of an equation, which Newton probably had inferred from mere induction, was traced by Maclaurin to its real source. D’Alem¬ bert proved that every irrational expression is reducible to the form Ae =±: V — B2; or, in other words, that every compound expression of a higher order may he resolved either into simple or quadratic factors. This is the most impoit- ant conclusion perhaps relating to the nature of equations. But the general theory was never so clearly and completely discussed as by Gauss, in a small work published by him in 1779",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

He afterwards profited by the kind instructions of some mathematical friends, and found himself so far ad¬ vanced in science, that at the age of 25 he repaired to Cambridge, and established his fame in that university bv the warmth and splendour of his lectures on the Newtonian Philosophy. He was encouraged by the gentleness of Whiston, who saw no rival; and, on the ejection of that amiable enthusiast in 1711 for heresy or dogmatism, succeeded to the Lu¬ casian Professorship of Mathematics, the duties of which he continued henceforth to perform with zeal and assiduity.

"The superiority of its algorithm, joined to the ardour of his disciples and successors the Ber- noullis, gave it the complete possession of the Continent. But in England, the Method of Fluxions, now greatly in arrear, was cultivated only by a very few aspirants. Its inventor had vacillated about the notation he should adopt, and the unfortunate marking by points appeared the first time in one of the volumes of Dr Wallis’ works, printed in 1699.1 Newton had published nothing separately on the subject, till the Tract on Fluxions, drawn from the recesses of his closet, made its appearance in 1704; which, though full of ingenuity, was then decidedly imperfect and insufficient.

In January 1706, he was elected unanimously to the chair of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, which had been just founded by Archdeacon Plume. He took orders in 1713, and at the desire of Dr Bentley superin¬ tended the printing of the second edition of the Principia, to which he furnished a learned and ingenious preface. His genius and uncommon talents had raised the highest expectations, when a putrid fever snatched him away in the full tide of vigour, on the 5th of June 1716. Newton in his latter days used often to exclaim with a modest feeling of regret, “ If Cotes had lived we should have known something.” This very promising philosopher was perhaps rather fastidious; for, except a short but ingenious essay on Logarithms, he produced nothing of decided importance during his lifetime.

"715 after the retreat of Newton, could safely enter the lists with the Bernoullis. His most original work, the Methodus Incrementorum, published in 1715, unfolded the elements of the increase and decrease of a variable quantity or function. It was a fine extension of the Differential or Flux¬ ionary Calculus, and constituted a new and im¬ portant branch of the Higher Analysis, which has since received an appropriate algorithm, and acquired the appellation of Finite Differences",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But the notation employed was imperfect, con¬ sisting merely of accents instead of points; and the Tract, like other works of Taylor, affected a degree of brevity which borders on obscuri¬ ty. It was therefore elucidated by Nicole, an eminent French mathematician, in a series of able dissertations, between the years 1717 and 1727. The Taylorian Theorem itself has been successively modified, transformed, and extend¬ ed by Maclaurin, Lagrange, and Laplace, whose names are attached to their several formulae","Taylor, Laplace","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"The Integration of a class of Differential Equa¬ tions was proposed by Count Riccati, and solved in different ways by himself and the sons and nephews of the first Bernoullis. Manfredi1 in 1707 gave a skilful solution of differential equa¬ tions of the first degree; and in 1722, Vincent, the son of James Riccati, pursued likewise the same road. A curious kind of problems was started by Fagnano,2 another Italian Count, to determine those Elliptical or Hyperbolic Arcs, which have their difference expressed by an algebraical quantity. This led Euler, in 1756, to invent a very comprehensive method of deter¬ mining particular integrals, that Lagrange im¬ proved in 1766 and 1769, and which he himself again simplified in 1778. Our ingenious coun¬ tryman Landen has chanced to fall into a simi¬ lar train, having in 1775 converted the formula for the rectification of the Hyperbola into an¬ other which includes two arcs of an Ellipse, to¬ gether with an algebraical quantity. The rec¬ tification of the Ellipse has been since improved by Legendre and Ivory",Vincent,US,8,United States,North America
"variable quantities, from the relation merely of the Differential Co-efficients contained in their Complete Differential. The first specimen of this sort of Integration was given by Euler in 1734; hut D’Alembert expanded the process in his Discourse on the General Cause of Winds, which appeared in 1749. It was likewise em¬ ployed by both these illustrious mathematicians in the rigorous solution of the problem of the vibrating musical string, the position of any point in the harmonic curve depending evidently on the interval of time, as well as on the relation between the absciss and ordinate. But Euler left nothing unfinished. In 1762 he resumed the subject of Partial Differences, and gave a com¬ plete explication of its principles, embodying the mode of calculation by an appropriate Algo¬ rithm, in a memoir of the Petersburg Acts, en¬ titled, Investigatio functionum ex data differentia- lium conditione. But still further progress was made by him in the third volume of his immor¬ tal work on the Differential and Integral Cal¬ culus, which came out in 1770. Euler, having then advanced to differential equations of the second order, digested the whole doctrine of Partial Differences into a clear and systematic form. Yet several important additions and im¬ provements have been since contributed to this intricate subject by Lagrange and Laplace, by Nieuport and Trembley",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"*7 1 ’T / u first proposed by Newton, and from which he framed the terms Fluxions and Fluents, appears, on the whole, very clear and satisfactory; nor should the metaphysical objection of introducing ideas of motion into Geometry have much weight",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Maclaurin was induced, however, by such cavil¬ ling, to devote half a volume to an able but superfluous discussion of this question. As a re¬ finement on the ancient process of Exhaustions, the noted method of Prime and Ultimate Ratios, or of the Relations of Vanishing or Evanescent Quantities, which Newton preferred in the Prin- cipici) deserves the highest praise for accuracy of conception. It has been justly commended by D’Alembert, who expounded it copiously, and adopted it as the basis of the Higher Calculus",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The method of Analytical or Derivative Func¬ tions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work ; the same subject having been Heated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor’s theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But La¬ grange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of Infinitesimals or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubt¬ ed whether, with all his ingenuity, he has at¬ tained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calcu¬ lation, would almost spontaneously regard a pro¬ cess of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument. But though the method of Derivations should not possess that logical supe¬ riority over the Fluxionary or Differential Calcu- 1 Benjamin Itobins, born of Quaker parents at Bath in 1707- He discovered early and powerful talents, which he im¬ proved with intense ardour, and soon emancipated himself from the trammels of his cold and narrow sect. Mathematics were his favourite study, but he enriched his mind by a course of extensive reading and the pursuit of general information. He became a successful teacher of those sciences in London, and turned his attention to their practical application. Having cultivated also the art of writing, he distinguished himself by several controversial pieces m science, and even assisted by his pen the opposition to Walpole’s administration. He was now so well known as a clever writer as to be employed in correcting Walter’s account of Anson’s Voyage round the World; but finding the performance very poor, he re-composed the whole. The appearance of this celebrated work in 1748 secured the patronage of the Admiral, and he was appointed Engineer General to the East India Company. He sailed from England at Christmas 1749, and on his arrival in India began immediately the fortifications at Madras ; but he fell a sacrifice to that baneful climate on the 29th July 1751.

Having completed the usual course of education, and turned his thoughts in 1693 to the medical profession, he took a degree in j)hysic. He now travelled into France, and spent some time at the country-seat of the Marquis de I’Hopital, whom he taught the New Calculus. Proceeding next to Holland, he was appointed in 1695 Professor of Medicine and Mathematics (for these sciences were strangely conjoined) in the University of Groningen. The fame he there acquired by his lectures and writings appears to have awakened the jealousy or bigotry of the Calvinistic clergy, who brought a serious charge against him, for impugning the doctrine of the resurrection in a Thesis maintained by one of his scholars, and composed or corrected bv himself, which represented the body as in a state of continual mutation, not only the liquid, but even the solid parts being successively absorbed and renewed, and no particle of the composition remaining after a very short term of years. The coolness of the magistrates, however, effectually silenced the ignorant clamour of the Synod, and Bernoulli was pressed to remain in Holland, with flattering offers of promotion. But Bernoulli preferred his native city, whither he was sponta¬ neously invited to succeed his brother. In this honourable station he spent the rest of a long life in extending, by the ac¬ tivity of his genius, every branch of Mathematical and Physical Science.

"The slightest incident has often led to the most interesting discoveries. Few would sup¬ pose that the spinning of a common top in¬ volves the most diflicult conditions in Dyna¬ mics, and serves to explain all the intricacies of the planetary vertiginous motions. Segner, a celebrated professor of mathematics at Got¬ tingen, and afterwards at Halle, and a man of original and independent mind, published, in 1755, a short dissertation, with the modest title of Specimen Theorice Turbinum, wherein he show¬ ed that every body having a determinate figure, which after combined impulsions is abandoned in free space, will, besides its progressive mo¬ tion, perform simultaneously, and without the smallest interference, a constant and uniform re¬ volution about each of three principal axes mu¬ tually perpendicular, and passing through the centre of gravity. These axes of rotation possess some beautiful but abstruse properties, which the pulse of native genius burst through constraint, and hurried him into the ardent pursuit of geometry and astronomy, which he cultivated in private. Alluding to this circumstance, he chose for his device Phaethon driving the chariot of the Sun, with the motto, “ Invito patre sidera verso."" He began his travels for information in 1676, visited Geneva, traversed France, and eagerly sought the society of men of learning and science. In 1680 he descended to the Netherlands and Hol¬ land, passed over to F.ngland, and frequented the philosophical meetings in London. .After his return home m 1632, he gave a course of mechanical lectures, in which he exhibited the new discoveries. Being appointed Professor of Mathe¬ matics in 1687, the fame of his vast attainments drew crowds of strangers to the academy. His genius was a torch of illu¬ mination, and the most elegant simplicity distinguished all his profound inventions. In conjunction with his younger bro¬ ther, he not onlv found out the secret of the Differential Calculus, on which Leibnitz had given a very short and obscure essay in the Leipsic Acts, but unfolded the principles with such superior talent and address, that the German philosopher had the generosity to regard him as entitled to share in the honour of the great discovery. He pursued the Aew Calculus with extreme ardour, and applied it most happily to a variety of arduous investigations: He greatly improved the Method of Series, extended the Theory of Curve Lines, approximated to the rectification of the Parabola, and discovered man% beautiful properties of cycloids, epicycloids, and spirals. With the logarithmic spiral, which he discovered to renovate itself by evolution, his fancy was so much struck, that, in imitation of Archimedes, but in allusion to the sublime prospect of resurrection, when he should “ shuffle off this mortal coil,” and rise like Phoenix from her ashes, he directed with a fine enthusiasm this curve to be inscribed on his tomb, with the Ovidian line, “ Eadem mutata resurgo. . , But such nrightv strides required proportional exertion of intellect, and this intense and unremitting applrcatron under¬ mined the constitution of Bernoulli, and carried him to a premature grave. He sunk under a, slow fever on the 16th Au¬ gust 1705.

"The Boscovichian System assumed the gene¬ ral principle, that every substance whatever is capable of contraction and dilatation. But this was not admitted at the time in its full extent, the noted experiment of the Florentine Acade¬ micians seeming to have established the abso¬ lute incompressibility of water. The conclusion however was too hastily drawn; for though the liquid included within a hollow sphere of gold resisted the blows of a hammer, and burst the shell, yet the celerity with which it spirted through the crevice, only displayed the elastic force resulting, as Bellegradi rightly observed, from an expansive effort to recover its previous condition.

"1 John Canton, one of our most diligent, skilful, and accurate experimental philosophers, was born at Stroud in Glou¬ cestershire in 1718- His father, a broad-cloth weaver, bred him to the same trade; but the youth, incited by the lessons of an elementary teacher, had from his earliest years imbibed a taste for mathematical studies, and continued to devote every leisure moment to those fascinating pursuits. The ingenuity he showed in constructing sun-dials drew the notice of his more intelligent neighbours, who kindly fostered his efforts, and lent him instructive books. Nothing has contributed more in England, not only to spread general information, but to awaken latent genius, than the circulation of popular com- pendiums and dictionaries of science. With these aids the ardent application of Canton made such rapid and striking pro¬ gress, that his patrons counselled him to quit the loom and repair to the metropolis, the great mart of talent. In 1738 he was admitted assistant in a mathematical school in Spital Square, and afterwards became partner and successor in the con¬ cern, which he conducted during the rest of his life. Without aspiring to the higher walks of science, he was active in the search of knowledge. He devised new experiments, and carefully repeated those in vogue; thus extending our acquaint¬ ance with Electricity, Magnetism, and some parts of Physical Chemistry.

"Assumptions become necessary for the sake of abbreviation, and the process of integration it¬ self is seldom if ever complete. The results drawn from such laborious researches are, after all this parade of rigid accuracy, to be viewed as only near approximations, which could often be at¬ tained by much easier means. It would there¬ fore be preferable in many cases to study the physical relations more closely, avoiding the abuse of abstract calculation, and to rest satis¬ fied with arriving at the conclusions by a sort of balance of errors. In the sober application of analysis, Daniel Bernoulli was singularly happy, guiding his steps always by the light of ex¬ periment and observation. And, since the result of the most elaborate investigation is very seldom better than a simple approximation, it seems more j udicious in such researches to lay the chief stress on the estimate of physical principles. After the most strenuous efforts of genius displayed during the eighteenth century, the theory of the motions of fluids has really not arrived at more precise conclusions than those first assigned by the penetration of Newton. Nay, so far from reaching any higher degree of perfection, some of the recondite speculations of Lagrange and Poisson, those particularly relating to the ex¬ tent and celerity of waves, and the general un- dulatory commotions in fluids, involve conse¬ quences which are palpably at variance with the known phaenomena of Nature. In such compli¬ cated investigations, the safest mode of proceed¬ ing is to follow the example of astronomers, who determine the co-efficients of the several analy¬ tical formulae, by the comparison of observations",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"For the sake of round numbers, he assumed 30 inches for the standard mercurial column, air at the surface having 800 times less density than water; and he made the elevation proportional to the difference of the logarithms of these co¬ lumns, the interval between 30 and 29 inches corresponding to 900 feet. This rule, drawn directly from theoretical considerations, was found to apply with tolerable accuracy to an ob¬ servation made a few years afterwards on the top of Snowdon. Newton generalized the pro¬ blem in his Principia, by taking into the esti¬ mate the decrease of gravity in receding from the centre of the earth, and arrived at the conclu¬ sion, that the densities of the higher strata of the atmosphere form a geometrical progression corresponding to the altitudes disposed in har¬ monic proportion. But this correction may be deemed superfluous in most cases of barometri¬ cal measurement",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"It was only wanted, therefore, to rectify the method of Halley, by trying it with observations made at great altitudes. But, for more than half a century afterwards, the subject of barometri¬ cal measurement was entirely neglected in Eng- 1 The demonstration, with its date, is given on a Dutch Almanac, now preserved in the Library of the University of Leyden, which, among other valuable notices, contains various microscopical observations, and a judicious parallel between Descartes and Bacon, whom he censures for his ignorance of Geometry, his violent opposition to the Copernican System, and his general inattention to the progress of physical and astronomical science",University,US,8,United States,North America
"The chief cause of the perplexity was owing to the variable influence of heat on the density of the air. No further improvement could there¬ fore be made till that effect had been ascertained, and the difference of temperature between the stations in every case measured by the applica¬ tion of an accurate thermometer. De Luc has the merit of reviving the subject, and of pur¬ suing his researches with ardour, skill, and per¬ severance.

"The construction of the thermometer engaged his particular attention. He tried alcohol, and various refined oils, and discovered their great defects. He was therefore induced to prefer mer¬ cury, which, besides other advantages, he found, by the methods practised by Renaldini and Brook Taylor, to possess the essential property of ex¬ panding very nearly equally with equal acces¬ sions of heat. Substituting that mineral fluid for the dilute spirit of wine, he merely corrected the divisions of Reaumur, reckoning the arbitrary number of eighty degrees from freezing to boil¬ ing water.

"The rules which Deluc inferred from nume¬ rous experiments and observations were pub¬ lished in 1772 in his able but very diffuse work entitled Recherches sur les Modifications de V At¬ mosphere. Two years afterwards they were re¬ duced to English measures, and simplified by Maskelyne and Horsley ; and the problem of barometrical measurement appears then to have excited much attention in our island.

Since that time little more improvement has been effected, though se¬ veral circumstances that modify the solution of the problem, especially the influence of humidity, might require to be reconsidered.

"In very narrow glass tubes, water and other li¬ quids will indeed stand considerably higher than the level. This curious fact was first distinctly noticed by Aggiunto, one of the leading mem¬ bers of the Academy del Cimento, who died at an early age. But the completest series of experi¬ ments on Capillary Action was made by our countryman Hauksbee. He proved that it is not affected by atmospheric pressure, and suc¬ ceeds equally well in vacuo; he showed the ascent of water and other liquids between prox¬ imate glass plates, and compared it with the rise in narrow tubes; and he ascertained the elevation to be always inversely as the width of the bore or the separation of the plates. He found the same property belongs to plates of marble and brass, and remarked the ascension of water in an open barometer tube crammed with fine ashes. Dr Brook Taylor likewise performed several ingenious experiments on this subject: Having joined two plates of glass at their vertical sides so as to form a sharp wedge, he dipped it in a sheet of water, and ob¬ served the liquid to rise and form a rectangular hyperbola; thus clearly exhibiting the relation of the ascent to the interval between the proximate surfaces. But he pursued the phaenomena of corpuscular attraction still farther, and measur¬ ed the adhesion of a disc of glass to water and mercury. Seventy years afterwards this in¬ quiry was resumed by the celebrated Guyton- Morveau, who endeavoured to ground upon it the chemical theory of Elective xAttraction. The attempt however was fallacious, because the force required to detach a disc of glass, marble, or metal, from a surface of water or mercury, is not a single effort, but combines the adhesion of the liquid particles to the solid with their cohe¬ sion to each other",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America
"At the mention of Dr Young’s name the historian must pause. None of our countrymen has ap¬ proached more nearly to the character of the ce¬ lebrated Dr Brook Taylor. Possessing the same ingenuity, extensive learning, varied accomplish¬ ments, and profound science, he combined like¬ wise a concise, hard, and sometimes obscure mode of stating his reasonings and calculations. He ma¬ nifested some chagrin at seeing Laplace, within a twelvemonth after, digress from the train of his Mecanique Celeste, to produce an analytical inves¬ tigation of the phsenomena of Capillary Action, so closely resembling his own in the general conclu¬ sions. The illustrious French Philosopher, over¬ looking the previous advances that had been made, and little solicitous about tracing physical princi¬ ples, trusted to his consummate skill in the process of calculation, and involved the subject in a maze of intricate and abstruse formula. The reflections drawn from Dr Young on that occasion were extremely j udicious, and deserve to be held up to view at present, when such a false taste pre¬ vails as threatens to involve the science of our island in specious mysticism. “ It must be con¬ fessed that, in this country, the cultivation of the higher branches of the Mathematics, and the in¬ vention of new methods of calculation, cannot be too much recommended to the generality of those who apply themselves to Natural Philosophy; but it is equally true, on the other hand, that the first mathematicians on the Continent have ex¬ erted great ingenuity in involving the plainest truths of mechanics in the intricacies of Alge¬ braical formulas, and in some instances have even lost sight of the real state of an investigation, by attending only to the symbols, which they have employed for expressing its steps.” [Lectures on Natural Philosophy, vol. II. p. 670.) Laplace’s intricate formula for Capillary Action has been since unravelled by the acute discrimi¬ nation of Mr Ivory, who disjoined it into two separate portions; the one depending on the ad¬ hesion of the watery film to the inside of the tube, and the other resulting from half the cohesion of the particles of the liquid to each other. But our ingenious countryman deduced these ele¬ ments of the complete force from the simplest physical principles, availing himself of the pro¬ perty of equable diffusion of pressure through the mass of a fluid. The same investigation gave the measure and limits of depression observ¬ ed in mercury and some other liquids.

"About the year 1720 he gave a catalogue of bo¬ dies, which show electricity on being rubbed by the hand, including most substances, except the metals which he could not excite. But in 1732 he was led by a chain of accidents to discover the conducting property inherent in certain bodies, by which they are distinguished from such as may become electrical. The fundamental facts thus elicited were in 1739 arranged perspicu¬ ously by Besaguliers, who framed the inter¬ changeable epithets Conductors and Non-electrics, and Non-conductors and Electrics, and proposed the term Insulation to denote the interrupted communication of electrical virtue. In the mean¬ while Dufay,2 keeper of the King’s Garden at Paris, availing himself of these discoveries, ad¬ vanced in the investigation with a keener and more philosophical spirit. Between the years 1733 and 1739 he detected two opposite kinds of electricity, which he called the Vitreous and the Resinous, the former being excited by rub¬ bing glass, crystal, and other kindred substances, and the latter by the friction of amber, lac, rosin, &c.; and he gave a clear view of the phsenomena of electrical attraction and repulsion, by demon¬ strating that bodies similarly electrified mu¬ tually repel, while those dissimilarly electrified attract each other",Paris,US,8,United States,North America

It lienee acquired the appellation oi the Leyden Phial or Jar, and consists of a jar or plate of glass cover¬ ed or coated on both sides, to near the top or edge, by a metallic leaf or other conducting sur¬ face, which renders it capable of holding a very high charge of accumulated electricity. By this wonderful invention, a power was obtained in¬ comparably greater than any former exhibition of electrical influence. The shock or convulsive agitation accompanying the discharge of a loaded jar through the nervous system, at first inspired terror, and still continues to excite surprise and astonishment. The swiftness of electrical com¬ munication thus displayed seemed to exceed the rapidity of thought itself. Nollet,1 a popular lecturer on Experimental Philosophy at Paris, sent the shock with instantaneous effect through a whole regiment of guards; and Watson,2 an in¬ genious physician in London, could discover no interval of time in its transmission by a circuit of about six miles, formed partly by a wire, but mostly by the course of the river Thames","Paris, London","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"Various attempts were now made to explain the electrical phaenomena. The ordinary class ol philosophers had so long indulged the belief of ethereal media, that they were easily induced to ascribe the powers of electricity to the agency ot such a subtile fluid, which might seem at length revealed to our observation. Dufay showed that the electrical machine draws its supply from the ground, and Watson advanced a step farther, in assuming that every substance naturally holds a certain share of the fluid, which in a charged jar is redundant on the one side and deficient on the other, or distributed in a positive and negative state. The credit of inventing this Theory has been assigned to the celebrated Franklin,3 who might probably without communication have hit on the same idea, and is certainly entitled to the merit of expounding it in a clear and interesting manner. The shrewd American, without pos¬ sessing any superlative talents, or the advantages of education, had, by industry, judgment, and perseverance, raised himself to a conspicuous sta¬ tion in society. Having some tincture of science, and a taste for experiments, he was peculiarly for¬ tunate in choosing a subject of inquiry which so well accorded with the pitch of his acquirements",Franklin,US,8,United States,North America
"He had repeatedly visited England, and after his return to America he maintained a constant inter¬ change of letters with his friend Peter Collinson, a wealthy grocer in London, but a zealous bota¬ nist, who valued learning, and held a regular and extensive correspondence over Europe. Through this channel of communication, was Franklin early apprized of whatever chanced to engage attention in the scientific world; and his obser¬ vations were in their turn quickly transmitted across the Atlantic, and conveyed from England to France and Germany. Having carefully studied the important art of writing, he had at¬ tained a style remarkably simple and perspicu¬ ous, which gave the best effect to all his compo¬ sitions. His explication of the Leyden Jar, from the redundancy and defect of a single fluid, was favourably received both at home and abroad; though the hypothesis of a vitreous and a resin¬ ous fluid, proposed by Dufay, and generally pre¬ ferred on the Continent, appeared to explain the principal facts with equal readiness and facility","London, Franklin","FR,DE,GB,US",8,"France,Germany,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"

Enjoying some appointments at Paris, he for many years gave regular courses of Natural Philosophy, and by his popular and eloquent lectures, and his skill in preparing and exhibiting the illustrative experiments, he spread a general taste for science.

"735 glomeration of thunder-clouds to the prime con¬ ductor of an electrical machine. Winkler next, and with more decided arguments, contended for the identity of those powers. Franklin, following the same train of speculation, enumerated in a clear and methodical order the different circum¬ stances of resemblance. But it was necessary to pass the circle of mere probabilities, and he pro¬ posed as the final proof to have recourse to direct observation. His suggestion wTas, to erect on the top of some eminence a tapering iron rod 40 feet high, which he conceived would attract electricity from the charged thunder-clouds. Preparations were accordingly made in France for trying that bold experiment. In the spring of 1752, Dali- bard, a distinguished botanist, had an iron rod 40 feet in height tied with silk cords to a post in the neighbourhood of Paris, the lower end being pro¬ tected from rain by a sort of sentry-box. The ap¬ paratus was, during his absence, intrusted to the charge of a resolute carpenter, who watching the first appearance of a thunder-storm on the 10th of May, ran to the spot, drew sparks from the rod, and, assisted by the curate of the vil¬ lage, actually charged an electric jar. The demonstration of the nature of Lightning was thus rendered complete; but an experiment so wonderful deserved repetition. It was eagerly performed, under the direction of Buffon, in the Royal Garden at Paris ; and, during the months of July and August, it was tried with the same results near London, where Canton succeeded in detecting atmospheric electricity by means of a common fishing-rod","Franklin, Paris, Paris, London, Canton","US,FR,GB",8,"United States,France,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Intelligence now came from America, that Franklin had performed his experiment in a finer style. Not having the opportunity of an eminence in the flat country around Phila¬ delphia, he imagined the expedient of employ¬ ing a boy’s kite, to gain a great elevation in the air. To the end of the hempen string, from which hung a small key, he fastened a piece of silk cord, for holding in his hand. On the 15th of June in the afternoon, while a storm was ga¬ thering, he walked into the fields, and, assisted by his son, he launched the kite, when, to his inexpressible delight, he saw the loose fibres stretch out from the string, heard a snapping noise, and observed the pendant key not only to attract light substances, but to give sparks on approaching his knuckle. These were all deci¬ sive marks of electrical action, and answered his most sanguine expectations. The success of this trial encouraged him to entertain the daring project of turning aside the stroke of heaven, and of guarding our edifices from the ravages of thunder, by the erection of lofty conductors",Franklin,US,8,United States,North America

"The cultivators of the mountain districts on the confines of France, Switzerland, Italy, and Ger¬ many, seemed enchanted by the discovery, and whole fields were planted with those Paragreles, which, like embattled spears, dared the front of heaven. The question relative to the utility of Hail-Protectors was now referred to the Institute of France; but that learned body, though it clung to the charm of the Thunder-Rod or Paratonnerre, rejected with scorn the pretensions of the Paragrile. But the faith of the believers was not so easily shaken, and a succession of angry and querulous pamphlets for a while kept up the dispute. Yet we may infer that the con¬ fidence in the efficacy of such notable protectors is fast declining, since an old auxiliary—the agi¬ tation of the air by the firing of mortars—has been recalled to their aid.1 In the latter part of the eighteenth century, Electricity was enriched by a continual acces¬ sion of curious facts and experiments. New instruments were devised, of nicer construc¬ tion, to measure the intensity of electrical at¬ tractions and repulsions. The catalogue of electrics themselves was not only extended, but rendered more definite, by distinguish- ingThe opposite qualities of the substances rub¬ bed. Some steps have likewise been made towards a more precise theory. If a ball elec¬ trified vitreously be approached to an insulated cylinder, the nearer end will assume the resin¬ ous electricity, while the remoter extremity will indicate the vitreous; the limit of neutrality al¬ ways advancing to the approximating ball. This capital experiment appears to furnish the true explication of the Leyden Jar. But it involves a more extensive principle: Pressure may be con¬ sidered as only close apposition, and friction is evidently a case of repeated pressure. Hence the action of the Electrical Machine itself, and hence likewise the theory of that beautiful contrivance, the Electrophorus, first announced by Wilke of Stockholm in 1762, but named and fully de¬ scribed in 1776 by Volta2 of Como, to whom electrical science was afterwards so much in- 1 Orioli, professor of Natural Philosophy at Bologna, seems not disposed to acquiesce in the decision of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He appeals to the liberality and opulence of the French nation, and gravely recommends it to plant paragr&les, armed with metallic wires about 40 feet high, and not more than 500 feet apart, over its wide territory; and farther proposes that the experiment should be continued for ten years, under the inspection of some competent agricul¬ tural board.

"741 the native mineral fixed to a broad cork, and set to float in a dish of water. An artist of the opulent town of Amalphi, the great emporium of the East, and seated on the shore of Calabria, in the direct route of the Crusaders, improved the construction, and marked the north point by a Fleur-de-Lis, the armorial bearing of the king¬ dom of Naples. From its directive property, it was now called in English the Loadstone or Leading Stone. About a century afterwards, the method of communicating magnetism by the touch was probably discovered, the needle or small bar of steel so treated being then applied to a card suspended on a pivot. The Germans bisected successively the eight cardinal divisions^ which had satisfied the Romans and the Chi¬ nese, into sixteen and thirty-two points, to which they gave those compound names which are still retained. About this period, when ob¬ servations were not very precise, the needle was judged to turn nearly towards the north; but Columbus, in his first voyage of discovery, found it to decline from the meridian as he advanced on the Atlantic; and this apparent change of the laws of nature occurred under circumstances which would have appalled a less determined commander.

"Magnetism made little further progress, till Dr Gilbert, the founder of experimental science in England, explored the subject by a course of patient and skilful investigation. To this emi¬ nent philosopher we are indebted for the disco¬ very of the few connecting principles. Every magnet, whether natural or artificial, has its powers concentrated in two opposite points, termed the north and south poles; and the si¬ milar poles of separate magnets repel each other, while their dissimilar poles exert a mutual at¬ traction. When a piece of soft iron is approxi¬ mated to a magnet, it becomes itself a magnet, the nearest end assuming an opposite polarity, and therefore being constantly attracted. If a long iron bar be held in a position nearly verti¬ cal, its lower extremity is always found to ma¬ nifest the properties of a north pole ; and, from this induced power, Gilbert legitimately inferred the magnetism of our globe. He likewise imi¬ tated its structure, by fashioning a magnet into a small sphere or terrella, and hence illustrated the declination of the needle, as well as its dip, or the position which it takes when, after being poised freely on its centre of gravity, it receives the magnetic virtue,—a property which had been first noticed by his countryman Robert Norman in 1576. But something more was required to explain completely the directive property of the needle. If a magnetized sewing needle be set to swim on the surface of water or quicksilver, it will not advance towards the north, but readily traverse in that direction. In fact, while the one end is attracted, the other is equally repel¬ led, by the vast magnetic power of the earth con¬ centrated below the Arctic Region, but having really the same quality as what was first named the South Pole of the needle. Those antagonist forces will have no influence therefore to draw it forwards; but if it be turned aside, they will combine their oblique action to bring it back into its meridional position",Gilbert,US,8,United States,North America
"Gilbert’s original work Was republished at Ferrara in 1629, with a commentary by Cabseus, a Jesuit; and fourteen years afterwards another member of that learned fraternity, Kircher, a man of singular talent and immense erudition, produced at Cologne a full treatise on Magnet¬ ism, which contained little* however, of sound doctrine, but abundance of fanciful speculation","Gilbert, Ferrara","US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"Hooke remarked the debilitating effect of heat on the power of the magnet. Newton appears to have sometimes amused himself with mag- netical experiments, but did not bestow much thought on the subject: He was disposed to consider the force exerted as reciprocally pro¬ portional to the cube of the distance",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Between the years 1712 and 1725, numerous experiments were made by Hauksbee, Brook Taylor, and Musschenbroeck, to determine the relation of the intensity of magnetic force to the distance of its action; but though the power ap¬ peared to decrease most rapidly with its remote¬ ness, no satisfactory conclusion was obtained",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America
"The cause of this failure must he imputed to the intermixing, in the statement of the results, no fewer than four distinct forces, emanating from the several poles. Taylor, the most acute of those observers, reckoned the magnetic force, if exerted very near, to be inversely as the square, but when more remote, as the cube, of the distance",Taylor,US,8,United States,North America
"It was reserved for Coulomb,2 sixty years after¬ wards, to discover the true law of magnetic at¬ traction and repulsion, by means of his delicate Balance of Torsion, though the same deduction had been previously announced by the ingenious Lambert. The earlier experimenters had sought to ascertain those forces by the loads required to effect a separation, or to counterbalance their action. Graham proposed the more precise me¬ thod of computing the magnetic forces, from the number of vibrations performed in a given time by the needle; but his suggestion was overlooked, to be invented again, and generally adopted",Graham,US,8,United States,North America
"2 Charles Augustin Coulomb, a most accurate and ingenious experimenter, was born at Angouleme in 1736, and died at Paris on the 23d of August 1806. Receiving his education in that capital, he embraced the military profession, and was sent as engineer to the island of Martinique. He afterwards held various employments, and might have risen to the highest distinction, if he had been as compliant with the times as some others of his countrymen",Paris,"MQ,US",8,"Martinique,United States","North America,North America"

"The variation of the needle has been accurate¬ ly observed in Europe during nearly two centu¬ ries. It seems to be continually increasing, though in a most irregular manner. In the year 1657, it stood directly north at London; and it held the same meridional position in 1660 at Paris. But during the remainder of the cen¬ tury it changed towards the west, at the rate of IT annually at London, but only 6' at Paris","London, Paris, London, Paris","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"rate of augmentation has been scarcely 2, and the change at Paris is still smaller. This rapid decline of the annual change appeared to intimate the needle’s approach to the limit of westerly digression, from which it would slowly return in the contrary direction. Such expecta¬ tion, however, is not yet realized. In 1817 the needle was observed at Paris to make indeed a slight retreat; hut, in the following year, it moved forward again, and continues to advance, though slowly, to the west. Its relaxation in London is less apparent.1 But the variation of the needle, besides its annual progress, is liable to other alternating changes, amounting sometimes to a considerable quantity. Its diurnal deviation was first re¬ marked by Graham in 1722, and ascertained with more precision in 1750 by Wargentin of Stockholm. But Canton investigated the sub¬ ject with great ability and perseverance, in a very extended series of observations begun in 1756. He found the needle to travel westwards from about nine o’clock in the morning till two in the afternoon, when it remained for a while stationary, and again slowly returned, regaining its station during the night, or before the early dawn. In the morning, its movements were less regular. The extent of those digressions was found to depend on the season of the year: near the end of December, the diurnal aberra¬ tion was only 7', but it mounted to 13^' about the middle of June","Paris, Paris, London, Graham, Stockholm","US,GB,SE",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Sweden","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Canton, with great probability, referred these curious facts to the influence of heat on the magnetic forces. Though the direction of the needle is mainly determined by the internal magnetism of the globe, it must also be affected in some degree by the local attraction of the fer¬ ruginous particles united to mineral substances, and profusely scattered on the surface. If we suppose their joint power inclines to the east of the magnetic meridian, it will evidently act more feebly in drawing the needle aside during the warm portion of the day, and in the height of summer. This ingenious explication seems to be corroborated by the observations made in 1794, on the island of Sumatra, by Macdonald, who found the diurnal aberration there not to exceed 3'. But the alternation of heat and cold in that equatorial climate is likewise more li¬ mited",Canton,US,8,United States,North America
"But deductions of this kind are liable to a source of inaccuracy which had long escaped observation. The bolts and other pieces of iron in the frame of a ship, ranging mostly before the binacle, very sensibly derange the bearings of the compass by their local attraction. This deviation seems to have been first remarked by 1 The celebrated astronomer Burckhardt, by combining together a number of observations, has deduced a formula for the variation of the needle at Paris. Admitting its accuracy, the maximum will be attained in 1837, and reach to 24° 26', the period of magnetical revolution being completed in the space of 860 years",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"Hansteen infers, from experiments he made be¬ tween the years 1819 and 1826 on the oscilla¬ tion of the needle, that the magnetic intensity has been decreasing annually at Christiania, London, and Paris, by the 235th, the 725th, and the 1020th parts respectively.

"The chief properties of the rays of Light con¬ sist in Reflexion and Refraction. With the for¬ mer the ancients were sufficiently acquainted, but they had only a vague notion of the con¬ nexion between the angles of Incidence and Re¬ fraction. It is somewhat singular that both the Telescope and the Microscope should have been several years invented before the law on which their construction depends, or the constant re¬ lation between the sines of those angles, was de¬ tected. This important discovery was made by Snellius, but simplified and first published in 1637 by Descartes, who greatly reformed opti¬ cal science. The progressive motion of Light was next beautifully deduced from the annual anticipation and retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, by the ingenuity of Roemer, a young Danish astronomer, who had been in¬ vited to France in 1672, and there liberally en¬ tertained for nine years, till he was recalled to his native country and loaded with lucrative and honourable appointments. One might suppose that the aberration of the fixed stars, or their apparent circular shifting in the heavens, would have been hence anticipated, as a simple in¬ ference from the motion of Light combined with the revolution of the Earth in its orbit. Such a consequence had been foreseen by the acute mind of Descartes, who therefore adopted the instantaneous propulsion of light as a funda¬ mental principle in his Dioptrics. Were it otherwise, he maintained the stars would not appear in their true positions, and the sun would be seen eclipsed long after his conjunc¬ tion with the moon. These considerations, however, were quite overlooked, when Bradley in 1729 established his fine discovery within close limits, but on the very same grounds.1 Astronomers had been obliged to abandon their attempts to construct telescopes of much higher magnifying powers, and to contract the apertures, and consequently to reduce the mea¬ sure of illumination in order to procure distinct vision. Colour was still imagined to depend merely on the various mixture of light and shade. But Newton’s grand discovery of the decomposition of the Solar Beam, first communi¬ cated to the Royal Society in 1671, and further explained by his correspondence during the three following years, changed the whole aspect of the science. The ingenuity in devising the simple and beautiful experiments with combined prisms, is not more admirable, than the force and clear¬ ness of the reasoning which deduced from them such splendid conclusions. The mild spirit of the philosopher was wounded by the attacks of petulance and contradiction; and he quietly re¬ tained, in his closet, for the space of upwards of thirty years, the sequel of those invaluable experiments, and only consented to publish the Treatise of Optics after his reputation had final¬ ly triumphed over all opposition. This resolution is much to be regretted, as it not only post¬ poned the diffusion of genuine science, but gave occasion to the blending of some speculations which the discerning author would probably not have published in the high meridian of his in¬ tellect. Though the experimental procedure on which the work rests had been strictly induc¬ tive, yet was the composition cast in a synthetical form,—broken into a series of propositions, with their preliminary apparatus of Axioms and De¬ finitions ; which commonly involve assumptions, and so far from giving more precision to our reasonings, imperceptibly lead to the admis- 1 In a letter of Descartes, bearing the date of 1634, he notices an experiment proposed by a Dutch correspondent, to prove that Light takes a sensible time to arrive at the eye from a distance. This was to wave a tiaming torch at night, and observe its reflexion from a mirror removed only a quarter of a league. The French philosopher with his friends repeated the experiment several times, and could not discern the smallest interval between each bending of the flame and its reflexion","Jupiter, Bradley","US,FR,NL",8,"United States,France,Netherlands","North America,Europe,Europe"
"sion of errors. The very term Ref Tangibility, which Newton, under the guise of a definition, applied to the rays of light, became afterwards a source of misconception. It evidently con¬ verted the refraction of light into a general pro¬ perty belonging peculiarly to the rays them¬ selves, and therefore independent altogether of the quality or nature of the refracting medium",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Notwithstanding these few blemishes, arising merely from hasty generalization, the Newtonian Theory of Light and Colours is undoubtedly one of the noblest efforts of human invention. It quickly modified the projects of opticians. The imperfection of the Telescope was hence found to proceed only from undue mixture of colour in the image, occasioned by unequal refraction, which no change in the forms of the glasses could remedy. The Reflexion of Light alone offered any chance of improvement. Newton had constructed a small Catoptrical Instrument with his own hands; but for many years after¬ wards no artist appeared that possessed sufficient skill to imitate and improve it. The ingenious Mr Hadley in 1723 was the first who succeeded in getting a Reflecting Telescope made for his private use; and we may presume that the great inventor himself, before the close of life, enjoy¬ ed the satisfaction of seeing his early ideas rea¬ lized. Such was not the fortune of James Gre¬ gory, whose Reflector, more complex indeed, but likewise more commodious, had remained a mere speculation, till about this time it was manufac¬ tured and came to acquire high reputation. James Short particularly distinguished himself by the finished execution of those instruments, and for a long time he maintained the superiority of the English artists. Every improvement in the con¬ struction of the telescope contributed to the ac¬ curacy of astronomical observations",Newton,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"Hadley not only gave an impulse to practical astronomy, but soon enriched its stores by that invaluable instrument the Quadrant of Reflexion, which has ultimately produced a complete revo¬ lution in the art of observing. A similar instru¬ ment was proposed by Newton as far back as the year 1669, in consequence of an unsuccessful attempt of Hooke; but the description had been laid aside and neglected till 1731, when the an¬ nouncement of Hadley’s invention recalled it from oblivion. The mode of finding an altitude hitherto practised at sea was liable to much uncertainty, since it required to direct the eye first to the horizon and next to the disc of the sun, though the instrument might have its posi¬ tion altered during this interval by the motion of the ship. The difficulty was now obviated by employing a movable index, which brought the sun’s image to touch the boundary of the horizon",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"But, dissatisfied with this theory, Euler in 1747 endeavoured to prove the possibility of destroy¬ ing the coloured margin of a focal image, by imi¬ tating the structure of the eye, which he con¬ sidered as a perfect optical instrument. He pro¬ posed to construct a convex lens, by joining two meniscus glasses holding water in their cavity; and expected from such a combination not only to correct the spherical aberration, but to pre¬ vent the border of colour. All his attempts, however, to obtain distinct vision, were unsuc¬ cessful. Yet he still persisted in holding it to be a Law of Nature, that not the refractions of the extreme rays, but the indices of their powers, are constantly proportional; and from this ma¬ thematical or metaphysical assumption, he strict¬ ly deduced his calculations. These speculations of Euler made some noise in the scientific world, and shook the confidence abroad in the accuracy of Newton’s experimental conclusions. About this time John Holland,1 bred a silk-weaver, the trade of his father, a French Protestant refugee, being fond of mathematical studies, had chosen to embrace, in partnership with his son, the pro¬ fession of an Optician, as more congenial to his taste. Having already acquired reputation for ingenuity and skill, he communicated in 1752, > John Dolland, born in Spitalfields in June 1706. Left by the early death of his father in straitened circumstances, he was obliged to toil for the support of the family. But his thirst after useful knowledge led him to devote every spare moment to private study, and even to encroach on the hours of repose. By such severe application he made considerab e proficiency in geometry and algebra, in optics and astronomy, and added to these attainments a tolerable acquaintance wit i the ancient languages. He became anxious to follow a profession better fitted to his genius, and in 1752 hejoined his son Peter, who having quitted silk-weaving, had successfully commenced the business of optician. The discovery of achro¬ matic glasses in 1758 established his reputation, and afforded a prospect of the large fortune afterwards reaped by the indus¬ try and perseverance of his successor. But the elder Dolland had only begun to taste the sweets of prosperity: while en¬ gaged intensely in the perusal of a new memoir of Clairaut, he was, on the 30th November 1761, struck with a fit ot apo¬ plexy, which in the space of a few hours hurried him to the grave",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"This simple and well-devised experiment esta¬ blished therefore, in contradiction to Newton, the important principle, that the length of the spectrum, or the dispersion of the extreme rays, is not always proportional to the mean refraction, but depends on the constitution of the diaphanous medium. The result already indicated an im¬ proved construction of the telescope, by substi¬ tuting a compound object-glass, inclosing water, nearly in the manner attempted by Euler. But Dolland rejected this imperfect expedient, and sought to produce an unalterable combination with different kinds of glass: Having struck into the right path, he pushed forward to a great discovery. He tried to select among the dif¬ ferent kinds of glass such as might effect his purpose; and after a long and perplexing re¬ search, he finally preferred the combination of crown and flint glass; the refractive power of the former being to that of the latter as two to three, while their opposite dispersions are equal",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The same judicious philosopher, combining eminent practical skill with deep and accurate science, succeeded by unwearied application in achieving the grandest improvement effected in the construction of achromatic glasses since the time of Holland. Fraunhofer conducted per¬ sonally the whole train of a large establishment; he directed the preparation and fusion of the materials, selected the proper pieces for grind¬ ing, and prescribed the due forms. The glass produced under the patronage of the liberal Bavarian government greatly surpassed in qua¬ lity every other kind: It had a translucid pu¬ rity, and a uniform consistency. Fraunhofer constructed with it the most perfect object-lenses, of more than eight times any former dimension, and exceeding nine inches in diameter. He had proposed to attain an aperture of ten inches or even more, and would unquestionably have suc¬ ceeded, if death had not prematurely stopt his ardent career. The power and brilliancy of such magnificent telescopes transcended all concep¬ tion. 1 If the rays of the coloured spaces of the spec¬ trum be so widely diversified in their illuminat¬ ing energy, they differ no less in the property of exciting or communicating heat. Common language betrays in this respect their distinctive characters. Red and orange are termed warm colours, green temperate, and blue and violet are said to be cold. The first that endeavoured to measure the heating powers of the coloured rays of the spectrum was the Abbe Rochon, who in the summer of 1776 employed for that purpose an air thermometer and a prism of flint glass",Holland,US,8,United States,North America
"But though he used some precautions, and re¬ peated his experiments, the results were not very nice or consistent. Without venturing to compare the calorific intensities of the extreme rays, he yet reckoned those of a bright red as about eight times more powerful than such as gave the liveliest violet, and considered the bor¬ dering orange as the hottest spot in the spec¬ trum. But in this country the differential ther¬ mometer, modified as a photometer, being an instrument susceptible of incomparably more precision, was applied to the spectrum of flint glass in 1798. Dividing the whole extent into four equal spaces, the calorific energies of blue, green, yellow, and red might be represented with tolerable exactness by the series of square numbers 1, 4, 9, and 16. Two years after¬ wards the famous Dr Herschel tried to measure the impressions made by the coloured rays on the small bulb of a mercurial thermometer, and arrived at the paradoxical conclusion, that the hottest part lies even on the outside of the red, and at a little distance beyond the extr eme ter¬ mination of the spectrum. It was thence in¬ ferred that there are dark rays which give only heat and not illumination, and travel in com¬ pany with the solar beams, though less sub¬ ject to refraction. This bold hypothesis was for a time regarded with wonder and applause; but the delicate observations of Berard, by the help of an Heliostate to direct the incident rays and give them a steady effect, soon demolished the fabric. A large circular prism or the outer- ring of a huge burning glass has been since em¬ ployed to mark with nicety the limit of the 1 The Bavarian flint-glass appears free from those wavy lines or streaks which still impair the hest English specimens, and displays besides one-third more of dispersive power.

"The knowledge of such attempts was not wanted to direct the ingenuity of Fresnel1 into the right path. He calculated the curvature of the suc¬ cessive concentric segments which would pro¬ duce a correct focus, and advanced the construc¬ tion to a regular system, on which Soleil, an ex¬ pert optician at Paris, has founded a manufac¬ ture. This compound lens has displaced the re¬ flectors from the French light-houses, and must soon, from its very superior power of concentra¬ tion, become generally adopted",Paris,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Such may he regarded the fine detection of the polarized rays of light by Malus, a French officer of Engineers, and one of the most ardent dis¬ ciples of the Polytechnic School; which in so short a period drew together and put into rapid motion a far greater mass of mathematical and physical talent than any of the older seminaries in Europe. The double refracting property of Iceland Spar, or the crystallized carbonate of lime, noticed by Bartholinus and accurately in¬ vestigated by Huygens, had likewise engaged the penetration of Newton, who concluded that the ray which suffers the unusual or extraordinary refraction must have its opposite sides affected by some virtue like magnetism which gives them a tendency to polarity.2 * 4 This curious and acute remark appears to have lain neglected near a hundred years among the crowd of ingenious speculations started in the optical queries.

At magnopere dubitandum artem in hoc negotio naturam posse imitari. (Piiotometria, sive de Mensura et Gradibus Lutninis, Colorum, et Umbrae, p. 7-) 4 The whole passage deserves transcribing. “ The unusual refraction of island crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some kind of attractive virtue lodged in certain sides both of the rays and of the particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of disposition, or virtue, lodged in some sides of the particles of the crystal, and not in their other sides, and which inclines and bends the rays towards the coast of unusual refraction, the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystal would not be refracted towards that coast rather than towards any other coast, both at their incidence and at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly, by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction, at the second surface; the crystal acting upon the rays after they have passed through it and are emerging into the air, or, if you please, into a vacuum. And since the crystal by this disposition or virtue does not act upon the rays, unless when one of their sides of unusual refraction looks towards that coast, this argues a virtue or disposition in those sides of the rays, which answers to and sympathizes with that virtue or disposition of the crystal, as the poles of two magnets answer to one another. And as mag¬ netism may be intended or remitted, and is found only in the magnet and in iron ; so this virtue, of refracting the perpen¬ dicular rays, is greater in island crystal, less in crystal of the rock, and is not yet found in other bodies. I do not say that this virtue is magnetical; it seems to be of another kind: I only say, that whatever it be, it is difficult to conceive how the rays oflight, unless they be bodies, can have a permanent virtue in two of their sides, which is not in their other sides; and this without any regard to their position to the space, or the medium, through which they pass.” {Optics, book iii",Newton,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"755 lus had early turned his attention to the more difficult problems in optics, and after his return, with a shattered constitution from an absence of several years spent in foreign service, obtaining more congenial employment at home, he re¬ sumed with enthusiasm his favourite studies, and devoted to them every moment he could spare. While intensely occupied with the in¬ vestigation of the phsenomena of double refrac¬ tion, a fortunate accident occurred, which dis¬ closed to him a new and splendid field of con¬ templation. In one of his frequent visits to the Observatory, during his residence at Paris, he chanced in the summer of 1809 to be struck with the brilliant reflexion of the setting sun from one of the windows of the Luxembourg Palace, on looking at the appearance through a prism of rock crystal which he slowly turned round, and remarked with surprise that one of the images changed regularly to brightness from obscurity. Next morning he repeated this 6. DOCTRINE Heat is the great principle of all internal mo¬ tion. Its various changes and gradations deter¬ mine the growth of plants and the expansion of animated beings. The knowledge of the pro¬ duction of fire was the earliest of human disco¬ veries, and already distinguished our species in its lowest condition from the brute tenants of the forest. The application of that element has most essentially contributed to the advancement of the arts and the general progress of society",Paris,"LU,US",8,"Luxembourg,United States","Europe,North America"
"So long as such notions prevailed, it is evident that no real advances could be made in the knowledge of the properties of Heat. The first thing required was to find a method of ascer¬ taining its intensity ; and for this invention we are indebted to Sanctorio, Professor of Physic in the University of Padua, the celebrated dis¬ coverer of Insensible Perspiration, who, near the end of the sixteenth century, laboured with ardour and success in improving Medical Science by the application of Mechanics. Hero, of the Alexandrian School, had anciently described a curious machine, which, by the alternate ex¬ pansion and contraction of included air during day and night, produced certain reciprocating motions; the Paduan physician seized the prin¬ ciple, and constructed an instrument on a small scale, chiefly adapted to measure the tempera¬ ture of the human body during fevers. It con¬ sisted of a pretty large ball of glass, terminating in a long narrow stem, which was inverted and plunged perpendicularly in water or coloured liquid. For the sake of convenience, the ball was sometimes flattened on the one side, and the stem rendered more compact by serpentine involutions. With this instrument Sanctorio tried to measure the heat of the rays shot from the sun, and even that of the lunar beams, which were fancied then to have a gelid influence",University,US,8,United States,North America
"757 melt is always the same. Guericke was the first who started from the thawing point, in di¬ viding the scale of a large spirit of wine ther¬ mometer. To regulate the divisions, two different ways occurred; either to assume a higher point, or to distinguish into small portions the capa¬ city of the hall. The latter was the mode adopt¬ ed by Newton, who recreated his mind with chemical experiments. Employing linseed oil, which expands largely, and bears a great heat, he subdivided the capacity of the glass into 10,000 equal parts; and beginning from the point of thawing ice, he found the liquid to ex¬ pand 256 at the heat of the human body, 725 at boiling water, and 1516 at melting tin ; but preferring smaller numbers, he assumed 12 for blood heat, and reduced the other numbers in the same proportion to 34 and 71. This method was quite philosophical, but of very difficult execution. A correct and ingenious process for determining the scale of heat was proposed in 1694 by Renaldini, a learned Italian mathema¬ tician. Taking the freezing and boiling of water for the extremes, he found the interme¬ diate points from a mixture of ten parts, com¬ posed progressively of melting snow and water just ceased from ebullition, the ingredients being 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, &c. About twenty years afterwards, Brook Taylor and Hauksbee applied that ingenious mode to as¬ certain whether the expansions of certain fluids are exactly proportional to the corresponding accessions of heat",Newton,"US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"This ingenious man had been a merchant at Dantzic, and through misfortune failed in busi¬ ness ; but having a good taste for mechanics, he removed into Holland, and settled as a philoso¬ phical instrument maker at Amsterdam. He began with spirit of wine thermometers, which he formed much smaller and neater than had been attempted before. But he soon preferred quicksilver, and having found it to expand from freezing water to blood heat, about 60 parts in 10,000, he assumed the number 64, and ob¬ tained the degrees by repeated bisections. In this practice he was confirmed, on observing what he considered as extreme cold, to descend just through half that space, or 32 degrees. From a mixture of water, ice, and sal ammoniac, the scale commenced; 32 degrees were allotted for the interval to ice-water, and 64 more for the ascent to blood heat. But he afterwards enlarged the range, and assumed another point from the limit of boiling water, which he placed at the 212th degree in the mean state of the atmo¬ sphere, though liable to some variation from the change of barometric pressure. Such was now his confidence in the delicacy of the construction, that he proposed the thermometer as an instru¬ ment for ascertaining the heights of mountains from the depressed temperature of boiling water; a very simple method, which has been lately re¬ vived by the reverend Mr Wollaston","Holland, Amsterdam",US,8,United States,North America
"The thermometers manufactured by Fahren¬ heit being remarkably neat and convenient, were, notwithstanding their arbitrary subdivision, widely dispersed over Germany, and introduced into Britain by the practitioners in physic, who at that period usually resorted to Holland for medi¬ cal instruction. But most strangely in France a very unwieldy and inaccurate instrument maintained its ascendancy. The thermometer of Reaumur had a ball near four inches in dia¬ meter, which was filled with spirit of wine dilut¬ ed with water. The scale began at the term of congelation obtained by an artificial process, but 758 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Holland,"DE,FR,US",8,"Germany,France,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Provided with Fahrenheit’s thermometer, the philosophers of Holland and Germany made some progress in the science of heat, while France ap¬ peared to rest satisfied with mere speculation",Holland,"DE,FR,US",8,"Germany,France,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"759 About this time, the practice of making obser¬ vations with the thermometer had become pretty general in England, in consequence of the dif¬ fusion of the very neat and accurate instruments manufactured by Fahrenheit and Prins, at Am¬ sterdam, which were likewise imitated in London by Wilson, who afterwards established a flou¬ rishing type-foundry at Glasgow, and held the professorship of Practical Astronomy. These thermometers were filled with quicksilver, and only four or five inches long, the stem clasped by a folded paper scale, engraved with successively bisected divisions, and the whole inclosed in a thin glass case. But the most philosophical con¬ struction of the thermometer was now proposed by tbe learned Celsius, who filled the chair of Astronomy in the University of Upsal, and had borne an active share in the operation of deter¬ mining a degree of latitude on the verge of the Arctic Circle. He started from the point of congelation, and reckoned just a hundred di¬ visions upwards to that of ebullition. This simple scale, commonly used in Sweden and Denmark, is the same as that which was after¬ wards adopted by the French under the name of centigrade^ in their complete and elegant system of decimal weights and measures. It is singular that Deluc, in rectifying Reaumur’s thermometer, should have retained such an arti¬ ficial subdivision as that by fourscore. But this philosopher had the merit of ascertaining that mercury dilates almost uniformly with equal additions of heat, while the expansion of the spirit of wine is variable, and ascends with an accelerating progression. A thermometer form¬ ed of alcohol, whether diluted or not, is hence exceedingly inaccurate, unless it be regulated by the comparison with a mercurial one","London, Wilson, Glasgow, University","GB,US,SE,DK,FR",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Sweden,Denmark,France","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"The practice of using thermometers filled with quicksilver led to the curious discovery of the con¬ gelation of that dense liquid. Professor Gmelin, who had been sent with a party of naturalists to explore the remote regions of the Russian empire, observed in Siberia, on the 16th of January 1735, the mercury to sink in the ther¬ mometric tube to a point which corresponds to the 120th degree below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale, while it changed into a solid mass. But the artificial freezing of mercury was first per¬ formed by Braun, Professor of Philosophy at Petersburg, in the month of December 1759, when the natural cold seemed to be 34° under tbe beginning of the scale. Having plunged the bulb of a thermometer into a mixture of pounded ice and sal ammoniac, the quicksilver appeared to sink progresively to 350°, and then to consolidate",Petersburg,"US,RU",8,"United States,Russian Federation","North America,Europe"

"In 1780 Lavoisier, assisted by Laplace, and employing his Calorimeter, ascertained the heat evolved from different bodies during their va¬ rious changes, from the several quantities of ice which it melted. This seemed to be a very simple and correct mode of investigation; yet was it liable to considerable inaccuracy, from the large portion of water which still remained adhering to the mass of pounded ice. But the French chemists rather confused the subject, by mixing up incongruous principles. Embracing the the¬ ory of Capacity, they likewise tacitly adopted the hypothesis of sensible and latent heat, only changing these terms by a sort of appropriation into free and absolute, while the poverty of their language suggested for that fluid such an im¬ perfect etymon as Caloric",Laplace,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"This remarkable experiment was more particu¬ larly described in 1632 by Cavalleri in his tract on the Burning Speculum: it was repeated and varied in 1658 by the members of the Academy del Cimento, who received the impression on the bulb of an air thermometer. The concentration of cold in the focus of a metallic reflector was again tried, during the severe winter of 1740, by the academicians of Petersburg, though with rather doubtful results, owing to their ignorance of the true circumstances on which the success depends. But, after an apparent oblivion of near forty years, the experiment was revived with striking effect at Geneva, and continues to hold a conspicuous place in every course of physical lectures","Petersburg, Geneva",US,8,United States,North America
"Metallic thermometers have indeed been con¬ structed, which indicate with great delicacy the ordinary temperature, and all the sudden changes of heat.

"indolent acquiescence by the countrymen o Newton, was either opposed or viewed merely as an ingenious speculation by most of the philosophers on the Continent.1 But a contro¬ versy now arose, which brought the accuracy of these principles to the test of observation, and secured their final triumph. It is evident that the length of a degree of the meridian must be proportional to the distance of the centre of mu¬ tual concurrence of the plummets from its extre¬ mities, or to the radius of external curvature",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"In the case of an oblate spheroid, therefore, those degrees would regularly enlarge from the equator to the pole. But the Trigonometrical Mensuration of France, begun by Picard in 1675, and completed in 1716 by Cassini, form¬ ing the most extensive survey yet attempted, was found leading to an opposite conclusion in the meridional arc, the degrees on the north of Paris, instead of lengthening, appearing to con¬ tract about a 430th partbelow those on the south, which would indicate an oblong figure, having its perpendicular diameters as 96 to 95. This perplexing result served to keep alive for some time longer the controversy on the Continent between the followers of Descartes and the grow¬ ing partisans of the Newtonian Philosophy. In the meanwhile, a clock made by the famous Graham, and carried out to Jamaica in 1732 by Colin Campbell, was ascertained by astronomical observations at Black-river, in the latitude of 18°, allowing for the influence of heat on the pendu¬ lum, to go 1' 58"" slower every day than in Lon¬ don. This quantity of variation Bradley found to exceed what would suit the figure calculat¬ ed by Newton, and he was therefore disposed to attribute the effects to some diminution of density in the equatorial regions.

About the same time Bouguer noticed some restrictions essential to the rigorous solution of the problem; but now Maclaurin took a most commanding view of the subject, and produced, first in his famous Dissertation on the Tides, and again more fully in his Treatise of Fluxions, printed in 1742, a geo¬ metrical investigation, distinguished by its ori¬ ginality, clearness, and superior elegance. This illustrious mathematician established, from the law of gravitation, the stability of a fluid sphe¬ roid revolving about its axis in a certain time, proved that every point within the mass would be pressed equally on all sides, and showed that even the superadded attractions of the sun and moon could not disturb the internal equilibrium of our Earth.

"After a pause of near forty years, the mensu¬ ration of the Earth was revived with increasing ardour and on a grander scale. The object first contemplated was merely to settle the difference of longitude between the observatories of Green¬ wich and Paris, by connecting them with a se¬ ries of triangles. General Roy directed the English survey in 1784, while similar operations were conducted by Cassini in France. The Re¬ volution soon followed, and prepared the public mind for the reception of every bold project. It was now proposed to adopt a universal and permanent system of weights and measures drawn from nature, the unit of lineal' extent being the thousandth part of a centesimal minute, or the ten millionth part of the quadrantal arc from the Pole to the Equator. To obtain this standard, it had been resolved to carry a chain of triangles over the whole extent, from Dunkirk to Barcelona; which was performed during the most eventful period of general excitement and commotion, by the profound sagacity, persever¬ ance, and undaunted zeal of Delambre,1 joined to 1 Born at Amiens on the 19th September 1749. Being designed for the church, he studied the ancient languages in the Gymnasium of his native city, first under the Jesuits, and afterwards under the tuition of the poet Delille, to whom he became warmly attached. At a ripe age, he was invited to the study of astronomy by Lalande, and soon adopted as his favourite pupil. In 1785 he began the vast series of his scientific labours, which occupied the rest of a long life. Without aiming at originality, Delambre produced very complete and valuable works, pursued his immense calculations with scrupulous nicety and incessant application, and distinguished himself as a most accurate, skilful, and indefatigable observer. He sought precision merely, and was rather indifferent about the elegance of his formulas or composition. Yet he was an ex¬ cellent Greek scholar, well acquainted with the principal modern languages, and indeed a man of general erudition.

"Those operations have no doubt proceeded very slowly, and yet the results of the first series were perplexing, the three degrees measured from Bunnose to Clifton successively contract¬ ing instead of lengthening, and therefore indicat¬ ing, like the earlier observations of Cassini, an oblong figure of the Earth. The whole arc agrees exactly with the last triangulation of France, in giving an oblateness of only the 334th part; but whether the intermediate discrepancies should be imputed to an error of azimuth, or to the pro¬ bable derangement from local attraction, still remains undecided",Clifton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Cassini and Maraldi seem to have been the first to solve this interesting question.

He was, besides, a very nice and accurate observer, and applied himself particularly to the search of comets, and the computation of their orbits. In 1784 he was joined to the commission for adjusting the difference of longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich; and when the Constituent Assembly had resolved to adopt a grand metrical system founded on the length of the meridional arc, he was appointed to measure the southern portion of it from Barcelona to Kodez","Paris, Born, Laon, Versailles, Paris, Barcelona","US,FR,NL,VE",8,"United States,France,Netherlands,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","North America,Europe,Europe,South America"

After a slow convalescence he resumed his labours; but every thing now combined to dishearten him,—the Avar with Spain, the ravages of the yellow fever, and the news of the reign of terror in France. After moderation had revived, Mechain with much reluctance was prevailed on to come to Paris ; but strongly pressed the expediency of extending the measurement two degrees farther into Spain, and insisted on carrying on that work himself. This pertinacity was not explained till after his death, when it appeared that he had concealed a discrepancy occurring in the rectification of his observations, which, without acknowledging the error, he no doubt hoped to remove by subsequent operations. After experiencing many difficulties, he vigorously renewed his labours in Valencia ; but his mind was depressed by anxiety for his reputation, and alarms at the spread of contagious disease.

"and therefore considerably less than what belongs to a perfect sphere. But the most accurate ob¬ servation of this kind was made by La Caille in 1740, from the top of a hill near Aix, to a signal on a high tower above the Rhone, about 96 miles remote, where he caused ten pounds of gunpowder to he fired, and found by the instantaneous blaze the difference of time between the two meridians, and then measured trigonometrically along the plain of Arles the intermediate distance, which gave 41,858 toises for a degree of longitude, or 260 toises less than a globular form would re¬ quire. Lambton estimated the degree of longi¬ tude on the parallel of 12° 82' to be 61,061 fathoms, or 57,294 toises; but his observations, and calculations seem not entitled to much con¬ fidence. The latest and most accurate measure¬ ment of a perpendicular to the meridian was performed in 1823, near Geneva, by Colonel Brousseaud, of theFrench engineers, in connexion with the late ingenious Professor Pictet, while the skilful astronomers Plana and Carlini com¬ pleted a similar operation on the plains of Italy as far as Padua. The first, being compared with the arc from Greenwich to Formentera, gave a 271st part for the oblateness of the Earth; but, when conjoined with the Italian prolongation, it redu¬ ced the quantity of depression to a 292d part of the equatorial diameter.

"Local attraction may deflect the plummet from its vertical position, but it can have little effect on its general gravitation. TLhe vibration of a pendulum, therefore, promises a readier and surer method of discovering the figure of the Earth. The difficulty is to ascertain the length with extreme precision, or the distance between the point of suspension and the centre of oscilla¬ tion. The pendulum constructed by Borda seemed to require little correction. It consisted of a slender iron wire about 13 feet long, termi¬ nated by a small cap of copper, to which was nicely fitted a ball of platinum about an inch and half in diameter. The vibrations were per¬ formed in two seconds and continued for twelve hours, the number being reckoned from the dis¬ tant coincidences with the pendulum of an astro¬ nomical clock.

"Clairaut showed that the particles of the same density must always range in distinct strata, to which the resulting force that urges them is perpendicular; and found the general equations, simplified afterwards by Euler, for assigning the stability of the fluid mass. But it was not until 1784 that Legendre gave a direct analytical so¬ lution of the problem, in the case of a homogene¬ ous spheroid approaching nearly to a sphere, which required the single condition that gravity should act perpendicularly at the surface. Laplace afterwards simplified and completed this investi¬ gation, by extending it to elliptical strata of dif¬ ferent densities. The solution, however, was not rigorous, and merely exhibited an approximation, by leaving out the cubes and higher powers of the series. The numerical results yet vacillate between the proportions announced by Huygens and Newton. It is indeed remarkable, that a sub¬ ject which has exercised the efforts of sublime genius, should have yet derived so little real elucidation from the stores of the higher calcu¬ lus. The theorems of Maclaurin still far trans¬ cend the most elaborate displays of analytical research. But his illustrious countryman Ivory, undismayed by such formidable difficulties, has lately revived the discussion, and, examining more narrowly the physical conditions of the problem, and thus restricting the differential equations, he has with felicitous address suc¬ ceeded in conducting his analytical procedure to a definite result.

The motions of the lunar y 304-6 305 nodes and perigee have been shown by the same profound philosopher to indicate a similar con¬ clusion. The form of the Earth is hence flatter than that of a homogeneous spheroid; and this difference appears to arise from the increasing density of the internal mass caused by superin¬ cumbent pressure. A like character belongs to Jupiter, the largest planet in our system; for his axes, which, from the combined action of gravity and centrifugal force, should have the ratio of 41 to 36, are observed to be only as 14 to 13, or 41 to 38, thus evincing the great compression of the internal mass","Laplace, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"The discussions relating to the figure of the Earth led to an examination of the Theory of the Tides, the great outlines of which had been likewise traced by Newton from the Law of Gravitation. The Academy of Sciences at Paris selected the complete investigation of this difficult subject for the prize offered in 1740; and never did three more illustrious competitors contend for the honour of an award, which was shared among Maclaurin, Euler, and Daniel Bernoulli","Newton, Paris",US,8,United States,North America
"Supposing the Earth were at rest and covered with a shell of water, any remote body, attracting the anterior surface with greater force than the lateral mass, and this again with greater force than the posterior surface, would evidently cause the fluid to rise on the opposite sides and form a prolate spheroid, having its longer axis directed to the disturbing agent. But this influence was proved by Newton to be inversely as the cube of the distance. Though the sun has above twenty million times more matter than the moon, yet being four hundred times more remote, he there¬ fore exerts three times less influence in raising the tides. While the ocean swells out both under and opposite to the sun, it turns another trebly more protuberant spheroid towards the moon. These elevations, differently combined, produce the variable heaving of the waters which constitutes the general tide. The conditions of equilibrium are easily determined; but it is a most arduous research to distinguish the several effects of the rotation of the earth and the re¬ volution of the moon, in retarding and modify¬ ing the oscillations of the irregular aqueous ex¬ panse. Such was the problem which so long exercised the genius and penetration of Laplace","Newton, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"The second sort of oscillations is occasioned by the diurnal change of the elevation and depres¬ sion of the sun; so that in midsummer, when the declination is greater, the stream tide at Brest rises seven inches higher in the morning than the following tide towards evening. This divaricating tide has no visible influence however on our shores; and to explain the equal swell of the waters during the day and the night, Laplace refers it to the retardation from a current of a certain uniform depth, which he estimated at DISSERTATION FIFTH","Brest, Laplace","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Hipparchus and Ptolemy discovered what are called The Equation of the Centre and the Erec¬ tion; and after an interval of fourteen centuries, Tycho and Kepler added the Variation and An¬ nual Equation.

He revised the investigation of the motion of the apsides, hut was mortified to find his calcula¬ tions gave only half the quantity derived from observation. The honour of confii ming the Newtonian Theory of the Moon was reserved, however, for our own countrymen. Dr Stewart, the successor of Maclaurin in the University of Edinburgh, discovered the true motion of the line of apsides by a simple and beautiful geometrical procedure, in which Ids inventive penetration happily supplied the flexibility of the modern calculus. About the same time Walmesley,1 an English Benedictine Monk, who afterwards attained the rank of Catholic Bishop and Apostolic Vicar, but had been com¬ pelled by religious and political bigotry to reap the advantages of a foreign education, produced in 1749, at the early age of 27, a correct analy¬ tical investigation of the motion of the Lunar Apogee, which he extended and completed in 1758","Newton, University, Edinburgh","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"But, after a prodigious exertion of ingenuity and perseverance, it was mortifying to find his solution assign for the variation of the Lunar Apogee only half the measure established by observation. Eider and D’Alembert, nearly about the same time, arrived at a similar con¬ clusion. The followers of Newton were sur¬ prised and mortified at the result, while the ad¬ herents of the Cartesian system already began to exult in the prospect of the immediate fall of such a towering rival. In this dilemma, Clairaut, to reconcile the result of analysis with the actual phenomena, proposed, without abandoning the great principle of attraction, to modify its recipro¬ cal gradation of intensity, by annexing to the square of the distance a small subsidiary term de¬ pending on its cube. This correction might be sufficient, from the proximity to the earth, for adjusting the Lunar motions, while it could have no sensible influence, he conceived, in affecting that duplicate ratio which directs the remote revolutions of the planets about the sun. But Buffbn, who began his career with the study of mathematics, showed, from the properties of the roots of equations, that such a modification of the law of gravity involved what appeared an ab¬ surd consequence, that a body would be attract¬ ed equally at different distances. Clairaut was not shaken by this argument, which he con¬ sidered as only metaphysical; yet so much discussion had been provoked, that, anxious to remove all doubts from the subject, he re¬ sumed his investigation, and pursued it with incredible labour and resolution. Carrying the approximation much farther, by computing the values of the higher terms of the series, and reiterating the process, he found the combined integrals to give exactly the double of the former result. This satisfactory conclusion, which con¬ firmed the simple law of gravity, and restored the harmony of the universal system, was an¬ nounced early in 1749. The bare mention of the fact was enough for the inventive powers of Euler, who, by quite a different procedure, soon obtained the true variation of the Lunar Apogee",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"781 mathematicians of the age extinguished for ever any lurking suspicion of the Law of Universal, Attraction. The great object of scientific re¬ search was henceforth to direct its application to the celestial motions and the improvement of practical astronomy. The rectification of the Lunar Tables, now become of such importance in the practice of navigation, was the fruit of those arduous calculations. Clairaut bestowed intense application, and digested his results into a clear form; he skilfully employed some data furnished to him by La Caille for adjusting the auxiliary equations, and thus produced Tables of the Moon’s motions distinguished by their very superior accuracy. D’Alembert proceeded more slowly and neglected such aids, so that his Lunar Tables never obtained estimation with astronomers. Euler excelled both his illustrious rivals in the wonderful command of the powers of calculation ; he worked with ease and rapidi¬ ty, and his fertile invention continually supplied new resources and suggested other paths of ad¬ vance. He suspended for a few months the further improvement of the Lunar Theory, and at the invitation of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, analyzed with all the fulness of research the influence of the mutual disturbance of the planets Jupiter and Saturn. But aiming at still higher perfection, after the interval of a few years he resumed this investigation, simplifying and greatly extending it. In the mean time he had computed a set of Lunar Tables, which he disposed in a clear method, having discovered the co-efficients of the several equations from theory alone","Paris, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"Euler in 1747 sent to the Academy of Sciences at Paris a most ingenious memoir on the de¬ rangement of Saturn’s motion, occasioned by the superior attraction of Jupiter.

He found that the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn are equally subject 782 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"But Euler was induced to push those researches still farther, and gained the prizes proposed by the Academy for the years 1754 and 1756, by his theory of the inequalities in the Earth s motion, caused by the planets. The three methods of investigation that he proposed were all of them quite different; and nothing seemed more asto¬ nishing than the facility with which his prolific invention struck out new paths. He discovered four small anomalies to result from their com¬ bined attractions, though it was scarcely pos¬ sible, for want of proper data, to assign the precise measures of those aberrations. He ven¬ tured, however, to estimate the mean progres¬ sion of the aphelia at 12 seconds annually, and the diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, which some astronomers still doubted, at 49 seconds in a century. He found that the eccen¬ tricities of the aphelia of Jupiter and Saturn are periodical, and complete their cycle in the space of 30,000 years. By an inverted application of the same principles, it was possible, by com¬ puting the co-efficients of the formulae from ac¬ tual observations, to determine the masses of those planets which are not accompanied by sa¬ tellites. Euler hence found that Mars contains rather less matter than the Earth, and Venus* only about the half, hut which by a subsequent calculation he nearly doubled. The process was too much involved to secure entire confidence in the results; and the rapidity and extent of his calculations had led to occasional mistakes",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"The powers of calculation were now turned to the erratic class of the celestial bodies, so long the objects of superstitious terror, but which Newton had likewise subjected to the great law of gravitation. While the planets revolve in ellipses approaching to circles, and lying nearly in the plane of the ecliptic, the comets describe elliptical orbits with very different inclinations, and so extremely elongated as to resemble pa¬ rabolas through a considerable part of their course. Being very small, they are seen for a short space only in the vicinity of the Sun, but become quite invisible during their distant excur¬ sive journey beyond perhaps the boundaries of our planetary system. The periodic time of a co¬ met, depending on the length of the transverse axis of its ellipse, can seldom be determined with any sort of accuracy. The few observations that can be made in the transient interval of its ap¬ parition are scarcely sufficient to assign its mean motion and the places of its nodes and perihe¬ lion. Newton, while he proposed the parabolic theory as sufficiently correct in the visible por¬ tion of the cometary track, gave two elegant constructions for discovering the elements of the curve from three proximate observations","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"783 performing its revolutions in about 751 years; he therefore ventured to predict its return about the end of 1758 or the beginning of 1759. In arriv¬ ing at this conclusion he was equally fortunate and circumspect; he found that the comet must suffer great derangements in its passage through our planetary system, from the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn, which he endeavoured to calculate, though with very doubtful success",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"The time of the expected return approaching, ex¬ cited intense curiosity in the philosophical world; and Clairaut was induced to apply his formulae in the investigation of the progress of the comet, which, after immense labour in calculation, as¬ sisted by several expert computers, he announced at a public meeting of the Academy of Sciences on the 14th of November 1758. He found that the last revolution would be retarded about 618 days longer than the former, not reaching the perihelion till the middle of April 1759. But on revising his computation, he reduced that term to the 4th of April, exceeding that of ob¬ servation by 12 days only, a discrepancy owing probably to the influence of the remote planet Uranus, which was not yet discovered. The comet was first seen by a peasant in Saxony on Christ- mas-day, but soon became the admiration of Paris, and procured for Clairaut the enthusiasm of popular applause. This remarkable erratic star, though visible only for a few months, had journeyed five years within the orbit of Saturn, though it never stretched its excursion to twice the distance of Uranus. It approached so near to the Earth as would have disturbed her mo¬ tions, if its mass had not been extremely small",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"The success and popularity of Clairaut drew some peevish reflections from D’Alembert, whose formulae, if he had taken the trouble to pursue their application, would have led to similar re¬ sults. Euler, whose researches on Comets were still more extensive and diversified, viewed this triumph of ardent exertion with the calmness and magnanimity of a sage. But Clairaut, eager to complete a work in which he had gathered so many laurels, next proceeded to calculate the dis¬ turbing influence of Jupiter and Saturn on the place of the nodes of the comet of 1682 and 1759, which has an inverted motion. Newton had shown that the perturbations in the planetary system always advance the perihelion and re¬ tract the nodes; but the case here was just re¬ versed, and the quantity of recession thence determined agreed most exactly with observa¬ tion","Jupiter, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"So gleamed the last efforts of a philosopher who happily united the highest vigour of intel¬ lect with suavity of manners and elegance of conversation, but whose days were shortened by excessive labour, and the seductions of re¬ fined society, which incessantly courted and ca¬ ressed his presence. Clairaut died on the 17th May 1765, at the age of 52, deeply regretted by a very numerous circle of friends, and leaving imperishable monuments of genius.1 A tribute of warm respect is paid to the memory of Clairaut by the celebrated but unfortunate Bailly, who thus elo- quently pleads the cause of abstract science:— “ Le portrait de M.

He employed calculation combined with a graphical process, and sought to abridge the labour, by help of a table of the descents of comets, or the motions which they would perform if their parabolic paths collapsed into straight lines. Thomas Simpson, the only person in our island who at this time appeared to emulate the Continental mathematicians, like- wise produced ingenious disquisitions on the Comets, and framed similar tables. Hennert, Tempelhoff, and Sejour, afterwards pursued the same subject, which has since been discussed with great ability by Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre. Other methods for discovering the orbits of comets have been more recently pro¬ posed by Delambre, Olbers, and Gauss; the last of which may be considered as the most elegant and complete. But all these analytical modes of solution are still very tedious and compli¬ cated; insomuch that the humbler procedure by the way of Trial and Error, or what is called False Position, is found in practice to be on the whole the shortest and most satisfactory.1 While the sublimer geometry thus gradually disclosed the various recondite anomalies which de M.

"The next effort of Lagrange obtained him the prize offered by the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1764, for his Discourse on the Libra- tion of the Moon, in which he most satisfac¬ torily explained, from the theory of Attraction, the cause of the Moon’s presenting always near¬ ly the same face towards the Earth. He arrived directly at the same general equations as D’Alem¬ bert, by a happy combination of the dynamical principle of that philosopher with the property of virtual velocities, which was the germ of his capital work on Analytical Mechanics. This subject he again resumed in 1780, and discussed it in the fullest and most accurate manner, having succeeded *in completing the integration of the chief equations",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"The theory of Jupiter’s Satellites is not only an object interesting in speculative science, but of great importance in the practice of astrono¬ mical observation for finding the longitude",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"But with regard to the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn, Lagrange and Euler came to oppo¬ site conclusions, the one exhibiting a continual acceleration, and the other a like retardation",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"Laplace, who has attained still higher cele¬ brity, now appeared on the scene. Displaying the same faculty of invention, he possessed nearly equal skill in the management of the Calculus, without reaching, however, the clear¬ ness, simplicity, and elegance of his illustrious rival. But he ranged over a wider field of dis¬ covery, and exerted greater and more persever¬ ing industry, and pressed forward with a loftier feeling of ambition",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"In 1773 Laplace, following the steps of La¬ grange, adopted a new mode of investigation, and pushed his calculations farther. Instructed by the successive advances of his predecessor, he 5 a 786 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"proved in 1775 that the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn have no secular equations, hut per¬ form all their changes within certain long periods, which hence reconciles the discordant conclu¬ sions of Euler and Lagrange. Having found that the variation of eccentricity of Jupiter’s orbit must cause a corresponding alteration in the mo¬ tion of the Satellites, Laplace transferred the same idea to the perturbations of our Moon, and thus discovered the true theory of her secular equation, or rather of that vast cycle in which the lunar revolutions are alternately accelerated and retarded. This very slow but gradual diminution of the moon’s periodic motion, which the intermediate observations of the Arabian Astronomers, between Hipparchus and Bradley, have incontestibly established, was at one time referred to the resistance from an ethereal fluid imagined to occupy the celestial spaces. La¬ place at first conceived that the retardation might be explained on the hypothesis of a progressive transmission of the power of Attraction, and com¬ puted that it would require 8000 times the cele¬ rity of Light, which travels 200,000 miles in a second, to produce this effect. But his sub¬ sequent inquiries having shown that Gravity must dart its influence more than 50 million times faster than Light, we may therefore safely consider it as quite instantaneous. This conclu¬ sion is highly important in a philosophical view, since it sets for ever at rest the various specula¬ tive attempts to explain the cause of Attraction by the agency of certain mechanical intermedia, and demonstrates it to he a primordial and ul¬ timate principle ordained by the Wisdom of the Supreme Architect.1 * * * * In the meanwhile Lagrange had in successive dissertations investigated the secular variations of the planets by a new and direct process, which he conducted with incomparable address and elegance. Nor did he confine his researches merely to theory, but applied the formulce to the motions of the five planets then known. In a subsequent investigation he most skilfully se¬ parated the terms of the equation which exhibit the secular deviations, from those which repre¬ sent the periodical changes","Jupiter, Jupiter, Laplace, Bradley",US,8,United States,North America
"The soaring rivals appear alternately to sur¬ pass each other. Laplace, continuing his re¬ searches, at last discovered, that the secular equation of the Moon affecting her mean motion and that of her perigee and of her nodes in the ratio of 4, 12, and 3, is produced by the slow variation of the solar attraction occasioned by the changing eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit resulting from the influence of the larger planets, though they cannot alter the great axis which determines the mean periodic revolution. La¬ grange then showed that the same results were deducible from his general formulce. In 1785 Laplace resumed his investigation of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn; and suspecting that Euler and Lagrange had not carried their approxima¬ tion sufficiently far, he pushed his calculations from the second to the fourth powers of the ec¬ centricities of their orbits, and proved that those planets can have no secular equations. But, having remarked that their mean periods are commensurable and very nearly as 2 to 5, he found their reciprocal acceleration and retarda¬ tion to follow the same ratio. The cycle began in 1560, and comprehends 929 years; so that at the epoch of 1750 Saturn had his period short¬ ened 48’ 44"", while that of Jupiter was lengthen¬ ed by 19' 28"". In 1788 he discovered two curi¬ ous laws that connect the periods of Jupiter’s Satellites, and gave a complete theory of their motions, which served as the basis of Delambre’s excellent Tables","Laplace, Laplace, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"After an interval ofseveral years, duringwhich Lagrange had totally suspended his mathemati¬ cal studies, he returned to his early pursuits with all the freshness of youthful invention, and all the vigour of matured and improved intellect. In 1808 he gave a most general solution of the pro¬ blem of Disturbing Forces, and by a wonderful effort of sagacity he reduced his equations into a form of the utmost simplicity and elegance.8 1 It is rather singular that Laplace should on several occasions betray a disposition towards materialism, while his inves¬ tigations point evidently to an opposite inference",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"The effect of cold was early remarked by the Dutch Arctic voyagers; but Bouguer first ac¬ curately observed the diminished agency of at¬ tenuated air during his sojourn on the summits of the Andes. Yet without demonstration Brad¬ ley gave a simple rule for computing the celes¬ tial refraction, and Mayer adopted another near¬ ly similar. Thomas Simpson, in a very ingeni¬ ous dissertation, derived a formula which is sub¬ stantially the same. The subject of refraction has likewise been discussed by Lambert, Kramp, Fontana, and more recently by Laplace, Gauss, Bessel, Young, and Ivory. The formula of La¬ place is complicated and inelegant, while Ivory’s method seems clear and simple","Brad, Fontana, Laplace, Young","US,RO,UY",8,"United States,Romania,Uruguay","North America,Europe,South America"
"The uncertainty regarding the sun’s real distance was finally removed by the skilful and numerous observations of the Transit of the 3d of June 1769. The several results differed scarcely the quarter of a second, and their con¬ currence fixed the parallax at 8‘6"". This like¬ wise agrees with the theoretical calculations of Laplace from the Lunar anomalies. But Bessel, having with immense labour combined and care¬ fully recomputed the original observations, has recently detected a small correction, which makes the parallax to he only 8*575"", and consequent¬ ly the mean distance of the sun 95,158,440 English miles",Laplace,"US,UK",8,"United States,N/A","North America,N/A"
"3. Discovery of New Planets and Satellites. It was an inveterate opinion, derived from the ancient Pythagoreans, that the number of the great celestial bodies must of necessity he six, the first perfect number, or one which contains all its subdivisions. When Galileo directed his tube to the heavens and detected some of the satellites of Jupiter, this notion retarded the assent of the learned to his discovery; hut after Saturn was found to he accompanied likewise by satellites, speculative philosophers sought to extend the catalogue of revolving stars to 28, the next perfect number. In this expectation, however, they were disappointed, and the Solar System received no further accession for the space of a century. The discovery of a New Planet was reserved for our own times",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"Herschel, a musician residing at Bath, though a native of Hanover, which he had left in early youth, devoted his leisure to the construction and improvement of reflecting telescopes, Avith which he continued ardently to smwey the heaArens. His zeal and assiduity had already drawn the notice of astronomers, when he an¬ nounced to Dr Maskelyne, that, on the night of the 13th of March 1781, he observed a shifting star, which from its smallness he judged to he a Comet, though it was distinguished neither by a nebulosity nor a tail. The motion of the star, howeA^er, Avas so slow as to require distant ob¬ servations to ascertain its path. It was for several months presumed to he a Comet; hut the hypothesis of a parabolic orbit led to Arery dis¬ cordant results. The president Saron, an expert and obliging calculator, was the first who con¬ ceived it to he a Planet, having inferred from the Few observations communicated to him, that it described a circle with a radius of about twelve times the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lexell removed all doubt, and before the close of the year he computed the elements of the New Planet with considerable accuracy, making the great axis of its orbit 19 times greater than that of the earth, and the period of its re¬ volution 84 years. Bradley, mistaking it for a fixed star, had observed it on the 3d December DISSERTATION FIFTH","Bath, Hanover, March, Bradley","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Some German philosophers, indulging their curious fancy, have traced among the distances of the planets an analogy, which, though not strictly accurate, yet approximates so near the truth, that if not really founded in nature, it may at least assist the memory. Kepler, whose ardent imagination inflamed all his speculations, believed that the harmony of our system wanted a planet between Mars and Jupiter. A similar notion was entertained by the ingenious Lam¬ bert, who further supposed it might be dark and invisible. Reckoning from Mercury, the first of planets, and assuming as the unit of measures its interval from the sun, the intervals of the rest will be expressed by the binary progres¬ sion 2, 4, 8, 16, &c.; and consequently the distances of the series of planets from the sun may be represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65, &c. While 3 denotes the distance of the Earth, and 17 and 33 indicate the distances of Jupiter and Saturn, the remote Uranus has come to occupy the place marked by 65. But a planet at the distance 9, between 5 and 17, the distances of Mars and Jupiter, was still wanting to complete the regular sequence","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"Herschel seized this ingenious idea, and com¬ bining his own observations, he concluded that the translation of the planetary system is di¬ rected to the constellation of Hercules. But the critical examination of Bessel has proved that no such regular transfer would reconcile the various discrepancies of the shifting stars",Hercules,US,8,United States,North America
"The Double and Multiple Stars have lately engaged the attention of observers. Their ca¬ talogue has been prodigiously augmented by the ardour of South and the younger Herschel, and by the unwearied assiduity of Struve at Dorpat, and of Inghirami at Florence. The Double Stars assume every hue, but generally the con- trasted or complementary colours; a circum¬ stance which seems to betray the influence of ocular deception. Their proper motions result probably from a circulation around their com¬ mon centre of gravity. The Multiple Stars may possibly derive their peculiar aberrations in certain cases from the revolution about huge invisible Suns. All these mutable Stars are extremely remote, descending so low as the twentieth degree of magnitude, and can there¬ fore be distinguished only by the penetration of the most powerful telescopes. Imagination is utterly bewildered by the shadowy visions which flicker along the horizon of Illimitable Space",Florence,US,8,United States,North America

"Galileo was beyond all comparison the glory of his age. His sagacity, his knowledge, his versatility of talent, his ingenuity as an inventor, his success in prosecuting his discoveries, and his zeal and elo¬ quence in making known their importance, gave him an enviable pre-eminence even amidst a mighty gene¬ ration.

"The hundred years which next succeeded (1650- G ) 1750) saw the triumphant application of mathema-^g^od17r() tics to Mechanics and Physics, and the establishment of the greatest mechanical theory of any age, that of Gravitation. The preparatory labours of a hundred and fifty years were brought, chiefly by the unparal¬ leled sagacity and genius of Newton, to a speedy and dazzling climax. His success brought numerous and worthy labourers into the field, but they found enough to do in gathering in the harvest which he had pre¬ pared for them",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"(7.) From 1775 to 1800 many branches of science still Character continued in the comparatively inert state which cha- oftheeC180thracterized a £reat Par^ °f the eighteenth century, century. There were, however, two or three notable excep¬ tions. One was the continued successful solution of the outstanding difficulties of the Theory of Gravity applied to the moon and planets, a task in which the continental mathematicians, and of these, in chief, Lagrange and Laplace, had no rivals, or even coad¬ jutors, on this side of the channel: Another was the foundation of Sidereal Astronomy by Sir William Herschel; and the last was the commencement of a system of Chemical Philosophy based on new and im¬ portant experiments, and including the laws of heat in combination with matter, which at that period very naturally ranged themselves within the province of the chemist. In this department two British and one foreign name stand conspicuous, Black, Caven¬ dish, and Lavoisier. I do not of course mean to affirm that other branches of science were not cultivated with success within the exact period of which we speak. Electricity, for instance, first statical, after¬ wards that of the pile, had a share in the discoveries and speculations of the time. But these were rather the mere extension of what had previously been thought of; or the first dawn of future important results, whose development fills a large space in the succeeding story",Laplace,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"(8.) The first quarter of the present century attained Character a higher and more universal celebrity. Scarcely a oft.he, branch of physical science but received important 1800-1825. and even capital additions. Physical Astronomy in¬ deed, no longer filled so large a space in the page of discovery, simply because the exhaustive labours of the geometers of the former period had brought it to a stage of perfection nearly co-ordinate with the means of observation, and because, by the publication of the Mecanique Celeste, Laplace had rendered available Mecanique and precise the masses of scattered research accu- e ep mulated by the labours of a century since the close of Newton’s career of discovery. It was in some sense a new book of “ Principia,”—not, indeed, the work of one, but of many; nor of a few years, but of two generations at least. Still there it was, a great monument of successful toil, which, like its prototype, was for many years to be studied, even by minds of the highest order, rather than to be enlarged","Laplace, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"The great number of scientific names of the first or¬ der of merit concerned in these numerous discoveries marks the extraordinary fertility of the period.

"801 tion of the latter ; and a few happily still remain to claim the respect and veneration of their disciples and successors. But the vast steps so recently made in Optics, in Electricity, in Magnetism, in Thermotics, and in Chemical principles, tended of necessity to call forth such an amount of laborious detail in the de¬ fining and connecting of facts and laws, and the de¬ ductions of the theories started to explain them, as seemed to render fresh and striking originality some¬ what hopeless, whilst they occasioned a vast amount of useful employment to minds of every order of ta- Optics. lent. The undulatory Theory of Light, nobly blocked out by the massive labours of Young and Fresnel, has afforded still unexhausted material to the ma¬ thematician on the one hand, and to the experimen¬ talist on the other; and ably have they fulfilled the double task, adding at the same time discoveries whose importance and difficulty would have made them still more prominent, had they not been the legitimate consequences of a still greater discovery already in our possession. Nearly the same might have been said for the sciences of Electricity, Electro¬ magnetism, and Electro-chemistry, had not the com- Electricity. parative newness of the whole doctrine of these sci¬ ences, and the suddenness of their first rise, and, per¬ haps still more, the appearance of a philosopher of the very highest merit, Mr Faraday, who fortunately at¬ tached himself to this special department, made the last thirty years an almost unbroken period of dis¬ covery. Radiant Heat, too, has been successfully advanced by labours comparable perhaps to those which marked its first rise as a science, and some other topics connected with heat have risen into great and practical consequence. Astronomy has been prosecuted with a systematic assiduity and suc¬ cess, especially at the British and Russian national observatories, which yields to that of no former pe¬ riod, whilst physical astronomy has been cultivated by methods of still improved analysis, and has achieved one triumph which France need not grudge to England, nor England to France,—so signal as to be placed by common consent in a position su¬ perior to any since the first publication of the theory of gravitation, more than a century and a half be¬ fore. This was the prediction of the position in space of a planet whose existence was unknown ex¬ cept by the disturbance which it produced in the Magnetism, movements of another. Terrestrial Magnetism has, for the first time, aspired to the rank of an exact science. In an illustrious philosopher of Germany, it has found its Kepler ; and the combination of na¬ tional efforts in collecting reliable data from the re¬ motest corners of the globe is characteristic of the Chemistry, practical energy of the age. Pure Chemistry has been cultivated with extraordinary assiduity; but though some general principles have emerged, none are comparable, from their importance, to the dis¬ covery of Dalton.

"It will be seen from the preceding paragraphs, that I have deviated in some respects from the withthatof scheme of my two distinguished predecessors in the the preced- composition of the Dissertations on Science, Professor Playfair and Sir John Leslie. The essay of the for¬ mer, which is the more finished and methodical, is admirably adapted to the period of the history of science of which he had principally to treat; the period, namely, of Galileo, Bacon, Newton, and Leibnitz. But the amount of material was smaller, and the principle of selection was also much simpler",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The positive science of that age might almost be re¬ duced to two heads, Astronomy, including its mecha¬ nical principles, and Optics. It was an age not more distinguished for the Truths it disclosed, than for the invention and right appreciation of the Methods of Discovery. Inductive Logic, and Mathematical Logic applied for the first time to dynamics, very justly claimed a place in a dissertation on the pro¬ gress of science, in a period when these preliminary doctrines and discoveries were the stepping stones by which even the basement story of the Temple of Nature could alone be reached. The Philosophy of Bacon and the discovery of Fluxions, occupied there¬ fore, with much reason, a large portion of Professor Playfair’s beautiful Dissertation ; and it is impossible to regret that an intellect so admirably qualified for tracing and displaying the intimate and historical connection of branches of knowledge so varied in their principles and character, should have been thus congenially employed, to the delight and edification of readers of every degree of acquirement from the highest to the humblest.1 1 In mentioning the name of my distinguished predecessor in the Chair of Natural Philosophy in the University of Min burgh, I willingly take the opportunity of noticing, in a few words, his peculiar merits, to which the Dissertation Chap.

"The mechanical and experimental sciences alone con¬ stitute a body of knowledge so large that it is arespon- sibility sufficient for one person to attempt to grasp them all, and to set forth in order the steps of pro¬ gress and improvement which have been so rapid, and even so startling. Since some of these have scarcely as yet been historically digested, and the broad features of contemporary discovery have not been gradually separated by the judgment of an impartial posterity from those slighter though praiseworthy details, which lapse of time and advance of know¬ ledge will throw into the shadows of distance,—this difficult and most laborious task falls principally upon the reviewer. The length and breadth of the subject of Natural Philosophy, and the cumbrous and scattered depositories of knowledge in which its records must be sought, combine to render not only the undertaking an arduous one, but the result of it a good deal more bulky than might be desired, or than was easily possible, in dealing with the glorious, but compact, history of Newton’s age",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"But as knowledge advances it extends in both directions towards speculation and towards practical applications, but most towards the applications. This Bacon well understood, and he has consistently main¬ tained, that knowledge, to be profitable to its cultiva¬ tors, must also be fruitful to mankind. And all the history of science since Bacon’s day has read this 1 I have borrowed but sparingly, in the following pages, from the existing compilations on the history of science. Indeed, a writer who intends to make a subject his own by a well-considered, fundamental plan of treating it, will use such works prin¬ cipally as a guide to his own further inquiries, and to assist him in selecting the topics worthy of fullest discussion. In this respect Dr Whewell’s excellent writings, already cited, have been of great use to me; and in the particular department of Astronomy, I have often referred to Mr Grant’s valuable History of that science, as well as to the writings of Delamhre, and the very elaborate Historical Essay by M. Gautier, on the problem of the Three Bodies, which is not, I think, noticed by Mr Grant, but which contains a most elaborate history of the researches of Lagrange and Laplace. In optics, I have consulted the systematic treatises of Dr Young, Sir D. Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Dr Lloyd, M. Moigno, and M. lladicke; and so of other subjects. Gehler’s Physikalisches Worterbuch, Fechner’s Repertorium, and that of Dove, afford a vast amount of historical infor¬ mation. The Transactions and Proceedings of the various societies, British and Foreign, have of course furnished a great part of my information.

"The era of Newton and Leibnitz was grandly distin¬ guished by the continually increasing applications of mathematics to physics, whereof Newton was the great teacher; the century 1750-1850, whilst profiting by the lessons of the past, has added almost a new one in the eminently practical character of its science, and in the no less scientific character of its practice","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America

Did mathematics riousto ever flourish more vigorously than under Newton 1 science* has pure physical science had greater triumphs than in the era of Volta, Watt, and Young X It was precisely because the new application of mathematics stimulated their growth, because abstract relations of quantity were vivified by concrete solutions of physical problems, that a new geometry arose","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"Dynamics could hardly be said to exist as a science without the invention of Fluxions as a language by which its conditions and results might be expressed; and from that time onwards, the necessities of the natural philosopher have been the prime sources of inspiration to the geometer, while the subjects have become so blended that a mere discoverer in mathe¬ matics has become a singularity. It would be hardly possible to point out any mathematician of the highest class since Newton, or but a few of the second class, who have not contributed almost as much to physical science as they have to analysis. Of purely mathematical discoveries, the great majority have been called forth by the immediate necessity arising from some problem requiring solution in astronomy, mechanics, optics, or heat. Lagrange’s method of Variations of arbitrary Constants in Integration, the artifices for the computation of attractions by Laplace’s coefficients ; the introduction of the method of fac¬ torials by Kramp in his solution of the problem of refraction, and numberless improvements in the Theory of Definite Integrals by Fourier and his suc¬ cessors, sufficiently warrant the statement, and show how richly the physical sciences have repaid to the purely mathematical ones the debt which they oi'igi- nally owed. One other conclusion may be drawn from these and parallel facts. It is that the com¬ binations arising out of external phenomena are more suggestive of the possible relations of number and quantity than is the most unlimited stretch of fancy and imagination; and I believe it will be conceded that, with few exceptions, theorems of the greatest value and beauty have been more frequently dis¬ covered during the attempt to solve some physical or at least geometrical problem, than in compre¬ hensive yet indefinite attempts to generalize the re¬ lations of abstract magnitude","Newton, Of, Laplace","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"The national pride of England in the triumphs of Newton impelled her ablest mathematicians to at¬ tempt to carry forward the synthetic methods which he had chiefly used, at least in his published works, to the more arduous and intricate questions of Me¬ chanics and Astronomy which presented themselves for solution in the course of the 18th century. Mac- laurin was almost the last Englishman of that period whose mathematical writings came into direct com¬ petition with the rising schools of Germany and France. The labours of Matthew Stewart, and Simpson were mostly geometrical; those of Landen and Waring, though profound, created little general impression; and, gradually, the extent and difficulty of the foreign mathematics, increased by the use of the Leibnitzian notation of differentials which was ab¬ solutely unfamiliar in England, deterred almost every one even from perusing the writings of Clairaut and D’Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace. Of the conti¬ nental mathematicians, Euler was probably the best known, owing to the lucidity of his writings and their eminently practical tendencies. Some idea may be formed of the negation of mathematical talent in Britain during the later portion of the last century, when we find D’Alembert declaring, in 1769, that if an Englishman is to be elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences, he will vote for Earl Stanhope as the best mathemati¬ cian there, as he believes, not having read any of his works !

But the notation of differentials, \AThich could alone break down the barrier between the British and foreign mathematicians, was first introduced at Cam¬ bridge by the efforts of Sir John Herschel and Dean Peacock about 1816, soon after which the transla¬ tion of Lacroix’s Differential Calculus, which they superintended, came into use as an university text¬ book. From this time the Avorks of foreign mathe¬ maticians began to be more generally read, particu¬ larly the Avritings of Laplace and Poisson; and Avithin ten or a dozen years subsequently, a few active and undaunted men, chiefly of the Cambridge school, such as Mr Airy and Sir John Lubbock, grappled with the outstanding difficulties of physical astronomy, whilst a larger number applied them¬ selves to the most difficult parts of pure analysis, and acquired great dexterity in its use in the solu¬ tion of geometrical and mechanical problems. Such, for example, were Mr Babbage, Mr De Morgan, Mr Murphy, and Mr Green ; and at Dublin Sir William R.

"coAreries of pure physics (such as Astronomy, Acous- (330 tics, Magnetism), are the results of either observation or experiment, and they consist in generalizations, by means of which a multitude of facts are reduced under one simple expression of a more general fact or principle. But instruments often very compli¬ cated are necessary for observation and for experi¬ ment ; as telescopes in astronomy, organs in acoustics, properly magnetized and suspended steel bars in magnetism. Art is required to construct these.

"mechanical skill, are both indispensable to make a telescope. A telescope then, though a mechanical invention, inasmuch as it is a deduction fiom phy¬ sical principles, not an addition to them, is j-et a deduction so ingenious—so far from obvious so im¬ possible to be conceived accidentally or by a loose thinker, and so easily made the instrument of innumer¬ able discoveries of the highest novelty and grandeur, that no historian of science ever thought of omitting the invention of the telescope, or of giving it an im¬ portance inferior to that of a discovery, containing as it did the germ of so many discoveries. In like manner a theory of optics might be written in which a tele¬ scope need never be mentioned; but would not the pedantry of such a work be obvious, or would any reasonable person wish to learn science after such a fashion ? The clear co-ordination of the parts of an invention towards the attainment of a given result, with a due regard to natural laws, and the properties of the sub¬ stances used, constitutes the merit of the invention; and this merit may be irrespective of the precise im¬ portance of the end of the invention, which may be intended to promote science, or commerce, or con¬ venience, or even to satisfy mere curiosity. A tele¬ scope would have been a telescope still, could we have imagined it invented with no other object than a deer¬ stalker’s sport; and so contrivances which in their ori¬ gin and application seem remote from scientific uses, constitute nevertheless real steps in the progress of knowledge. The steam-engine is one striking ex¬ ample. Originally devised with an exclusively com¬ mercial object—the extrication of the Cornish mines from subterranean water, it became in the hands of Watt, first an instrument for experiments on the re¬ lation of heat to matter; next, in its improved form, a beautiful exemplification of these laws, and an en¬ during monument of the sagacity and skill of its author, as well as the most important inorganic agent which exists in modifying the social condition of the entire globe. Finally, to illustrate the posi¬ tion from which we started, it becomes the instru¬ ment of fresh discoveries. This very engine has a theory to be worked out, probably unimagined even by its sagacious author—its operation as an agent for obtaining power from matter by the application of heat, is shown to be in all probability a single case of a more general law, including all kinds of machines and all sorts of matter; and this more general theory of heat as a motive power leads, once more, to new practical deductions, to the conditions under which such machines may be most usefully constructed and employed.1 Every instrument, every construction, which is founded on a theory, and in which a certain compli¬ cation of conditions is required to produce a certain result; a telescope, for example, or a steam-engine, or a bridge, is, in the first instance at least, an ex¬ periment. Few inventions are so simple and straight¬ forward in their plan, are so independent of the seem¬ ingly capricious behaviour of matter under untried circumstances, or depend so entirely on physical laws thoroughly understood, that the inventor can await, without the pang—at least of impatience—if not of anxiety, the moment of the realization, by actual trial, of his hopes and his calculations. We can all readily imagine the throb of anxiety with which Galileo pointed his glasses for the first time to the moon—with which Watt saw the cylinder of his As in model exhausted, and the piston descend under the ^ action of his separate condenser—and Stephenson, gine the stupendous iron tube at Conway resting for the first time straight as a ramrod on its two piers— these are moments of anxiety and of triumph, which place the inventor of a machine and the architect of a structure on a par with the discoverer of a planet, or with the author of a theory. “ Whenever an ori¬ ginal mind produces new combinations of thought and feeling,” says Sir James Mackintosh, with equal im¬ partiality and truth, “ whether its means be words or colours, or marble or sound, or command over the mighty agents of nature; whether the result be an epic poem, or a statue, or a steam-engine, we must equally reverence those transcendent faculties to which we give the name of genius.”2 It is almost needless to add the caution, that such praise is only applicable when the invention is such as to call forth the qua¬ lities which distinguish the Philosopher. It is not the mere command over the agents of nature which challenges our admiration, it is the foresight, the patience, the conceptive faculty, the clear-sighted and confident anticipations of what will be the re¬ sults of natural laws acting in given circumstances, these circumstances being in some essential particu¬ lars new. Merely to adopt known contrivances, where experience has already anticipated the result, may exercise judgment, but hardly genius; and to make contrivances in which the result depends rather upon laws of geometry than of physics, hardly come within the scope of these remarks",Conway,US,8,United States,North America

In fact, the former are to he regarded as the simpler investigations, whilst our terrestrial agents have their effects modified by the diversified states of aggregation and various mechanical properties of mat¬ ter, and by the numerous modifications of force arising from heat, electricity, or magnetism, to which it may be exposed. We have as yet made but an insignificant advance towards that completer system of Natural Philosophy of which Newton’s will form but one section, in which all the properties of matter and their consequences shall be as well understood as the particular property of gravity is at present. Many of these are to be learned by daily observation of the effects which occur in the ordinary progress of civi¬ lization amongst us. We are continually perform¬ ing experiments on a great scale and on purely com¬ mercial principles, which no individual philosopher or merely scientific society could have ventured to attempt. And in the midst of these appeals to experience, unexpected results are frequently occur¬ ring which send us back once more to the study of first principles, which, indeed, while they confound the empiric, do but establish the reputation of the philosophic engineer, who seldom fails to turn them to good account, both in his theory and practice",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

These varia¬ tions led to the discovery of the planet Neptune",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"The method of variations of the elements is evidently '' most applicable to the determination of Secular Per¬ turbations ; for to compute by means of it the ordi¬ nary inequalities involves an apparently unnecessary labour. The place of a planet is completely determined by three co-ordinates—its longitude, latitude, and radius vector; whilst the elements of the orbit are six in number, and when found, a further calculation must be made to find the co-ordinates of position. The more direct method of deducing the co-ordinates at once from the conditions of perturbation, was gene¬ rally followed until 1808, when Lagrange and Laplace almost simultaneously devised methods of using the variation of the elements with directness and despatch in the calculation of Planetary Pertur¬ bations. In the estimation of the second and higher orders of disturbance, it has even the advantage in these respects over the other method",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"(51.) The first person who perceived the probable sta- Laplace’s p^j^y of the major axes and mean motions was not S*covery!6 * * * * Lagrange hut Laplace, who, in a paper published in 1773, gave a demonstration, the sufficiency of which has not been doubted, that the major axes are in¬ variable, so far as the influence of the principal terms of the disturbances are concerned, that is as far as terms containing the cubes of the excentrici- ties inclusive, and the first powers of the perturbing masses. Nor does Laplace appear to have doubted that the mutual distinction of the terms, including secular changes, was not accidental, but would ex¬ tend also to the farther approximations. Lagrange, however, in a celebrated though short memoir of 1776, demonstrated the truth of the conclusion for the higher powers of quantities contained in the per¬ turbations of the first order, and that by methods peculiarly comprehensive and elegant, which he far¬ ther extended in 1781 to the other five orbital ele¬ ments, showing the periodicity within certain narrow limits of the excentricity and inclination, the only elements, except the major axis, whose variations menace the stability of the system. Yet it is quite impossible to separate completely the names of La¬ grange and Laplace in the effectual demonstration of this important truth, the former as frequently in¬ dicating the means of overcoming the more purely mathematical difficulties, as the latter was suggestive and far-sighted in anticipating their application to the peculiarities of our system","Laplace, Laplace, Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"Laplace discovered (1784) two remarkable theo- (52.) rems which limit the whole amount of the excentri- cities and inclinations of the orbits of the planetary t;es ancj in_ system, showing that if once small, they must ever clinations remain so; and, in particular, that the most massive ^ P1^-^ planets of the system (Jupiter and Saturn) must also taiy 01 lts' undergo the most trifling variation in these respects",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"In the case of the small planets between Mars and Jupiter, a wider range may occur (as indeed we prac¬ tically find to be the case), without endangering the permanency of the whole. It also followTs that these variations, though “ secular,” are practically 11 perio¬ dic ;” that is, that the excentricities and inclinations oscillate about certain mean values and within ex¬ tremely narrow limits, the periods of these oscillations being also of vast duration. Concerning such changes, theory is our only guide. The whole duration of astro¬ nomical records can barely reveal the existence of two or three of them, and tells us absolutely nothing of their remoter consequences. Lagrange calculated the superior limits of the excentricities of the larger planets, and M. Leverrier has recently, by more ac¬ curate methods, obtained results nearly coincident",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America

These also are subject to the same laws as found by Laplace and Lagrange for lower degrees of approximation ; and as MM. de Pontecoulant and Leverrier have confirmed the result (at least for all the larger planets of the system), we may conclude it to be a truth as firmly established as any negative fact can be, that our system is arranged for a duration apparently indefinite ; that if the planets cease to roll, and the sun and moon to do their office in enlightening the world, it must be in all (55.) Poisson’s addition to probability by an interposition of Almighty power, as direct and immediate as the creative energy by which they were launched into space, and (our earth at least) peopled with successive races of animated beings.1 We have, in the commencement of this section, disclaimed the intention of entering at large upon the Lagrange’s history of Lagrange’s discoveries. They fell more pro- oth.ef perly under the scope of the preceding Dissertation, b ' and an able summary and enumeration of his writings by no less competent a person than Dr Thomas Young will be found in the alphabetical part of this Encyclo¬ paedia. I will only add, that while scarcely a topic in physical astronomy, or in pure mathematics, failed to receive important additions from his pen, his memoirs on the Libration of the Moon, his solution of several problems of Sound and vibrating strings, and his methods of computing the perturbations of Comets, are amongst his contributions to science, most vividly remembered and most justly admired as models of analytical ability. He himself is stated to have preferred, amongst all his papers, one in the Turin Memoirs of 1784, on the Integral Calculus.2 With reference to the Lunar Libration, Lagrange (57.) confirmed the singular conclusion of Newton, that the Libration moon is a spheroid, having three unequal axes, the longest of which is always approximately directed to the earth, and the shortest is her axis of rotation","Laplace, Young, Newton","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"In consequence of this, the moon, of necessity, re¬ volves on her axis in the exact time that she circu¬ lates round the earth (supposing that at any time these periods were nearly, though not absolutely, coincident), and is subject (as Newton had divined) to a species of oscillation upon her axis, owing to the line of the earth’s attraction not always coinciding (in consequence of the moon’s irregular motion in longitude) with the moon’s greatest diameter. This constitutes a 'physical libration, as inequalities in lon¬ gitude, by enabling us to see more or less of the lunar hemisphere diametrically opposed to us, con¬ stitute an optical libration, or apparent to-and-fro motion on her axis. In this investigation Lagrange first used the combination of D’Alembert’s Principle with that of Virtual Velocities, afterwards fully ex¬ panded in the Mecanique Analytique.3 Lagrange was happy in passing his days with (58.) 1 No reasonable doubt exists as to the stability of the planetary system to which our earth belongs, as it is at present consti¬ tuted. To what extent the laws of order which we observe in it might be transgressed with impunity, it is more difficult to say",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The investigations of Laplace and Lagrange assume the motion of the planets in one direction, and their moderate excentri- cities and inclinations, as conditions of the guarantee of stability. But it does not appear by any means certain that all these conditions are essential, and consequently the argument which has been sometimes employed, that the concurrence of many in¬ dependent circumstances were requisite to the stability of the system, is at least incomplete.

Though patronized by the despotic Frederick, and lodged in her palace by the gentle queen of Louis XVI., he escaped the misfortunes of almost every one of his contempora¬ ries, including Laplace, Lavoisier, and Delambre ; he retained his scientific appointments throughout all the frenzy of the French Revolution. His mildness of disposition and disinterested devotion to science, more than the European celebrity of his name, con¬ tributed to this result. He was equally fortunate in his scientific relations. Euler, D’Alembert, and Laplace, whilst they were emphatically his rivals, were also his sincere friends. If he ever felt jealousy, it was perhaps towards those who, he thought, at¬ tained too easily by circumstances to a high reputa¬ tion : Monge seems to have been of this number. It is remarkable that for a series of years Lagrange di¬ verted his mind altogether from mathematics, and studied chemistry, natural history, and even meta¬ physics.

"(60.) Pierre Simon Laplace has generally, and not Laplace. without reason, been considered as a sort of exemplar or type of the highest class of mathematical natural philosophers of this, or rather the immediately preced¬ ing age. The causes of this, and the degree in which it is warranted, we shall endeavour to state towards the close of this section. In the meantime, finding it quite impossible within our prescribed limits to notice, ever so briefly, all his more material investigations, we shall select three or four marked by their ori¬ ginality and general interest. Such are, 1. His im¬ provements of the lunar theory. 2. His discovery of the cause of the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn’s motions. 3. His theory of the tides. 4","Laplace, Laplace, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"(61.) First, then, we are to speak of the improve- mentsln"" ments of the lunar theory effected by him. The ap- the Lunar plication of Newton’s own principles to the perfecting Theory. 0f the theory of the moon’s motion has been related in Sir John Leslie’s Dissertation, and so far as the labours of Clairaut, D’Alembert, Euler, and Mayer, are concerned, belongs distinctly to the middle por¬ tion of the last century. The errors of Mayer’s tables little exceeded one minute of space, which was twice more accurate than in Halley’s time. With one important exception, the main. outstanding dif¬ ferences between theory and observation had disap¬ peared. The eclipses recorded in the Arabic and Chaldean annals could not '(as Halley first observed) be correctly explained by the motion of the moon as given by recent tables. At length it became admit¬ ted that the mean motion of the moon has been accelerated from century to century by a minute quantity, which, in the lapse of thousands of years, has become recognisable. It amounts to this, that the moon comes to the meridian two hours sooner than she would have done had her present period remained invariable from the earliest astronomical records of eclipses. It is at once evident how delicate a test this must be of changes otherwise imperceptible",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The effect on the dimension of the moon’s orbit maybe thus expressed, that at each lunation she approaches nearer to the earth than during the last by one-four¬ teenth of an inch! thus describing a spiral of almost infinitely slow convergence. The minuteness of the effect may be illustrated by the shortening of the pendulum of a clock by an amount absolutely in¬ sensible, which yet, after days and weeks, will alter by many seconds the time shown by the hands. Secular After several unsuccessful speculations as to accelera- the cause of this anomaly, Laplace, in 1787, thus sa- ^n°f lhe tisfactorily accounts for it:—It is well known that the sun’s attraction on the earth and moon lessens, on the whole, the tendency of the latter to the former, and lengthens permanently the lunar period. But, so far as this effect is uniform, it does not directly appear. The effect is greater, however, when the earth is near the sun than when it is farther off",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Laplace’s discovery, however, shows that the acce¬ leration has a limit, depending on that of the ex- centricity of the earth’s orbit, which having reached its minimum, the lunar mean motion will begin to be retarded, and will continue so through a vast cycle of ages, and so on alternately. Theory enables us to assign, with considerable accuracy, the amount of the acceleration, which is now about lO'' of lon¬ gitude in a century.1 Besides this very satisfactory discovery, Laplace investigated three of the lunar inequalities in a man¬ ner leading to curious and unexpected results. Two of these depend on the spheroidal figure of the earth","Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"The nutation of the earth’s axis, which is due to the attraction of the moon on the protuberant equatoreal parts of the earth, is exactly reproduced by the equi¬ valence of action and reaction in the movements of the lunar orbit, only less perceptible in degree on account of the length of the leverage at which they are effected. The inequality of the moon’s motion in latitude may be used to determine the degree of compression of our globe at the poles. Laplace de¬ duced from the Greenwich observations of the moon the fraction and, from a relative inequality in longitude, ; a coincidence really astonishing, not only as between themselves, but also when compared with the mean result of laborious investigations by actual measurement of the earth’s surface. The other result we referred to was the determination from the lunar theory of the solar parallax,—in other words, the distance of the earth from the sun, which enters into the expression of a certain inequality of the moon’s motion in longitude. From the observed amount of this inequality, Laplace obtained a value of the solar parallax exactly coincident with that obtained with so much labour on occasion of the transit of Venus in 1769. Strange and admirable result (as Laplace himself remarks), that the astro¬ nomer, immured in his observatory, and watching our satellite through his telescopes, and reading the re¬ sult by the aid of mathematical analysis and the theory of gravitation, should be able to determine the figure of our earth, and its distance from the sun, with perhaps quite as great accuracy as by any direct measurements. Truly the wonders of fact exceed those of fiction, and the divinations of true science may match the pretensions of her counterfeit, astro- logy- In conclusion of this subject, I regret that space (64.) does not allow me to advert particularly to Laplace’s The?ry ,of remarkable success in accounting for some singular satellites, peculiarities in the system of Jupiter’s satellites, arising from, and partly occasioning, an exact com- mensurability in the periods of some of them (which Sir John Herschel has lately observed to hold also in the Saturnian system in a somewhat different manner), a case which we have seen to be especially excluded in the instance of the planets, and which has been pronounced by a very competent judge (Mr Airy) to be “ the most curious and complicated sys¬ tem that has ever been reduced to calculation.” It ought to be stated, however, that Laplace’s dis¬ coveries were based upon a previous and highly original investigation of Lagrange","Laplace, Laplace, Laplace, Jupiter, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America

"Halley had ascertained, that by comparing mo- (66.) dern with the most ancient observations of Jupiter and^lsgtory of Saturn, the mean motion of the former planet had been qualities *; accelerated, and that of the latter retarded. Lambert remarked subsequently that, if we confine ourselves to modern observations alone, an opposite change would appear to be in progress. The amount of the error of the tables was so considerable (amounting to 20' or more in the middle of the eighteenth century, and capable, in fact, of becoming much larger), as to have been (along with the apsidal motion of the lunar orbit) one of the first subjects of anxiety and specu¬ lation to geometers, when the Newtonian theory came fairly into discussion. For nearly forty years this stubborn inequality was vainly attempted to be ac¬ counted for by Euler, Clairaut, D’Alembert, Lagrange, and by Laplace himself,, before the latter hit upon the true cause of the anomaly. It was long, and naturally, believed to be a properly secular inequa¬ lity, arising from the average mutual effects of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, though Lambert’s re¬ mark rendered this less probable. - It was in the course of the consequent research that Laplace proved that the mutual action of the.two planets could produce We here add that very recently Mr Adams has discovered that Laplace, and also his followers, in confining their at¬ tention to the radial effect of the sun’s interference with the lunar motions, as affected by the excentricity of the earth’s orbit, have unwarrantably assumed that the area described by the moon a unit of time is invariable. He finds, on the contrary, tan¬ gential perturbations depending on the same cause, and sensibly modifying the amount of secular mean motion deduced from theory.—(Philosophical Transactions, 1853.) 816 MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE","Jupiter, Laplace, Jupiter, Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"no 'permanent alteration of tlie mean motion of either; a conclusion which, as we have seen in the last section, he afterwards generalized for the pla¬ netary system. Several other memoirs by Lagrange and himself followed; and when the question be¬ came thus narrowed to periodic perturbations only, Laplace, with characteristic ardour and resolution, determined to search out every term which could affect the result; an irksome task, less congenial to the gene¬ ralizing spirit of Lagrange. He had already noticed, in his memoir of 1773, that Euler and Lagrange had, in their researches on this very subject, omitted terms, multiplied by sines and cosines of very small angles, which yet might, in the process of integration, be¬ come considerable by the largeness of the coefficients",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Eleven years later he detected, in the expansion of the mutual perturbation of Jupiter and Saturn, terms of this kind. The coefficient (or maximum value of the term) is in this case divided by the square1- of the same quantity which renders the angle under the sine or cosine small. These terms were indeed likewise multiplied by the cubes of the excentricity, or like small quantities ; but notwithstanding this, by reason of the small divisor just mentioned, they were capable of attaining a formidable magnitude ; in the case of Jupiter, to 21', and of Saturn, to 48' or 49'. That so small a force should produce so large an effect is due to the very long period of the most considerable portion of this inequality, which, in fact, led to its being confounded with perturbations properly secu¬ lar. The period of complete recurrence of the effects is about 920 years; and during half this time the motion of one planet is being constantly accelerated, and that of the other retarded; during the other half the action is reversed. An effect continually in¬ creasing or diminishing for so long a time, and be¬ tween the two most massive of the planetary bodies, is evidently liable to become considerable. The maximum displacement of Jupiter and Saturn Laplace found by calculation to have occurred in 1560, explaining the peculiarity above mentioned in the comparison of ancient with modern observa¬ tions","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"When we look to the physical cause of the large¬ ness of these particular perturbative terms, it is found to be this ;—that the period of revolution of Jupiter compared to that of Saturn, is almost as the num¬ bers 2 and 5 :—-in other words to the near commen- surability of the mean motions. Were they exactly in proportion to these numbers, formidable and per¬ manent changes would possibly result in the orbits",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"As it is, the planets come into conjunction when Jupiter has completed 5 revolutions, and about ^th more; Saturn 2 revolutions, and 3\th more. Consequently the point of conjunction travels round the circumfer¬ ence after about 44 conjunctions have occurred, which requires nearly 2700 years. But a little considera¬ tion will show that conjunctions occur successively at three nearly equidistant points of the circumference; consequently the two planets will have been presented to one another in every possible variety of configu¬ ration, when the point of conjunction has travelled one-third round the circumference, that is in about 900 years",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"The effect of this great improvement in the (68.) Theory of Jupiter and Saturn was, that the most an¬ cient observations were completely reconciled with the modern, and the modern with one another; the errors of the tables were immediately reduced to one-tenth of their former amount, and soon after to much less",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"III. The third topic which I must shortly discuss in (69.) connection with the career of Laplace, is the Theory Theory of of the Tides. the Tides- The Newtonian Theory of the Tides has been ex- (70.) plained in Mr Playfair’s Dissertation, but its progress Newton’s, during the 18 th century has not been adverted to in or the continuation by Sir John Leslie.

"The Tidal Theory of Newton and Bernouilli (71.) presumes the earth to be at rest; and also the watersIts results, of the ocean to be at rest, and at every moment in a state of equilibrium between the force of gravity, tending to the earth’s centre, and the lesser forces tending towards the sun and moon. That a theory, founded on suppositions so far from the truth (not to mention the irregular distribution of sea and land on the earth’s surface), should in any manner or degree represent correctly what happens, may be matter of just surprise. The leading phenomena are however tolerably consistent with it; the dependence of the great tides on the moon’s position with respect to the meridian of the port; the spring and neap tides when the sun’s action and that of the moon conspire with or oppose one another; the priming and lagging of the tides depending on the displacement of the vertex of the compound ellipsoid due to the combined effect of the sun’s and moon’s attraction, depending therefore on the moon’s elongation from the sun ; the effects of the moon being in the nearer or remoter part of her orbit; all these facts are indicated by the Equilibrium Theory (as it has been termed), and are also results of observation. The theory, however, does not give the true depth of tide, nor (except in casual instances) does the time of high and low water coincide with theory ; besides many minor imperfections",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

This he did in a series of memoirs, more systematically condensed in the Traite de Mecanique Celeste, and it may safely be affirmed that no other mathematician of his day was equal to the labours and disappointments of an investigation attended with every species of difficulty, in which each result must be attained by a combina¬ tion of general sagacity with mathematical rigour, and for the verification of which observations were yet in a great measure wanting. The Theory of the Tides was, upon the whole, the most arduous and compli¬ cated problem which could well be conceived, in a branch of science (hydrodynamics) hitherto remark¬ ably little successful in predicting the results of the most simple and arbitrarily selected experiments",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Three^he tidal effects are divided by Laplace into three classes of c^asses > the distinction of which, however, cannot be Tides. called a discovery of his. The first class are inde¬ pendent of the earth’s rotation, and are practically insignificant. The second class includes the diurnal tide occurring once in about 24 hours. Concerning it, Laplace draws this conclusion, that its rise and fall (not, however, its horizontal motion) are insensible if the depth of the ocean is uniform ;a and being practi¬ cally insensible in most latitudes, we have thence an argument of more or less weight for a general tendency to uniformity in the depth of the sea. The third class of tides are the ordinary semi-diurnal tides. They afford, as Newton acutely perceived, the most direct and attainable measure of the relative at¬ tractions of the sun and moon. We have the sum of these attractions at the conjunctions and oppositions of the luminaries, and the difference when they are 90° apart; and a higher maximum when both bodies are without latitude. From the observation of the tides on the Severn near Bristol, Newton computed the relative action of the moon and sun to be as 4""48 to 1 ; but this value is much too great, and gave far too large a relative mass to the moon. The result in the harbour of Brest, from observations made under Laplace’s direction, is about 2-90 to 1; and the moon’s mass y^th that of the earth, agreeing almost identically with that deduced from the nutation of the earth’s axis caused by her attraction. Observa¬ tions at London and Liverpool reduced by Sir John Lubbock and Dr Whewell give about 2-66 to l.2 From the general theory of Laplace, the follow- (76.) ing results have been deduced with confidence :—(1.)

"In the application of his theory to special cases, (77.) Laplace is compelled to have recourse to an assump¬ tion entirely arbitrary—namely, that the periodic fluctuations, however otherwise modified by circum¬ stances, recur in the same periods as the causes to which they are due. In this manner he conciliates the results of observation with his theory, which the latter would have been altogether incompetent to predict",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"The general merits of Laplace’s theory we will sum (78.) up in the words of Mr Airy, who, of all his succes- Character sors, has probably most attentively studied it:—“ If, °f L^' ",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"gation, we consider its general plan and objects, we must allow it to be one of the most splendid works of the greatest mathematician of the past age. To appreciate this, the reader must consider—first, the boldness of the writer who, having a clear under¬ standing of the gross imperfection of the methods of his predecessors, had also the courage deliberately to take up the problem on grounds fundamentally correct (however it might be limited by suppositions afterwards introduced); secondly, the general diffi- •d 1 Dr \oung ^sserts that the conclusion will not hold unless the depth be also evanescent.

The last point alone, in our opinion, gives a greater claim for reputation than the boasted explana¬ tion of the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn.” 1 We must, however, qualify this eulogy by adding, in the words of the same writer, that Laplace’s theory, though based on sounder principles than the equili¬ brium theory, “ has far too little regard to the actual state of the earth to serve for the explanation of even the principal phenomena of the tides.” It is, in fact, like many other productions of the same age and school, a great display of ingenuity and mathemati¬ cal skill, which hardly yields a single result worthy of confidence, or agreeing with nature, except by the abandonment of its deductive rigour, or a concealed induction backwards from the phenomena to be ac¬ counted for. The same amount of skill and resource which Mr Airy has shown in adapting it to his own views, and to recent observations, would probably have sufficed to construct a theory from the founda¬ tion.

The former has constructed maps of “ cotidal lines. lines,” which, indicating the relative time of high water in different parts of the globe, give us a gra¬ phic conception of the course and propagation of the tidal wave. The tides of the Eastern Pacific are but little known ; but a vast wave advances northwards between Australia and Africa, diverted or retarded by the obstacles it meets with in the Indian Archi¬ pelago. Another (and to us the most important) branch sets from south to north up the vast canal of the Atlantic, where it is gradually complicated by local tides, having their origin in the wide expanse between Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. The two sets of waves sometimes reinforce, sometimes oppose, one another; they are prolonged to the western shores of England and Norway, where the tidal im¬ pulse arrives 24 hours after it passed the Cape of Good Hope. It is propagated most rapidly at a dis¬ tance from coasts, and is retarded in narrows and shallows. It sends offshoots into every bay and strait, always greatly retarded in point of time (ap¬ parently by friction), but often increased in elevation by concentration of the effect in a gradually narrow¬ ing channel, as we see in the exaggerated tides of the river Amazon, the Severn, and the Bay of Fundy","Newton, Severn, Bay","US,AU,MX,NO,PH",8,"United States,Australia,Mexico,Norway,Philippines","North America,Oceania,North America,Europe,Asia"
"The same place may be the seat of several tides at once, which may increase or destroy one another; thus, a small tide is propagated through the Straits of Dover as far as the Dutch coast, where it only arrives simultaneously with the principal wave, which has made the entire tour of Great Britain",Dover,"US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"As regards the progress of theory, Dr Thomas Th^^of Young, whose character as one of the greatest Dr Young, philosophers of the past age we shall have to con¬ sider in another chapter, next after Laplace grappled with the difficulties of this arduous subject.

"Hundreds of memoirs relating to them, dispersed through many volumes in different languages, written with varying ability, in various stages of scientific pro¬ gress, and with differing notations, presented a mass of reading almost beyond the reach of the most reso¬ lute student.

Laplace has been too sparing of his cita¬ tions and acknowledgments, and a consequence of this literary avarice has been that he is sometimes considered as more of a compiler and less of a dis¬ coverer than is justly his due. For however ill he could have dispensed with the skilful preparations of his illustrious rivals and contemporaries, his pre¬ eminent sagacity furnished on several occasions the key-stone of the arch which imparted at once strength and completeness to the fabric. We have seen in the last section that though the credit of the theo¬ rems respecting the stability of the solar system is very generally attributed to Lagrange, who, indeed, prin¬ cipally furnished the methods, and gave great gene- yet gives rality to the results, yet the capital discovery of the him justly invariability of the major axes of the planetary orbits putatioiT"" ^ue Eaplace. It was he, again, who removed from the theory of gravity the two greatest and most impracticable difficulties with which it had ever been assailed—the anomaly of the lunar ac¬ celerations, and the great inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, and by so doing rendered it almost infinitely improbable that any future discrepancy should more than temporarily embarrass a theory which had tri¬ umphed in succession over such formidable causes of doubt. True that Lagrange, in his memoir of 1783, had come within a single step of the first of these discoveries, and, by a process of exclusion, had almost forced attention in the right direction respecting the latter ; still Laplace seized the prize in both cases, after a fair, prolonged, and arduous struggle. Now these three discovei'ies wrere the greatest in physical astronomy between those of D’Alembert and Clairaut on the precession of the equinoxes, the motion of the lunar apse, and the periodicity of comets,—and that of Leverrier and Adams on the perturbations of Uranus about a century later","Laplace, Jupiter, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"The universal testimony of mathematicians is to _ the effect that Lagrange was unrivalled as a pure compared analyst, in his power of generalization, and in the with La- inherent elegance of his methods ; that Laplace, £range- with nearly equal power in using the calculus, had more sagacity in its mechanical and astronomical applications, or rather, perhaps, we should say, in directing it to the discrimination of causes, and the revelation of consequences",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"The weak point of his scientific character was one so (92.) natural, and perhaps so inseparable from his prevail Jj0ve ing studies, that it is not fair to criticise it too severely, dispfay! This was a love of analytical display in treating ques¬ tions which it rather embarrassed than illustrated; and generally, a disposition to overrate the sphere of mathematical discovery. This he had in common with Euler, to whom he was very superior in physical attainments and sagacity. His language, and that of his eulogists,1 often amounts to the assumption that 1 For instance Arago says (speaking of the invariability of the major axes): “ Enfin par la toute-puissance d’une formula mathematique, le monde materiel se trouva raffermi sur ses fondements” (Annuaire, 1844, p. 304). This is indeed the idolatry of mathematics. Many examples may he found in Laplace’s writings on Probability ; which occasioned Mr Ellis to say of him, that “ to Laplace all the lessons of History were merely confirmations of the ‘ resultats de calcul.’ ” To the same effect was the mot of Napoleon, “ that Laplace carried into the art of government the principles of the infinitesimal calculus.” 822 MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE","Laplace, Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America

"The mathematical career of Legendre was less splendid than that of the other two whom we have just mentioned. He did not possess the wonderful powers of generalization of Lagrange, and he wanted the flexibility of mind, and the general physical knowledge, of Laplace. Legendre was very strictly a mathematician ; and he has been exceeded by none in the unquenchable zeal with which he pursued sub¬ jects of a dry and even repulsive character, often till he had hunted them down by sheer force of ap¬ plication, or, to adopt the metaphor applied to him by Lagrange, until he carried, sword in hand, the strong¬ hold which he besieged",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

"Rut to return to the labours of Legendre. The theory of the figure and attraction of the earth and of other planets naturally divides itself into two parts—(1.) the law of attraction of an ellipsoid on a material point without or within it; (2.) the figure of equilibrium of a fluid subjected to no forces but the mutual attractions of its particles, and the cen¬ trifugal force due to its rotation. The latter of these problems is still imperfectly solved, the former completely so, and that mainly in consequence of the labours of Legendre and Ivory.1 Though the services of Legendre are well known and admitted, the superior address of Laplace in the applications of mathematics has occasioned his re¬ ceiving the credit of what in some instances belonged to the former",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Maclaurin, by an exercise of synthetic skill not exceeded since the death of Newton, had demon¬ strated the attraction of an ellipsoid of revolution upon a material point anywhere within it or on its surface, as well as for an exterior point in the prolongation of its axis or in the plane of its equator. The same problem was afterwards ana¬ lytically solved by D’Alembert and Lagrange. In 1782, Legendre, by a profound and complicated analysis, obtained an expression, by means of series, for the attraction of an exterior particle generally, and he was the first to imagine and employ those artifices of calculation known usually by the name of “ Laplace’s functions.” Laplace .made a step towards the simplification of the expression of ex¬ terior attractions, but the complete solution was reserved for Mr Ivory, as I shall mention below","Newton, Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"We have seen that the attraction of an ellipsoid (104.) on a point within or at its surface had been assigned H!s by Maclaurin. The theorem in question enablesant The?r us at once to reduce the case ot an exterior attracted attraction point to that of a point on the surface of the ellipsoid.of Ellip- Suppose an ellipsoid having the same excentricity,80lds' and with the principal sections parallel to the first, but whose surface passes through the given exterior point. Let points on the surface whose co-ordinates parallel to the three axes of the respective solids are proportional to those axes be called corresponding points; then the attraction parallel to each axis which one of these bodies exerts on a point situated on the surface of the other is to the attraction of the latter on the “ corresponding point” of the sur¬ face of the former, as the product of the two other axes of the first ellipsoid is to the product of the two other axes of the second. By this means the attrac¬ tion on an exterior point is accurately expressed in terms of the attraction on an interior point, which is known. It is fair to add that both Legendre and Laplace had some glimpses of the principle, though they failed to apply it to the direct solution of the problem, and between the publication of their Me¬ moirs and that of Mr Ivory there elapsed nearly a quarter of a century",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

"tions, and attributed the error chiefly to the assump¬ tion of erroneous masses for Venus and Mars. But prolonged study satisfied him that it arose from a “long inequality,” arising from the mutual action of the Earth and Venus, similar in its nature to that men¬ tioned in Art. (66), as detected by Laplace in the case of Jupiter and Saturn. It arises from the cir¬ cumstance that eight times the orbital period of the Earth is almost equivalent to thirteen times that of Venus. Terms of the series expressive of the mu¬ tual action of the planets, which are divided by thir¬ teen times the mean motion of the former minus eight times the mean motion of the latter (which is a very small quantity), may consequently become consider¬ able ; still more, those involving the square of this quantity. Such terms belong to the fifth and higher orders of the excentricity, and would consequently be very minute indeed, but for the casual magnitude of their coefficient. The labour of tracing out and cal¬ culating the effects of these important terms from the vast mass of algebraic developments is enormously great,—much greater than in the corresponding case of Jupiter and Saturn. As the calculations are not very likely to be repeated, Mr Airy took extraordi¬ nary precautions in their verification. The period of the inequality depends, first, as has been explained in Art. (67), upon the period required to carry the point of conjunction of the two planets completely round the circumference. This period is no less than 270 years. The perturbation is of course mutual, and affects the place of Venus as well as of the Earth","Laplace, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America

The details are ar¬ ranged in so lucid a manner, as to court enquiry from those interested in verifying them ; and though the readers of so abstruse and indeed repulsive a work must be few indeed, it has already proved of essential service in the way which was intended •—the improvement of the lunar tables. The ap¬ proximations by series are in all cases carried to the fifth powers of small quantities, and, in some in¬ stances, to the seventh powers. Sir John Herschel has expressed in forcible and picturesque language the nature of what is wanting to the completeness of Laplace’s investigations and which M. Plana has supplied, as regards the theory of the moon’s motions: •—“ In the Mecanique Celeste, we admire the elegance displayed in the alternate interlinking and develop¬ ment of formulse, and exult in the power of the ana¬ lytical methods used; but when we come to the statement of numerical results, we quail before the vast task of filling in those distant steps ; and while cloud rolls after cloud in majesty and darkness, we feel our dependence on the conclusions attained to partake of superstitious trust, or of amicable confidence, rather than of clear and demonstrative conviction.”1 The courage of M. Plana did not “ quail” before the serried ranks of symbolic legions",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"He attacked them first, and finally became their com¬ mander. But more than this ; on the same high authority, “ his analysis is always graceful, his com¬ binations well considered, and his conceptions of the ultimate results to be expected from them perfectly just, and justified by the results when obtained.” I may here mention that M. Plana, in conjunc¬ tion with M. Carl ini of Milan, undertook the calcula¬ tion of the moon’s motions from theory alone (that is, Lunar with only the fundamental constants required to be Jable3 given by observation), in compliance with a pro-Theory gramme issued by the French Academy of Sciences alone, on the proposition of Laplace ; and that a French Carlini— geometer, M. Damoiseau, on the same occasion, pro- amoiseau- duced an independent investigation with very elabo¬ rate and valuable tables founded thereon",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

M. Poisson and Sir J. Lubbock showed that the anomaly could not be due to the solar action, nor yet to the irregularity of the Earth’s figure. The planetary attractions, then, alone re¬ mained. M. Hansen discovered two independent in¬ equalities due to the action of Venus. One of these is an indirect (or, as it is sometimes called, reflected') effect depending on the change of form of the Earth’s orbit by the attraction of Venus, which, of course, modifies slightly the solar perturbation of the Moon’s longitude. It is, in fact, a secondary consequence of long inequality of Venus and the Earth investigated by Mr Airy [Art. (115)], and has the same period, namely, about 240 years. Its greatest amount is 23"",2. The other inequality discovered by Hansen is of a still more curious and complicated kind, which goes on increasing for 2000 lunations, when it at¬ tains a maximum value of 27""'4 in longitude (al¬ though the perturbation of the radius vector does not exceed 10 feet), after which it diminishes for an equal space of time",Lubbock,US,8,United States,North America

"(132.) Since the publication of the Principia, or rather we should say since the great theory contained in that work had fully attracted the sympathies of thoughtful and able men, nearly the whole science of physical astronomy consisted in the solution of one vast and intricate problem, which has been called the “ Problem of the Three Bodies.” To this were bent the powers of Clairaut, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Plana, Hansen, and so many more. “ Let three bodies be placed and move in a given manner in space and attract one another by the Newtonian law, to determine the motions as affected by their mutual influence.” The problem solved independently by the two analysts whose names stand at the head of this section is this, “ Given two bodies (the Sun and Uranus) and their relative motion, to find at any moment the position of a third body whose attraction shall be required to account for those motions.” To have solved this new and far more difficult problem (under certain limitations) is a triumph altogether unlike in kind to any of the other brilliant successes of which we have had to speak in the preceding pages",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Bouvard of the Observatory of Paris, a most able cal¬ culator, had exhausted every resource in improving the Tables of Uranus. A few years more gave that patient astronomer the mortification of seeing his tables as obsolete as those of his predecessors, and nu¬ merous surmises were circulated as to possible expla¬ nations of the anomaly: a failure in the law of gra- Hypotheses vity, cometary perturbation, a resisting medium, and, finally, the presence of an unseen planet, were amongst these guesses. The last and most plausible of these hypotheses occurred to many; amongst others, to Mr Hussey in England, M. Bouvard in France, and later to M. Bessel in Germany.1 The first of these astronomers actually consulted Mr Airy, in 1834, on the possibility of predicting the place of the perturbing planet from theory, and then disco¬ vering it by observation. Mrs Somerville, in 1836, gave a precise expression to the same idea.2 From this time the subject could not be lost sight of. The errors of the tables which in 1821 were insen¬ sible, increased in 1830 to 15"" or 20"", and in 1845 1 Clairaut, nearly a century before, in calculating the return of Halley’s comet, hinted at the possible perturbation due to a planet superior to Saturn",Paris,"FR,DE,US",8,"France,Germany,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"829 (133.) M. Lever- rier’s inves ligations; amounted to two minutes of longitude. M.

Eugene Bouvard in the same career, who appears to have followed it with much zeal and intelligence, and in 1845 constructed new tables of Uranus. But by this time two geometers had separately and inde¬ pendently undertaken the problem, with the deter¬ mination of finding, if possible, a physical solution of all this perplexity. The earliest in point of date was Mr Adams, a young graduate of Cambridge; the other was M. Leverrier of Paris, whose attention was directed to the subject by M. Arago. As the researches of M. Leverrier, though second in point of time, occasioned the actual recognition of the planet, and thus stamped the correctness of the solution with success, we shall consider them in the first instance","Eugene, Cambridge, Paris",US,8,United States,North America
"M. Leverrier is, we believe, a native of St Lo in Normandy, a province which has been singularly productive of eminent men (Laplace and Fresnel were of the number). With no advantages, but the reverse, he won a high position at entering the polytechnic school, which he constantly maintained",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"He at first, we believe, attached himself to chemis¬ try, but his taste for physical astronomy was soon developed, and was advanced entirely by his private efforts. It is a peculiarity of the mode of culti¬ vating the sciences in Paris, that such abstruse and difficult studies are not merely engaged in tem¬ porarily for purposes of academial distinction, but that they actually become a “ carriere” or calling, and are pursued in that methodical manner for which the French are distinguished. In 1845, when he com¬ menced the careful examination of the theory of Uranus, M. Leverrier was already favourably known by his researches on comets, and on the orbit of Mercury,but especially by immense calculations, con¬ nected with the secular inequalities of the planets, by which his ability and hardihood in computation had been thoroughly exercised. He began his new en¬ quiry with the method and intrepidity of calculation which distinguish him. He revised with the most minute care the observations of Uranus, and computed afresh every sensible perturbation which theory recognised as arising from known planets",Paris,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

John’s College, Cambridge, in 1841, formed the de¬ sign of detecting the position of a perturbing planet which should account for the anomalous motions of Uranus. Fie made a preliminary essay on the pro¬ blem in 1843, assuming the distance of the suspected body from the Sun to be double that of Uranus",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"I learn from good authority that he obtained a place for the unseen planet not very different from that which he finally adopted. Early in 1844 he ob¬ tained from Greenwich the valuable series of places of Uranus which were afterwards in like manner ap¬ plied for by M. Leverrier. In September 1845, he communicated to Professor Challis the elements of the new planet’s orbit (neglecting the inclination) and an ephemeris of its geocentric place; and in October he transmitted the elements alsotothe Astronomer Royal. Mr Adams This, it will be observed, was soon after M. Leverrier’s preceded attention was first directed to the subject, and nine r/r months previous to his announcement of the locality similar in- where the new body should be sought. Mr Adams yestiga- afterwards repeated his calculation with a mean dis-tlon ’ tance ^gth less than before, and considered himself warranted, by the improvement thus produced on the residual errors, in inferring that a farther consider¬ able diminution of the mean distance would satisfy the observations still better. This was communicated to Mr Airy on the 2d September 1846 ; subsequently therefore to the publication of M. Leverrier’s Ele¬ ments. Mr Adams, in communicating his results (at a later time) to the Astronomical Society, with charac¬ teristic modesty says, “ I mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of M. Leverrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honors of the discovery, lor there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr Galle.” And such is no doubt the fact. The priority of Mr (1^0-) Adams m the mathematical investigation is as certain net was not as that the researches of M. Leverrier alone produced discovered the discovery of Neptune. Even the search for the in conse- planet which took place in August and September (lueI1Ce• 1846 at Cambridge by Professor Challis, was not oc¬ casioned by Mr Adams’ researches only ; it was the near coincidence of the longitude assigned by Mr Adams in the previous October with that published by M. Leverrier in June 1846 which induced Mr Airy to suggest this investigation of the heavens, and to oiler (if need were) himself to bear the ex¬ pense. Had the planet been discovered1 at Cambridge The planet was indeed seen at Cambridge by Mr Challis, for it was recorded more than once amongst the numerous fixed sars whose places were taken down in the progress of the search; but as the comparisons of the “ sweeus” were not made at the time, the discovery was anticipated by M. Galle. A Chap. II., § 5.] PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY.—M. LEVERRIER—MR ADAMS","Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridge, Galle","US,LK",8,"United States,Sri Lanka","North America,Asia"
"(142.) I have endeavoured to state correctly (with due re¬ gard to the limits of this essay) the main facts of the most curious case of double discovery which, perhaps, the history of science presents ; and happily as to the facts, down to the minutest detail, no discrepancy of opinion ever existed. Different minds will, with per¬ fect truth, attach more or less distinction to the two illustrious rivals,—neither of whom has for an in¬ stant lowered the dignity of his position by one ungenerous expression,—but that the absolute merit of both is of the very highest character is on all hands admitted. “ The names of M. Leverrier and Mr Adams,” said Sir John Herschel, addressing the Astronomical Society, “ which Genius and Destiny have joined, I shall by no means put asunder ; nor will they ever be pronounced apart so long as lan¬ guage shall celebrate the triumphs of Science in her sublimest walks.” But before closing, I must briefly state how far the orbit of the planet Neptune, when discovered, vatjon 0f realized the previsions of theory. A fortunate cir- Neptune as cum stance rendered it easy to obtain at an early a fixed star- period a correct knowledge of the elements. It seems that the planet Neptune was observed by Lalandeat Paris on the 8th and 10th May 1795, and entered as a fixed star, notvjithstanding a distinct change of place between the observations, actually corresponding to what the planet should have had.1 But such an oversight had been made by Lemonnier in the case of Uranus. By means of this observation of fifty years back, the orbit was easily computed. It is a singular and startling fact, that, except as regards the longitude on the orbit, the other elements computed from observation were somewhat widely different from those assigned by M. Leverrier and Mr Adams",Paris,US,8,United States,North America

"(150.) Nevil Maskelyne, born in 1732, and educated at Maskelyne; Cambridge, was early attached to astronomical pur¬ suits. After various minor services connected chiefly with navigation and the discovery of the longitude, he attained the honourable post of Astronomer Royal, w hich he filled from 1765 till 1811 with distinguished success. His immediate predecessor was Dr Bliss, who held the office for but three years and without dis¬ tinction. Practically, Maskelyne may be said to have succeeded Bradley, probably the greatest astronomer wffiom England has yet seen, whose discoveries have been recorded in the last Dissertation, and whose observations, through a variety of circumstances, were destined rather for the benefit of the nineteenth cen¬ tury than for his own. Maskelyne wisely recollected that the observatory was mainly founded for the improvement of navigation,1 2 and one of his earliest labours was the establishment in 1767 of the “Nau¬ tical Almanac,” a work based on the best astronomi¬ cal observations and of the highest service to seamen","Cambridge, Bradley",US,8,United States,North America
"“ During Maskelyne’s long tenure of office he was entirely devoted to its duties, making himself all the most delicate observations, particularly those of the moon, and rarely quitting the observatory except to attend the meetings of the Royal Society. The per¬ fect method and continuity of his observations give to them a great value, especially for the correction of the Lunar Tables, in which respect they are indeed without a parallel. But the regularity of their publication was not their least merit. Four large folio volumes include the patient labours of a life (for he had but one assistant). Delambre in his character of Maskelyne says, that if through some catastrophe the whole materials of science should be lost, except these volumes, they would suffice to re¬ construct entirely the edifice of modern astronomy.’,2 hisobser ^ac^’ on Maskelyne’s accession, the only methodi- vations at ca^ publication which had issued from Greenwich Greenwich. Observatory was the “ Historia Celestis” of Flam¬ steed ; Halley’s, Bradley’s, and Bliss’s observations remained in manuscript. A like fate attended most of the foreign astronomical observations ; labours the most irksome and conscientious lie buried in piles of MS. useless to science, and which therefore might almost as well have never been made. This is particularly the case with the Parisian observa¬ tions (as the impartial Delambre records with pain), commenced even before the time of Flamsteed ; but which, owing to this cause principally, have remained even to the present day (and it is forty years since Delambre wrote his patriotic protest) without con¬ tributing materially to advance astronomy. Let it then be recorded to the honour of Maskelyne, that this important step of regular and full publication at the public expense was entirely due to him. His places of the sun, moon, and planets, were the founda¬ tion of the improved theories of physical astronomy, then more ably cultivated on the Continent than in Britain, and of the tables also chiefly furnished by German and French computers",Bradley,"US,DE,FR",8,"United States,Germany,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"I. The determination of the Lunar Orbit from Ob¬ servation and its application to Navigation.—Though astronomy owes (as we have already said) much to Maskelyne in the exact determination of the places of the sun, planets, and the most conspicuous fixed stars, the comparison of the Lunar place with the tables was by far the most arduous and the most im¬ portant of his undertakings. It was the most ardu¬ ous, because, from the extreme complexity of the moon’s motions, every part of its orbit must be nar¬ rowly watched, requiring the astronomer’s presence at his instruments at all possible hours during the course of a lunation, these motions being subject to important changes which recur every nineteen years, besides others of yet far longer duration. It was Maskelyne’s good fortune, and at the same time the reward of his perseverance, to watch three revolu¬ tions of the lunar nodes. He did not content him¬ self, however, with making observations ; he contri¬ buted in every possible way to the improvement of the tables of the moon’s motion. He was in con¬ stant communication with Mayer, one of the ablest astronomers of his day, and he directed the calcula¬ tion of Bradley’s observations by Mason, for the far¬ ther improvement of Mayer’s Tables. Maskelyne’s own observations, to the number of at least 5000, were used by Burg in his excellent tables of the moon which have even yet been hardly surpassed; but their full value has only been tested recently by the 1 In the warrant appointing Flamsteed to be the Royal “ Astronomical Ohservator,” his duty is declared to he “ to rectify the tables of the motions of the heavens and the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude at sea, for perfecting the art of navigation.” 2 From an article on Greenwich Observatory in the Edinburgh Review, written by the author of this Dissertation","Bradley, Mason",US,8,United States,North America

"II. The determination of the Attraction of Sche- hallien, and of the Earth’s Density.—The deviation of the plumb-line from the vertical by the neighbour¬ hood of a mountain had been pointed out by Newton1 as a direct consequence, and also as a test, of the principle that gravity resides in every part of the earth as well as in the earth as a whole. Bouguer had the merit of pointing out the form in which the experiment might be made, and of making the trial, though in a rude and insufficient manner, in the Peruvian Andes in 1738. He observed the effect of the mountain on the south side only, but at two sta¬ tions unequally distant from its centre of attraction",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The numerical result being (as the author himself admitted) without value, Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society in 1772 to repeat the observation on some British mountain. A “ Committee of Attrac¬ tion” was named, which, besides Maskelyne, included Cavendish, Franklin, and Horsley. Cavendish, as might have been expected, took an earnest part in it",Franklin,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"The search for a suitable hill was confided to Mr Charles Mason in 1773. Skiddaw and the York¬ shire Hills were first thought of, but finally Sche- hallien in Perthshire was preferred.2 3 Thither Mas¬ kelyne himself proceeded in 1774, with his assistant Burrows, and by these two, with the aid of a local land-surveyor, the labour of the astronomical and chief geodetical operations, including the measure¬ ment of two base lines, was effected between the 30th June and the 24th October, notwithstanding the hindrances of a most unfavourable season",York,US,8,United States,North America
"This is the proper place to mention an experiment (156.) on the density of the Earth perhaps still more re- Ml^hpI1ven markable, devised by the Rev. Mr Michell, who con- ^sh’sexpe- structed the apparatus, but first put in practice by riment for Mr Cavendish in 1797-8. It consisted in measuring the same the force of gravitation between two spheres of such end‘ small size that they could be moved by the hand nearer to or farther from one another. The essen¬ tial part of the invention was to contrive a balance so delicate as to measure the almost inappreciable tendency of such small bodies to unite. Newton had shown that the attraction at the surface of any sphere is directly as its radius, which he observed must always be incomparably smaller than their tendency towards the earth, that is, their weight. In the largest and heaviest masses with which it has hither¬ to been found practicable to operate, this tendency 1 De Mundi Systemate, § 22. Newton, in a very remarkable passage of the Third Book of the Principia (Prop. X.), con¬ jectures that “ the quantity of matter in the earth may be five or six times greater than if the whole were composed of water.” A laughable mistake of Zach in his account of the Schehallien experiment (in his Attraction des Montagues) is commented on by Playfair in the Edinburgh Review. In a note to the word Schehallien, Zach says, “ Montague appelee dans le pays en langue Erse Maiden pap, qui veut dire orage perpetuel.” It is needless to add that these two alleged synonyms are different in¬ terpretations given by Gaelic scholars of the word. “ From this inaccuracy,” adds his reviewer, “ his residence in London ought to have delivered him, for though he could not learn there what was Erse, he might have learned what was English.” 3 Zach obtained the same result exactly by including all the observations, as Maskelyne had provisionally obtained by using only those stars on which he most depended","Newton, Newton, London","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"

Mitchell’s apparatus came first into the hands of Wollaston, then of Cavendish, who made the experi¬ ment. He used a very light rod of deal, six feet long, suspended by a fine silver or copper wire, forty inches long, within a wooden case to defend it from currents of air. At each end of the lever was hung a hall of lead, two inches in diameter, and by a simple con¬ trivance a pair of leaden spheres, weighing, together, 348 pounds, could be brought simultaneously into the neighbourhood of the balls (but outside the case), on opposite sides, so that their attractions might con¬ cur to swing the suspended lever out of the position of repose which it had previously taken up, under the action of the slight twisting force of the silver wire. A new position of rest was thus established, the small balls being pulled as much one way by the attraction of the spheres as they were urged in the opposite direction by the torsion of the wire. The position of repose being observed from a distance by a telescope (to avoid disturbance from the heat of the observer’s body), the great spheres were then changed in position so as to act upon the opposite sides of the small balls, from what they formerly did","Mitchell, Mitchell",US,8,United States,North America
"(158.) It would be difficult to mention in the whole range y re* of physics a more beautiful and more important ex¬ periment. It has been repeated since by Reich of Freiberg and Baily of London. The former obtained 5'44, the latter 5-66 for the Earth’s specific gravity; this last result being worthy of much confidence from the extraordinary care taken to avoid errors and to obtain independent values of the quantities sought.1 Maskelyne continued his zeal for the promotion of astronomy to the last. He superintended the publi¬ cation of 45 annual volumes of the Nautical Alma¬ nac. He left the whole of the observatory work in perfect order, and the greater part printed. He had the well-earned satisfaction of finding his observa¬ tions in request in every civilized country, the bases of the most useful tables, and the tests of the most advanced theories. He cultivated the friendly cor¬ respondence of astronomers in every country. Not given to change, he preserved the instruments and chief methods of the immortal Bradley ; but suffi¬ ciently alive to the necessity of progress in the sciences, he introduced many simple but practical im¬ provements in the art of observation. Even in his last years, satisfied that the celebrated quadrant of Bird was no longer the best instrument for its pur¬ pose, and was besides sensibly deteriorated by use, he adopted the circle instead (then recently come into notice, though first used more than a century before by Rbmer), and directed the construction of that by Troughton, though it was not placed at Greenwich until after his death, which occurred in 1811, in the 79 th year of his age.

"were the principal means of extricating him from his difficulties : hut his danger was often imminent, and he appears to have sometimes heard the dreadful words which, as an eloquent author has expressed it, were the last sounds that vibrated in the ear of many an unhappy victim.” The operations were actually sus¬ pended for a time hy a decree of Robespierre and his colleagues, who deposed Delambre, along with Laplace, Lavoisier, Borda, and others, from the Commission of Weights and Measures, as being deficient in “ re¬ publican virtues and their hatred of kings.” They were, however, resumed, and Delambre had finished his share of the work long before his colleague Me¬ chain, whose shorter task was conducted amidst a people rude and uneducated, indeed, yet far more to be trusted than were then those of the north. Me¬ chain was apparently wayward and impracticable, somewhat too aged for so great a work, yet a really good astronomer. The want of agreement to within 3"" of two sets of observations for latitude atBarcelona, the southern end of the arc at that time, led him to the suppression of one of them, and he was tormented ever after by the consciousness of the evasion, which deprived him of the tranquillity necessary to resume and complete his work, which was done chiefly by Delambre after vexatious delays.1 The error, which may be said to have cost Mechain his life, was pro¬ bably owing to the instrument employed on this sur¬ vey, the repeating circle of Borda, only fourteen inches diameter, with a rather weak telescope. The opinion generally entertained in Britain is, that the repeating circle was quite inadequate to the prodi¬ gious accuracy required of it, especially in the deter¬ mination of latitudes. The errors of mere division are often trivial compared to those inherent in other parts of an instrument. Of these a deficiency of op¬ tical power, and the want of absolute security of the clamps, upon which the entire success of the princi¬ ple of repetition depends, are amongst the most ob¬ vious. The arc was finally prolonged from Barcelona to Formentera by Biot and Arago in 1806. The conclusion of the survey was not destitute of the ad¬ venturous character of its commencement.

William Herschel, the third son, came to England in 1759 with his elder brother, and after struggling with many difficulties, found himself in comparatively comfort¬ able circumstances as an organist at Bath. In 1774 he had executed a reflecting telescope with his own hands, and soon acquired so much dexterity as to construct instruments of ten and twenty feet in focal length. In 1780 he contributed his first paper on the variable star in Cetus to the Royal Society, and the following year (13th March 1781) discovered the erratic body, which he at first took for a comet, but which proved to be a planet exterior to Saturn; the first addition therefore to the number of the primary planets since a period of an immemorial antiquity","Hanover, Bath, March","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"So fortunate a success made the name of Herschel speedily famous, and he was effectively befriended by George III., who brought him to live near Windsor, and gave him a pension.1 From this brief sketch it will appear how great were the obstacles which Herschel had to vanquish before he became a man of science, and that, besides the claims to distinction already enumerated, his knowledge and his skill were acquired in spite of every disadvantage","George, Windsor","ZA,US",8,"South Africa,United States","Africa,North America"
"Practical Astronomy naturally divides itself into two great branches, that which depends upon the use of the telescope merely; on the telescope and micrometer ; and that which determines the absolute places of the heavenly bodies, and requires the aids of divided instruments and a well furnished obser¬ vatory.

The discoveries of Aberra¬ tion and of Nutation by the latter may stand a com¬ parison with any in the history of science, but the resolution of Nebulae and the proof of the mutual connection of stars in binary systems are not less distinguished and original. Herschel would have gained a great reputation as an optician, merely by the wonderful improvement which he effected in the dimensions and magnifying power of telescopes, and by the skill with which he applied them to celestial observations. He would have stood still higher as an astronomer had he been merely the first observer of a new planet and of eight secondary ones, as well as of several comets, and the author of many nice 1 It may be doubted whether any other similar annuity was given at that period on scientific grounds alone, and it is difficult to estimate the amount of benefit thus conferred on astronomy, for nothing short of the entire devotion of a lifetime could have produced such results as we owe to Herschel.

"A theory or hypothesis in some respects similar (199.) had been previously expounded by Laplace in the Laplace’s concluding chapter of his Systeme du Monde.

He ascribes to Saturn’s ring a like origin. It required all the authority of a name like that of Laplace to circu¬ late a theory so bold, if not extravagant. He adhered, however (at that time), to the old idea of the consti¬ tution of nebula?, which he considered to be composed entirely of stars, and to be at once the most distant and the most massive aggregations of matter in the universe.

"But he prudently reserved his hypothesis for sidereal objects, and did not deduce from it a planetary cos¬ mogony. In the later editions of the Systeme du Monde, Laplace quotes Herschel’s observations in confirmation of his views, adopts the notion of a dif¬ fuse nebulous matter, and considers that an hypothesis arrived at by a “ remarkable coincidence” in oppo¬ site directions, is thereby invested with a great pro¬ bability",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

"I do not know whether Sir W. Herschel derived his first ideas on the subject either from English or German authors. His customary silence (which is to be regretted) on the history of his discoveries, leaves us in doubt of his originality. Be this as it may, he proceeded to test the reasonableness of the speculation, in that definite and thorough manner which was very characteristic of his genius. He pro¬ ceeded to number the stars after a fashion which, if the early attempt of Hipparchus was pronounced in its day impious, might well have been accounted, even in Herschel’s age, impossible. To use his own bold expression, he gauged the heavens, by counting the whole number of stars visible in the field of his 20-feet reflector as many times as possible, and in every region of the sky which was visible from Slough, distinguishing the results of each region. As it was impossible in one lifetime to accomplish the en¬ tire survey (for the complete sphere contains 883,000 fields of 15' each in diameter), he took an average for each region, and thus determined the general popula¬ tion of the sky in all directions. The result more than confirmed the suspicions of Wright and Lambert, and demonstrated a remarkable, and, on the whole, a steady law of decrease, from the central zone of the Milky Way in opposite directions, until we reach two poles, one in the Southern, the other in the Northern hemisphere, which are the localities poorest in stars","Slough, Wright","GB,US,UK,DE",8,"United Kingdom,United States,N/A,Germany","Europe,North America,N/A,Europe"

As nothing essential has been added to Herschel’s More recent discovery of the direction of the solar motion, we orfthe'same s^a^‘ ^ere refer once for all to the important confir- subject. mations which it has since received. Professor Ar- gelander, availing himself in 1835 of the improved state of astronomy since Bradley’s observations were made, and since their reduction by Bessel, considered the whole problem in a general and geometrical manner, including every well-determined proper mo¬ tion1 by means of appropriate equations of condition, which, being resolved by the method of least squares, give the direction of solar motion 261° IP of right ascension, and 30° 58' of north declination, differing respectively about 4° and 6° from HerschePs first numbers. Perhaps a still more convincing confirma¬ tion was obtained by Mr Galloway [Phil. Trans. 1847), from the proper motions of stars of the southern he¬ misphere alone, which lead to a result nearly coin¬ ciding with the above",Bradley,US,8,United States,North America
"Yet he was ever impatient until he had brought his conjectures to the test of experiment and observation of the most uncompromising kind. He delighted to give his data a strictly numerical character. Where this was (by their nature) impossible, he confirmed his descriptions by reiterated observation, in different states of weather, with different telescopes, apertures, and magnifying powers ; and with praiseworthy fide¬ lity he enabled his readers to form their own judgment of the character of his results by copious and literal transcripts from his journals. On his claims to originality we are unable in all cases to decide, owing to almost his only literary fault, that of rarely al¬ luding to the writings of his predecessors or con¬ temporaries, even so far as to acknowledge their existence. The discovery of binary systems is pro¬ bably that which was most absolutely his own ; but even supposing the speculations of Wright, Lambert, and Mitchell were not unknown to him, this would diminish but little the substantive merit of having devised and executed the means of removing them from the regions of almost metaphysical abstraction to that of concrete reality","Wright, Mitchell",US,8,United States,North America

"There has been a great improvement in instruments and in the methods of using them. But there has been an incomparably greater advance in the methods of ex¬ tracting trustworthy results from observations made with due care. The art of dividing instruments wTas carried to great perfection in Great Britain by Graham and Bird, but their preference of the quadrant to in¬ struments of a circular form (introduced long before by Romer) retarded the progress of astronomy. Fo¬ reign observatories in the early part of this century (as in the last) sought their divided instruments from London ; Piazzi and Bessel worked with English circles. Troughton was as an artist the worthy suc¬ cessor of Ramsden; and even to the present time British astronomers, at least, do not admit that the nice contrivances and beautiful workmanship of Rep- sold and of Merz in Germany, or of Gambey in France, have produced instruments worthy of more confidence than those which have been constructed at home. In the improvement of object-glasses for telescopes, however, Germany and France bear away the palm, although for many years Dollond supplied Europe with his achromatic telescopes. With regard to constancy and fidelity of observation, whether in fixed observatories or in maritime and geographical expe¬ ditions, English astronomers have never been back¬ ward ; and the reputation of Greenwich Observatory in this respect (and also in the punctuality of pub¬ lication) has, as we have stated elsewhere, earned the approbation and gratitude of all Europe","Graham, London","DE,FR,GB,UK,US",8,"Germany,France,United Kingdom,N/A,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,N/A,North America"

"The proper motions of the stars were also determined for the first time with approximate exactness, by comparing Bradley’s places with more modern ob¬ servations",Bradley,US,8,United States,North America
"Of the subsequent labours of Bessel we must speak ' very shortly. The determination of the parallax of the star called 61 Cygni, perhaps the most original and important of these, we shall refer to another sec¬ tion, where we shall compare it with the results ob¬ tained by other astronomers. He made interesting physical observations on Halley’s comet at its return in 1835; he prepared the materials for a very ex¬ tended catalogue of fixed stars, arranged in zones, more recently published by Professor Weisse. In connection with the theory of the pendulum as a measure of gravity, he repeated and extended Newton’s important experiments on the uniformity of the gra¬ vitating force on all kinds of matter ; he applied a new correction to the vibrations of the pendulum, and improved the method of observing them correctly; and he discussed with his habitual mathematical skill and elaborate perseverance the figure of the Earth, from the whole of the then existing' observations; whilst he also directed an operation for connecting the Russian triangulations with those of western Europe,—a delicate task, which he performed with consummate skill. It will thus be seen that (without mentioning a host of minor works and memoirs) there was hardly a great department of Astronomy in which Bessel did not take a distinguished part.

Jean Charles Borda, who was born in 1733 and ^rove's The was devoted to the promotion of the method of exac^ sciences, and contributed in an eminent degree making to the precision attained in physics and astronomy them. towards the close of the last century. The name of Borda deserves a record in the history of science, since it has been said of him, by no less an authority than Dr Young, that “ he seems to have possessed a considerable share of that natural tact and sagacity which was so remarkable in Newton.” His earlier researches were connected with hydrodynamics, and the resisted motion of projectiles; in later years he was chiefly devoted to practical astronomy and geo¬ desy. The portable repeating circle invented by him has had a very great reputation in France. He was one of the principal designers of the measurement of the French arc, and was employed in its superin¬ tendence, especially as regards the measurement of the base. His experiments on the pendulum were originally undertaken (I believe) in 1790, with a view to making it the basis of the national measures, hut were afterwards subordinated to the greater scheme of terrestrial measurement. Baily records a fact connected with Borda, not unworthy of mention, as a caution to observers :—the year in which many of his experiments were made is not discoverable from the account of them, though the day, hour, minute, and second, are recorded with praiseworthy fidelity",Newton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"But the two individuals who have most studied the practical determination of the length of the se- an/ablo- conds pendulum as a mechanical problem, are Kater lute mea- Laplace 1 Clairaut (besides giving a theorem which, in the case of an ellipsoid, connects the polar compression with the increase of and Mr gravity there) showed that the increase of the force of gravity from the equator will vary as the square of the sine of the lati- Stokes on tude. This he proved to be true when the spheroid is homogeneous, or when it is composed of similar concentric layers of the earth’s varying density. Laplace confirmed the result by a different analysis, and farther showed, that if the earth be composed of con- attraction. centric strata which are severally homogeneous, and nearly spherical, but otherwise arbitrary in form, and if the surface be that of a fluid in equilibrium (as it practically is when we refer the earth’s figure to the sea-level), there exists a necessary connection between gravity and the superficial figure, which, in the case of an ellipsoid of revolution, leads to the same relation of the square of the sine of the latitude. In this case, also, the strata are presumed to be concentric. But in a recent and remarkable paper by Professor Stokes, it is shown that the law connecting the force of gravity and the figure of equilibrium still holds when no hypo¬ thesis whatever is made as to the distribution of the matter within the earth, provided always that it be consistent with the observed fact of the ellipsoidal figure of the earth’s fluid covering. Thus the confirmation, by means of pendulum experiments, of Clairaut’s Theorems cannot be regarded as a proof of the concentric arrangement of the strata, nor (so far) of the primitive fluidity of the earth.

Their memoirs are all considered by competent judges to be excellent, but especially that of Rosenberger, who calculated more fully than the others the perturbations from 1682 to 1759, and who has introduced a theoretical correction of some importance. Some idea of the extent of these calcu¬ lations may be formed from the fact, that in some parts of the orbit the Elements were made to vary for intervals of only two days. The Comet of Halley was rediscovered at Rome on the 6th August 1835, in the Jesuits’ College. The error of Rosenber- ger’s Ephemeris was only seven minutes of arc, and the perihelion passage took place on the 16th No¬ vember (civil reckoning), five days after the predicted time.

La¬ place gave a method for an elliptic orbit, which may represent any number of observations. Gauss, in his Theoria Motus Corporum Celestium, treated the subject with great skill and generality. I am unable to state who first attempted to discriminate an ellip¬ tic from a parabolic cometary orbit, or to determine the period in the former from observations at one ap¬ parition only. It is evident that such outstanding differences as are irreconcilable with a parabolic orbit, will be most perceptible in the case of comets whose orbits have a tolerably short major axis, or whose period is not very great, and will be mate¬ rially increased by watching a comet through a con¬ siderable part of its orbit, which the assiduous appli¬ cation of telescopes to every part of the heavens has of late years rendered much more frequent than for¬ merly. Amongst others, Bessel, who has signalized himself by a capital performance in this, as in every other department of Astronomy, applied rigorous me¬ thods to determine the orbits of the comets of 1807 and 1815 ; the latter of which will very probably return to its perihelion in 1887. It is undeniable, however, that expert calculators have often been deceived in assigning orbits, even when believed to be of short period, founded upon a single apparition",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

He investigated with great labour the effects of the planet¬ ary perturbations on this body, which, in the case of Jupiter, are occasionally very large, if that planet be in the part of its orbit near the aphelion position of the comet, when it approaches the orbit of Jupiter","Jupiter, Jupiter",US,8,United States,North America
"In order satisfactorily to arrive at any such con- (271.) elusion, it was of course necessary to estimate with great accuracy the perturbing effects of the planets Encke’s on the Comet’s motion; and it is not a little curious comet ap- and satisfactory, that the movements of this insigni- PIied to ficant erratic body should have occasioned a mate- masses of6 rial rectification of the masses of two of the Planets.

"more nearly to the orbit of Mercury than the aphelion does to that of Jupiter; consequently at times the perturbations due to the former planet may be very great, and though the gravitating mass of the Comet is utterly unknown, yet since the momentary direc¬ tion of its motion depends solely on the ratio of the attractive force of the Sun and Mercury, its observed course gives the means of estimating that ratio.1 (272.) The theory of a resisting medium was, on the whole, Theory of well received, especially in England, where some of a resisting our first authorities gave it their adhesion. The then altogether1 recent establishment of the Undulatory Theory of favourably Light, was thought by many to receive a confirmation received, from this evidence of something material filling the planetary spaces. In Germany the hypothesis of re¬ sistance received the complete opposition of Bessel’s high authority ; who declared that “ a hundred other reasons” might be found for the fact of the accelera¬ tion, which he admits to be true. Encke, in reply, reduces these 100 possible hypotheses to four, of which we shall mention only one, as seemingly important, namely, the forces exerted with so much intensity within the body of the Comet itself, as indicated by the projection of the tail. But he observes, with great sagacity, that these forces, being apparently usually excited in the line of the radius-vector joining the Comet and the Sun, can hardly be supposed to affect the periodic time. It having also been objected that Halley’s Comet shows no trace of acceleration, but, if anything, of the reverse, M. Encke truly says, that its perihelion distance does not lie within the assumed limits of the denser ether",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"Gambart’s most remarkable discovery was the pe- (277.) riodicity of the first Comet of 1826, having detected Periodicity that body independently at Marseilles, though it hadin Gf yeais> been observed some days previously in Bohemia, by Biela, an officer in the Austrian service. It is most usually called Biela’s Comet, though it might with equal right be termed Gambart’s, who assigned its path and predicted its return. Clausen, about the same time with Gambart, assigned it a period of about 7 years ; and it was identified with former appear¬ ances in 1772 and 1805-6. Its period thus appeared to be 2460 days, or 6f years ; its aphelion is a little exterior to Jupiter’s orbit, and its perihelion is not much within the Earth’s. This Comet’s orbit very nearly intersects in one place the orbit of the Earth, so that had the earth been one month forwarder in its annual course in 1832, a collision would have taken place, or at least the Earth would have been enveloped in a cometary haze; for it is difficult to imagine a collision Avith a body whose tenuity is so excessive, that Sir John Herschel perceived through its entire thickness (estimated at 50,000 miles) stars of the most excessive minuteness (16th or 17th mag¬ nitude) as seen by his 20-feet reflector. It is an in¬ teresting circumstance, that the first predicted peri¬ helion passage, in 1832, took place within some hours of the time fixed by MM.

"by all, his career at Cambridge reflected upon it fresh lustre ; the variety and extent of his acquirements gave him a reputation amongst his college contem¬ poraries, afterwards fully confirmed by the not more impartial voice of mankind at large.” He was senior wrangler in 1813. “ Since that time he has been indefatigable as an author:—first, in systematizing the higher mathematics, and in forwarding their study in his own university ;—afterwards by treatises con¬ tributed to the Encyclopcedia Metropolitana on Sound, Light, and Physical Astronomy, which still rank among the clearest, completest, and most philoso¬ phical in our language. About the same time he wrote experimental essays on different branches of Chemistry, Magnetism, and Optics, and commenced his purely astronomical investigations, chiefly on nebulae and double stars, partly in conjunction with Sir James South, of which the details are given in different volumes of the Astronomical, and of the Royal Society’s Transactions.

The career of Sir John Herschel has been marked by an almost total absence of the ele¬ ment of ambition, so often a powerful excitement in the pursuit of discovery. Had he sought notoriety and posthumous fame, he would have confined his efforts within a more circumscribed range. But his versatile talents sought their appropriate exercise in all departments of exact science, and even (it is be¬ lieved) in pursuits widely distinct from these, in natural history, belles lettres, and the fine arts. In all this he no doubt considered simply the useful and pleasurable employment of his mental activi¬ ties. Truth seemed to him as desirable whether at¬ tained by the labours of others or by his own; and in his numerous writings he has expounded these with a zest which a less generous spirit might have reserved for his peculiar achievements. What he may have lost in future fame by this enlargement of his sympathies and interests, he has gained in the re¬ spect and good-will of all his contemporaries. Sir John Herschel recently filled the post of Master of the Mint, to which, like his illustrious predecessor Newton, he devoted a considerable share of his time",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

To Savary of Paris is due the merit of ascertaining the form and position of the orbit of £ Ursse Majoris in 1827, which was followed by a more purely analytical method by M. Encke, and one chiefly graphical by Sir J. Herschel,2 in which angles of position of the component stars are used nearly to the exclusion of the more doubtful measures of distance. On the whole, these investigations not onlyconfirm Sir William Herschel’s anticipations, but render it highly probable that the relative orbits are really ellipses, and consequently that the law of force is that of the inverse square of the distance. The reader will find in Sir J. Herschel’s Cape Observa¬ tions a very curious discussion of the orbit of y Vir- ginis, a remarkable double star, whose interval was in 1783 five seconds and two-thirds, which diminished till 1836, when the two stars appeared united in one, as seen even in the best telescopes. This was the perihelion passage of these two suns, and the angle of position must then have varied (could it have been measured) at the rate of 70° per annum, or 1° in 5 days.

The result, which gave to this star an annual parallax of 0-91 of a second, is believed to be correct, because it has been confirmed by Mr Maclear, Henderson’s successor at the Cape. It may, however, be not unreasonable to desire that the observations should be repeated in another locality, and with a different instrument; for it has not been unusual (as in the case of Brinkley) to obtain under the same circumstances perfectly consistent, yet erroneous, and therefore inexplicable results",Henderson,US,8,United States,North America

The details of this elaborate in¬ vestigation have been considered by competent judges as among the happiest specimens of astronomical in¬ duction ; and like Professor Henderson’s, they have also had the advantage of subsequent and still more independent corroboration. Professor Johnson of Oxford, using, like Bessel, a divided object-glass micrometer (or heliometer, as it is not very appro¬ priately called, never being applied to the sun), has obtained results for the parallax of a Cygni almost identical with Bessel’s, which was O’35 of a second",Oxford,US,8,United States,North America
"I have attempted, in the first chapter of this Dis¬ sertation, to place the scientific part of engineering in its due relation to pure physics, and I have compared the relation between them to that subsisting between Mathematics and Physics—the one as an instrument, the other as an end. Now it was this, in particular, which made Watt the important character he really was. He brought out the dependence of the former sub¬ jects, as Newton and others had successfully taught and demonstrated that of the latter",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"“ semi-omnipotent engines,” perpetual motions, “ quintessences of motion,” and the like, mingled with trivial mechanical toys ; or we have elaborate diagrams of mill-gearing, lathes, fountains, and saw¬ ing machines without end, illustrated with showy and expensive plates, but destitute, for the most part, of the slightest novelty of principle, or truly mechani¬ cal skill in application. Here and there, no doubt, elegant and appropriate contrivances for communi¬ cating or sustaining motion occur; but nearly all the best forms of elementary machinery were of re¬ mote antiquity, excepting those connected with clock¬ work, which, including the great and truly scientific application of the principle of Isochronism, formed the only considerable step in philosophical mechanics for very many years previous to the conception of the steam-engine. The statical part of mechanics had made more progress. Masonry and Carpentry had attained a degree of perfection in many respects admirable, under the Italian and Norman architects ; but the really difficult theory of machinery in motion was little understood before Watt’s day, and the knowledge which then existed was unassociated with practical skill or commercial enterprize. It could be found only in profound treatises of theoretical mechanics, and in experimental courses of natural philosophy. The sources of power were almost ex¬ clusively those derived from simple gravity and the impact of fluids. It was not, indeed, the good for¬ tune of Watt to be the first to employ the admirable 5 R (311.) . Petera",Norman,"US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"Such combinations of theory and practice have now become far from rare. They have followed the march of physical learning, they have borrowed from it, and they have contributed to it. But it was Watt who chiefly gave the happy example. Himself by education and habit strictly a mechanic, he had the peculiar merit of apprehending the value of theory, and of acquiring a kind of knowledge then altogether uncommon amongst persons of his profession. He was no doubt a successful speculator, and a shrewd ingenious man besides; and this, his ostensible cha¬ racter, constituted possibly in the eyes of many his world-wide celebrity. But such considerations were little likely to influence the opinions of contemporary scientific men well qualified to judge, and least of all of eminent foreigners, who generallyregard with little partiality the presumed commercial character of their insular neighbours. Dr Black, who was by no means prodigal of praise, termed the steam-engine, as im¬ proved by Watt, “ an invention which is in its pre¬ sent state the master-piece of human skill,” not “ the production of a chance observation, but the result of deep thought and reflection, and really a present by philosophy to the arts.’’1 Professor Bo- bison, who knewr Mr Watt intimately, was even more enthusiastic in his appreciation of his genius; and Sir Humphry Davy, in a speech manifesting a just estimate of his peculiar merits, did not hesitate to place him on a level with Archimedes.2 But a tes¬ timony more authoritative and unbiassed than any of these, is the fact that Watt was elected first a corresponding member of the French Institute, and finally one of the eight foreign Associates of the Aca¬ demy of Sciences. This honour, to which so few can attain, which Newton once owned, and which now7 graces or lately graced the names of Y^oung, Hum¬ boldt, Oersted, Brewster, and Robert Brown, is a sure passport to scientific immortality. Here, at least, no utilitarian pride, nor even the laudably pa¬ triotic emotion of gratitude to one w7ho had proved, in more w ays than one, his country’s benefactor, can be supposed to have influenced in the remotest de¬ gree his election",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Other methods of producing direct rotation oc- (323.) curred to the ingenious mind of Watt, and many of Expansive them were shown to be practicable by being actually workmS- executed in model size. But the next great practi¬ cal improvement introduced by him was the princi- ciple of expansive working, whereby a saving of steam is produced (particularly in single-acting engines), second in importance only to the result of the sepa¬ rate condensation. This consists in allowing the steam to flow in upon the piston during only the first part of the stroke ; the rest being completed partly 1 This happy idea seems to have been suggested by Dr Small of Birmingham in a letter to Watt, of date 5th November 1769",Birmingham,US,8,United States,North America
"(324.) In the Cornish engine we see the Energy of Heat Their per- ren(jereq available to an extent which the inventor fection. .. , himselt would at one time have thought scarcely cre¬ dible. The combustion of a bushel of coal which in a Newcomen’s engine improved by Smeaton was capable of raising 3,000,000 pounds through one foot, in Watt’s improved pumping engine raised 20,000,000 pounds the same height. But by the indefatigable skill and perseverance of engineers the Cornish pumps now yield at least five times the last amount. This, however, is not the place to enter upon these details, nor can we stop to particularize the other and various mechanical inventions intro¬ duced by Watt in the form of valves, governors, and steam-indicators. Still less can we enlarge upon the endless and still multiplying applications of this ad¬ mirable moving power, which is as capable of super¬ seding the greatest natural forces hitherto applied by man to the useful arts, as it is adapted by its easy regulation to replace human industry in the most delicate operations; “ the trunk of an elephant, which can pick up a pin or rend an oak, is as nothing to it.”2 Of the applications of the steam-engine with which (325.) Mr Watt was less immediately connected, its adap- tation to locomotion in the case of ships in the last steam to century, and in that of railway trains in the present, navigation, have been the most striking, and fraught with con¬ sequences the most important to mankind. Of the latter we shall have occasion to speak in a future section ; of the origin of steam navigation we may here say a very few words. Passing over projects which never were realized, of moving barges by steam, or other inanimate power, against wind and tide,— such as those of Worcester, Papin, and Hulls,—wre find that the first experiment entitled to be called successful was made by Mr Miller of Dalswinton in Miller— Scotland, conjointly -with Mr James Taylor, tutor in Taylor- his family, who together formed the project of mov¬ ing vessels by means of paddle-wheels driven by a steam-engine, and realized it with the aid of Sym¬ ington, a practical engineer. As we shall also find in the case of steam-carriages, the idea of the applica¬ tion of the steam-engine to move ships was already a familiar one to the minds of many persons about the middle of the last century. To put it in practice with advantage was the step required. Mr Miller’s first boat was launched on Dalswinton Loch in Dum¬ friesshire, in October 1788, and attained a speed of five miles an hour. The subject was pursued by Symington and others. In 1789 a larger vessel was propelled on the Forth and Clyde Canal. Subse¬ quently, however, the invention languished. The want of co-operation, of capital, and ingenuity, na¬ turally extinguishes many valuable inventions. Watt himself was only rescued from the same difficulty by the unusual intelligence of Boulton and Small, his coadjutors at Birmingham. Symington was less for¬ tunate, as well as probably less meritorious ; and though it is well established that Fulton, who passes on the other side of the Atlantic for the inventor of steam-ships, had seen the relics of Symington’s second experiment, we must do the Americans the justice to say that the application of steam to navigation first flourished in the United States. In 1807 Fulton Fulton, started a river boat with an engine of Boulton and Watt. In 1813 the example was tardily imitated on the Firth of Clyde. The subsequent improvements need not here be specified. They have been very great and striking, but with the exception of the recent substitution of the screw-propeller for paddle-wheels, they scarcely involve any new principles.3 We may briefly close what we have to say of Mr (326.) Watt personally. His health was feeble from child- ^ar°eter hood, but being blessed with much calmness of tern- 0f Watt, per he prolonged his life to a great age, and passed through its struggles, though they were to him con- 1 The double-acting engine was planned in 1774 or 1775.

"Thomas Telford, though neither the contriver of (351.) suspension bridges, nor the introducer of them into Telford; Britain,3 deserves notice from the superior boldness ^idges10n and solidity of the noblest work of the kind which has yet been executed—the Menai Bridge. Telford (and the same may be said of his contemporary Rennie) was more distinguished as a man of judg¬ ment, integrity, and experience, than as eminently original or philosophical. In this respect both yield to Smeaton, who, with Watt, was the founder (each in his own department) of modern engineering. But the beautiful and truly workmanlike structure of the Menai Bridge inaugurated the era of the extensive introduction of that admirable material, wrought iron, into great permanent structures exposed to heavy strains. Cast iron had been used much ear¬ lier, as in the bridge erected at Colebrookdale in 1777 by Mr Derby, and in the very beautiful arch at Sunderland, which dates from 1796. The span of the Menai Bridge is 580 feet, the whole quantity of iron used was 2186 tons, the transverse section of the suspending chains or bars was 260 square inches, supporting a strain of 1094^ tons.

"(352) Telford never made extensive experiments on the Ziata of re-resistance of solids.

A few years after leaving college he originated the plan of a machine for calculating tables by means of successive orders of differences, and having received for it in 1822 and the following year the support of the Astronomical and Royal Societies, and a grant of money from go¬ vernment, he proceeded to its execution. It is be¬ lieved that Mr Babbage was the first who thought of employing mechanism for computing tables by means of differences ; the machine was subsequently termed the difference engine. In the course of his proceedings Mr Babbage invented a mechanical no¬ tation (described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826), intended to showr the exact mutual rela¬ tions of all the parts of any connected machine, how¬ ever complex, at a given instant of time. He also made himself acquainted with the various machines used in the arts, with the tools used in constructing them, and with the details of the most improved workshops.

"George Stephenson, civil engineer, was born in 1780 near Newcastle, of respectable persons in the humblest rank of life. His father was either a com¬ mon pitman or otherwise employed about the collier¬ ies of the district, and young Stephenson, without any advantages of education, began to labour for his bread at an early age. His work appears to have been always connected with the machinery of the pits above ground, and not with their excavation. Thus he rose gradually to be an engine-man at the wages of twelve shillings a week. This was at Killingworth near Newcastle, where he showed considerable me¬ chanical ingenuity, and gradually gained the confi¬ dence of his employers. Having married in 1802, he had a son born the following year, the present Mr Robert Stephenson, M.P., whom he brought up with the tenderest care, and whom he ever and justly regarded with a father’s pride. In order to bestow upon him the advantage of that education of which he had himself felt the want, it is stated that he made money at extra hours by mending his neighbours’ clocks and watches, and finally, in more prosperous days, sent his son to complete his education at the University of Edinburgh. George Stephenson never acquired much book-learning himself, but by natural sagacity and observation he attained to a sound knowledge of mechanical principles. We do not claim for him, however, the character of great inven¬ tiveness. His skill rather lay in perceiving how far methods and contrivances already known might be pushed to an advantageous result. He possessed that shrewd decision which ingenious persons often want, enabling him to detect what is truly valuable in the numerous mechanical schemes which at any time are afloat, and to devise the means of realizing them.

Newton here, as in other de¬ partments, overstepping the limits of knowledge of his day, left a legacy of toil to his immediate suc¬ cessors. Lagrange had the most distinguished good fortune in reducing the theory of aerial tremors under their most general conditions to the laws of mecha¬ nics by the calculus of partial differentials ; and La¬ place supplied the link which was wanting to recon¬ cile the result with the known mechanical properties of air. As the former of these matters belongs more properly to the period of the previous Dissertation, Laplace’s and as the beautiful discovery of Laplace has been ofUie^011 nJOre esPecially touched upon by Sir John Leslie, theory. ^ wiU he sufficient here to recall the fact that the spring of air, or the effort by which it tends to re¬ expand under sudden compression or to contract to its former bulk when suddenly dilated, is increased by the heat extricated in the former case, as well as by its absorption in the latter. And as sonorous pulsations are held to consist of a series of com¬ pressed and rarified waves whose velocity is affected by the recoil of air, it appears certain that the velo¬ city must be increased by this circumstance, though it is difficult to determine experimentally the exact amount","Newton, Laplace, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"We shall say a few words under each of these heads :— (435.) I. Chladni observed the velocity of sound in air sound1 in °f different densities, and in different gases, by using different a flute °f metal which was sounded by means of the media; elastic fluid required, and the resulting note enabled him to determine by an easy calculation the speed of propagation of the tremor. This method (using an organ pipe) has been more lately resorted to by Dulong for the purpose of deducing the properties of different gases with respect to heat, by ascertain¬ ing from experiment the co-efficient in Laplace’s correction for the velocity of sound. Chladni was also probably the first to notice the longitudinal os¬ cillations of strings and rods which always yield a note immensely sharper than the lateral vibrations",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America

"The history of Optics in the eighteenth century is one of the blankest pages of scientific story; at least if we allow Bradley’s discovery of aberration to be (as it really is) rather an astronomical than an optical discovery. The most notable advance was unques¬ tionably the invention of the achromatic telescope as narrated in the Fifth Dissertation,2 founded on the proof of Newton’s oversight in the matter of dis¬ persion. The construction of refracting telescopes made rapid advancement in the workshop of Dollond, whilst reflecting telescopes, in the hands first of Short, but far more conspicuously, of Sir William Herschel, were shown to be capable of making unimagined dis¬ coveries. The geometrical theory of optical instru¬ ments was also greatly improved; but all this led to little increased knowledge concerning Light itself","Bradley, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"If we except the valuable though imperfect treatises of Bouguer and Lambert on the subject of photo¬ metry, and a paper by Mr (now Lord) Brougham in the last years of the century, recalling attention to the inflexion of light, the history of Physical Optics (as that part of the science touching more imme¬ diately the nature and qualities of light is now usu¬ ally termed) is almost a blank from the publication of the Optics of Newton in 1704 to that of Young’s papers almost one hundred years later","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

"(which would have been his natural destination^, and entered the university of Edinburgh as a medical stu¬ dent at the age of twenty-one. He had already de¬ clined the overtures of such distinguished patrons as Windham and Burke, resolving to devote himself to the pursuit of science, for which a medical education seemed to him a fit entrancehis studies being made under the more immediate advice of his uncle, Dr Broeklesby. He attended Black’s lectures in Edin¬ burgh ; whether he was known to Robison I am not aware, though I should be inclined to infer that he was from the terms in which Robison speaks of Young when criticising his strictures upon Smith’s Harmonics. Robison disagreed with him on this point, and also about the nature of light, yet he speaks of Young and of his paper on Sound with very marked respect. More than a year before his enrolment at Edinburgh (which took place in autumn 1794), he communicated to the Royal Society of London a paper on vision, of which we shall pre¬ sently give some further account; and was elected a fellow of the Society when just of age","Edinburgh, Windham, Burke, Young, Young, Edinburgh, London","GB,US,UY",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay","Europe,North America,South America"
"From Edinburgh he proceeded to Gottingen where he graduated ; acquiring the German language, and leaving a vivid impression of his astonishing versa¬ tility of tqlent and powers of memory. Early in 1797 he returned to England, and soon after en¬ tered himself at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in order to comply with the requisitions of the London College of Physicians, and thus to obtain a license to practice. For the next few years his time was divided much between Cambridge and London. He was now twenty-three years of age, and his mental habits too much formed to bend to the rules of Cam¬ bridge study. When the master of his college intro¬ duced him to the fellows, he is reported to have said, “ I have brought you a pupil qualified to read lec¬ tures to his tutors,” and such, no doubt, was the fact","Cambridge, London, Cambridge, London","US,GB,DE",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Germany","North America,Europe,Europe"
"We hear little of his occupations at Cambridge, but we can hardly doubt that his private studies then ranged over the vast fields of erudition which he af¬ terwards proved that he had made so completely his own ; and we cannot doubt that he was then preparing the groundwork of his theory of optics, although his discovery of interference was certainly not made at Cambridge, and probably in London after his settle¬ ment there in 1800.1 His first paper on sound and light is dated from Cambridge in July 1799","Cambridge, Cambridge, London, Cambridge","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"I have entered into these details because they throw light on the peculiarities of Young’s cha¬ racter and attainments. He was to a great degree self-educated ; and his studies in consequence may be called desultory, though none would dare to call them superficial. Mathematicians may consider his acquaintance with their science as not technically complete, yet one of them admits that “ he could make a small amount of mathematics go farther than any one else.” Had he been a consummate analyst it is unlikely that we should have had in him the author of the undulatory theory, the difficulties of which in its earlier stages made it unpalatable to Laplace, Poisson, and the most considerable French mathematicians. Having thought out for himself every one of the multifarious subjects with which he grappled, his writings have a striking force and ori¬ ginality, and his reports of the labours of others are almost invariably drawn from a study of their original works. His earliest principle was, that what one man has done another may accomplish; and one of the many respects in which he resembled his great predecessor Newton, was unbounded confidence in the powers of “ patient thought.” Not that he con¬ fined the desire to excel to purely intellectual matters","Young, Laplace, Newton","US,UY,FR",8,"United States,Uruguay,France","North America,South America,Europe"
"Embracing the arts as well as the whole of natural philosophy, it seems to include the mention of every¬ thing connected with his vast subject from the simplest tool of the artisan to the highest specu¬ lations of Newton and Lagrange; and yet it is evi¬ dent, by the masterly manner in which he handles it, that the author had made all this mass of know¬ ledge completely his own. The catalogue of refer¬ ences with which it closes indicates an extent of bib¬ liographical research which would have done honour to any one who had made that an exclusive object of study. Even the plates are drawn with a studious care, betokening well his own mechanical talent",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Hooke’s idea that yellow, or any other colour, was the result of the conflict of pulses simultaneously reaching the eye, was an assertion, admissible, per¬ haps, at that time, as expressing a fact; but surely not a proof of interference producing reinforcement or annihilation of light, as taught by Young. I am not aware that Hooke ever even reiterated his opinions on this subject after Newton had analysed the phe¬ nomena experimentally, and shown that the colours of thin plates result from the superposition of bright and dark rings of different prismatic hues, each with its appropriate diameter. It was then apparent that colour was only an indirect effect of interference","Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"The uniformity of its propagation through the celes¬ tial spaces, its rectilinear course in ordinary circum¬ stances, the laws of its reflection and refraction, are there explained with a degree of elegance and preci¬ sion which ought to have excited (we must think) general attention and assent, but for the ascendancy of Newton’s authority, and the astonishing and beau¬ tiful nature of the experiments on which his theories were based; whereas Huygens referred to few expe¬ riments except those of the simplest kind, and the phenomena of colour were (for good reasons) left chiefly out of view.2 Such being the case, Huygens may fairly be considered as the author of the undu¬ latory theory, which he supported by such convincing proofs",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"To this he added the assumption, that in refracting media, such as glass, the pulsations are retarded ; whereas in Newton’s theory, as is well known, the propagation of light is assumed to be fastest in dense media. The “law of the sines” in refraction, is de¬ duced as a consequence ; and one of the prettiest ap¬ plications made of it is to the phenomena of atmo¬ spherical refraction. But the most important features of the whole investigation are these two—(1), the 1 The reference of Arago, in his original eloge of Young, is to p. 387 of the Lectures, obviously by mistake.

It would be beside .of light. our present object to discuss Newton’s opinions; but it is too certain that he did not allow Huygens’ argu¬ ments on the undulatory nature of light to have any weight with him. Not that he was averse (as is often supposed) to the presence of Ether as modify¬ ing the corpuscular theory of light; on the con¬ trary, in many of his minor writings he speaks of its existence as all but certain, and as a requisite adjunct to the corpuscular hypothesis to which he had been led by the facts of reflection and refrac¬ tion.1 But he never adjusted the terms of a compro¬ mise, and must be held, we think, to have left behind him no substantive theory of light worthy of the name. The question never perhaps very seriously engaged his attention after the publication of Huy¬ gens’ book ;2 and we know that about that time his intellectual energies received a shock which left him indisposed for the fatigue of constructing new theories, and still more disinclined to publish them","Newton, Newton, Huy","US,BE",8,"United States,Belgium","North America,Europe"
"They are eminently marked by penetration, profound induction, and candour of argument. Starting from his studies in acoustics, the transition to optical questions is extremely gradual. Young was, cha¬ racteristically, a good musician in practice, as well as a profound one in theory, and his paper of 1799 is principally acoustical. In it he attaches conse¬ quence to showing that the divergence of sound from the direction of its emission is slower and less com¬ plete than it is commonly believed to be, and he applies the analogy to the existence of rays of light and definite shadows. In one short section he sums up the chief points of optical doctrine which lead him to prefer the theory of Huygens to that of Newton. Amongst the facts better explained by waves than corpus¬ cles, we find reckoned Inflection and the Colours of thin plates. But all this is stated in a very general way, evidently rather as a conclusion towards which his mind had for some time been tending, than as the result of demonstrative proofs. In his paper of 1801 the undulatory doctrine is methodically expounded in a series of propositions, accompanied by proofs. The accurate definition of shadows is shown to be possible and natural on that theory, as well as the usual phe¬ nomena of reflection, refraction, and total reflection","Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"1 Thus Newton writes in 1675 :—“ Were I to assume an hypothesis, it should be this, if propounded more generally, so as not to determine what light is farther than that it is something or other capable of exciting vibrations in the ether ; for thus it will become so general and comprehensive of other hypotheses as to leave little room for new ones to be invented.” And again, “ Do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations [of the retina], the least refrangible the largest ? ”—Birch’s Hist, of the Royal Society, quoted in Young’s Lectures, ii. 615, 617. Sir D. Brewster (Life of Newton, 1855, vol. i. p. 148) considers that some passages in the later editions of Newton’s OpJtcs show that he had departed from any theory of undulations","Young, Newton, Newton","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"The partial reflection which always accompanies re¬ fraction is strongly and justly insisted on as an ob¬ vious consequence of the theory, while it requires a sepai'ate hypothesis on Newton’s. But the chief weight is claimed for the evidence from the colours of heated surfaces, of thin plates, and of diffracted shadows, all of which the author explains by the mixture of two portions of light conveying to the same particle of ether at the same time either ac¬ cordant or opposing motions, thus redoubling or destroying the light. Of these the splendid iri¬ descent colours reflected by surfaces having fine equidistant lines drawn upon them, admit of the most elementary and striking explanation. The reflected image of a luminous point viewed in a mirror thus cut up by parallel lines, consists of one common reflection and numerous lateral images which are coloured, and in which the angles of inci¬ dence and reflection are not equal, thus contradicting one of the axioms of common optics. Young showed that the scattered waves of light recover the faculty of appearing when the surface of the plate is seen under such an angle that foreshortened intervals between the scratches amount severally to the length of one undulation or a multiple of it; for then the waves of light scattered by the reflecting surface will not come entire to the eye, but each will have a part systema¬ tically suppressed by the non-reflecting space of the groove, so that the remainders being nearly in one phase, concur in making a general impression. This experiment, therefore, literally presents us with the paradox that by suppressing half the light, the re¬ mainder is not suffered to be extinguished by it. The different colours appear reflected at different angles, because the obliquity must vary in order to be ac¬ commodated to their several wave-lengths, and each colour undergoes several repetitions corresponding to breadths representing the successive multiples of a wave-length","Newton, Of, Young","US,TR,UY",8,"United States,Turkey,Uruguay","North America,Asia,South America"
"A slip of card one-thirtieth of an inch wide being held in the sunbeam, its shadow was observed on the opposite wall or on a moveable screen. There were seen fringes of colour exterior to the shadow on each side, such as Newton had described, and on which Mr Brougham and others had made experi¬ ments. But besides these, the narrower and less conspicuous fringes seen in the interior of the shadow, and first described by Grimaldi, were found by Young to have this remarkable property, that they disap¬ peared the moment that the light passing either edge of the card was intercepted, whilst the exterior fringe was not at all affected by that circumstance excepting on the side where the light was stopped","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"the wave round the opaque edge ; but the alternation of light and dark spaces required the union of the two lights from opposite edges, which, immediately behind the centre of the obstacle, must have de¬ scribed exactly equal paths, and therefore united in the same phase; but a little way either to the right or left of the centre the phases were discordant, and complete and effectual annihilation of the light re¬ sulted. In fact, when the experiment is performed under favourable circumstances, the result of the union of the light is perfect blackness in these places, but if half the light is stopped the dark spaces be¬ come luminous ! This splendid paradox may also be demonstrated (402.) without any bending round the edges of bodies, and Mixed consequently without any inflexion in Newton’s sense of the word ; and this simplifies the conditions mate- bands, rially. In order to effect this, Fresnel (many years after) produced interference bands by allowing light emitted from a very small luminous point (an image of the sun formed by a lens of short focus) to fall upon two mirrors touching at the edge, and inclined to one another at an angle very little less than 180°",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"(463.) It ^ an easy matter (comparatively) to assign the Length of lengths of a wave of light, from the intervals of the the waves interference lines, or still better from the elongations of coloured ^ ^ coloure(j images produced by striated surfaces, lg ' the intervals of the striae being given. Newton’s measures of the intervals between the lenses pro¬ ducing coloured rays, gave Dr Young the following for the number of undulations contained in an inch producing each colour: Extreme Red  37,640 Boundary Red and Orange  40,720 ... Orange and Yellow  42,510 ... Yellow and Green  45,600 ... Green and Blue  49,320 ... Blue and Indigo  52,910 Indigo and Violet  55,240 Extreme Violet  59,750 Now the velocity of light is known, that is, the rate of propagation of a disturbance in ether; but the duration of an impulse, or rather the interval between two successive impulses striking the eye and pro¬ ducing the effect of colour, is the time that an impulse Number of takes to travel over the length of a wave. It is easy vibrations to see how almost infinitely short this must be : 460 in a second. mfffions of millions of such impressions in a second of time go to make up the sensation of redness, 735 millions of millions that of violet light","Newton, Orange, Orange, Green, Green",US,8,United States,North America

The general fact of the ar¬ rangement of colour in the primary and secondary bows Newton accounted for. But the spurious or Spurious supernumerary bows occasionally seen within the bows‘ primary, and far more rarely beyond the secondary, consisting of reddish and greenish bands, remained unexplained. The brilliancy of any given portion of the rainbow depends upon the deviation of the sun’s rays by two refractions and one reflection, approach¬ ing to a limit which it cannot overpass. But except at this precise limit an amount of scattered light will reach the eye, which, though not reflected under the most favourable circumstances, yet is still sufficiently intense to be visible. This light must be composed, as Young showed, of two portions, entering the eye in the same direction, but which have pursued different paths within the drop, and which never coincide except at the extreme geometrical limit before mentioned","Newton, Young, Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

Even a partial in¬ sight into its cause confers a certain reputation upon one individual (De Dominis), its farther explication gave Newton one of his most popular triumphs. It is then found that the rainbow is not so simple a fact as was supposed, and that Newton’s theory accounts for only its broader features. Then, as in the theory of gravity, a long period of uncertainty ensues ; hut observations are continued. A perfect rainbow is found to be one of the rarest of natural phenomena, instead of the commonest. Not above two or three individuals have ever seen, or at least described one","Newton, Newton",US,8,United States,North America
"Then comes Dr Young, with his theory of interfe¬ rence and diffraction. This theory not only accounts for the spurious bows, but for the precise appearance of the principal ones, which, but for it, would have been different from what Newton supposed. Finally, after being canvassed for more than two centuries, the theory of Young is carried out into its rigorous consequences by Mr Airy1 and Professor Stokes2 (who must first invent a new mathematical method for the purpose) and illustrated by the ingenious ex¬ periments of M. Babinet and Professor Miller ;3 until at last we begin to believe that we understand this matter completely","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

I have done so because Young’s ex¬ planation wTas imperfect, not to say incorrect. But as it would be inconvenient to discuss the subject here, I shall briefly indicate its history and result. Dr Young expresses himself more obscurely in his paper of 1801 on this point than on any other, indicating three possible explanations. In 1803, however, he distinctly adopts the opinion that the periodical colours in question are due to the interference of direct light passing near the opaque edge with a por¬ tion of light very obliquely reflected from that edge; and he enters into calculations to show that such a theory represents sufficiently well Newton’s measures","Young, Newton, Young, Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"

His researches (pre¬ ceding and anticipating those of Laplace) on capillary attraction have also been referred to (432), as well as his masterly investigation of the tides (80, 81).

The successes of Champollion, Rawlinson, and others, in similar undertakings, must logically be connected with the first great step of de¬ cyphering the polyglot stone of Rosetta. It may safely be affirmed that no philologer ever before made such a discovery in science as the law of interference, and that no natural philosopher ever made such a step in the interpretation of a lost tongue as the forma¬ tion (up to a certain point) of an Egyptian alphabet","Laplace, Rosetta","EG,US",8,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

His office as secretary to the Board of Longitude (the only public promotion he received), was attended not only with immense labour in editing the Nautical Al¬ manac, but with vexatious contentions, which in his, as in so many other cases, tended to diminish his usefulness and even shorten his life. To the petty persecutions with which he was assailed, it was owing that the health which the unbroken study of fifty years had not impaired, at length gave way, and he and death, died yet in the prime of intellect, the 10th May 1829, within a few months of his honoured asso¬ ciates and friends, Wollaston and Davy.

"Dr Young’s philosophical character approached in (473.) many important particulars to that of Newton. With Philosophi- much of the inventive fire of Davy, and of the rea- CharaC soiling sagacity of Wollaston, he combined an amount of acquired learning, and a versatility in its applica¬ tion, far superior to both. We do not ascribe to him an intuitive insight so rapid and almost divine as that which distinguished the author of the Principia above all other men, nor had Young the same strictly mathematical ability; but like Newton, whatever he did was practical and sound ; nothing was done for show, nothing omitted through haste. “ The power of patient thought” was the lever with which he moved the world. His self-confidence was great but unobtrusive. He attained, as he himself said, all the main objects to which he had looked forward in life, “ such fame as he valued, and such acquirements as he might think to deserve it.” (474.)

"Etienne Louis Malus was born at Paris on the 23d July 1775, and died on the 24th February 1812, after a too brief but brilliant career. His principal discovery, that of the polarization of light by reflec¬ tion, is so intimately connected, both histoiically and by the nature of the case, with double refraction, that I shall briefly sum up the scanty progress of that singular subject previous to his time",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"It was known to Bartholin of Copenhagen, about 1669, that Iceland or calcareous-spar has the pro¬ perty of dividing a ray of light, which falls upon it in almost any direction, into two; one of which is refracted according to the usual law, but the other in an extraordinary manner, which was first analyzed by Huygens—a problem of great difficulty, in which Newton not only failed, but he also erred in con¬ tinuing to pronounce Huygens’ solution false. The solution was this, that there is one direction in the crystal parallel to which both the rays (called the ordinary and the extraordinary') move in a similar and uniform manner. In other directions their pro¬ pagation may be expressed by considering the ordi¬ nary ray within the crystal to be due to a spherical wave (the centre of which coincides with the point of incidence), whilst the extraordinary ray corre¬ sponds to a flattened spheroidal wave concentric with the former, and having its axis coincident with a diameter of the sphere, and parallel to the minera- logical axis of the crystal. Both rays, on the Huy- genian hypothesis, move slower than in air, but the extraordinary ray everywhere faster than the ordi¬ nary ray, excepting only in the axial direction. A perfectly plain though necessarily complex construc¬ tion was given by Huygens for the purpose of tracing both rays in the course of their refraction, founded on this idea","Copenhagen, Newton","IS,DK,US",8,"Iceland,Denmark,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Newton’s opposition to Huygens’ law as a state- DTA) ment of fact left it for more than a century under ^y^ollas- partial doubt. Haiiy is stated to have verified it, or ton; at least to have shown that it approached nearer to the truth than Newton’s ; but Dr Wollaston first re¬ established it in 1802 by conclusive experiments, which, however, he found it impossible to connect by a law until the previous generalization of Huygens had been pointed out to him,—most probably by Dr Young","Newton, Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"(479.) Malus had already, in the end of 1808, announced Huygens’ a property of light which, if not absolutely new, was so with reference to the circumstances in tionby'calcwhich it was produced. The polarization of light spar. was in reality discovered by Huygens previous to 1680. He had observed that the two rays into which common light is divided in passing through Iceland spar have a singular diversity of character, which Newton afterwards described as an opposite polarity",Newton,"IS,US",8,"Iceland,United States","Europe,North America"
"Huygens showed that if two rhombs of doubly re¬ fracting spar are laid symmetrically one upon the other, the “ extraordinary” ray yielded by the first is extraordinarily refracted by the second, and the “ordi¬ nary” ray from the first is ordinarily refracted by the second. But when we revolve the upper rhomb as it lies upon the lower one through a right angle, a remarkable change appears. The extraordinary ray escaping from the first is now ordinarily re¬ fracted by the second, and vice versa, so that the qualities of the two rays differ but only so far as this, that either may be assimilated to the other by making it (or the crystal from which it derives its properties) revolve round ninety degrees. A definite notion of such a distinction may be formed by imagining a musical string vibrating at one time in a vertical, at another in a horizontal, plane. If we could possibly imagine light to consist of vibrations of this descrip¬ tion, the two rays of Iceland spar might be conceived the one to vibrate in a plane passing through the axis of the crystal, the other in a plane perpendicular to that. Such light might truly be said to have ac¬ quired the property of having sides. In the language of Newton, it is 'polarized",Newton,"IS,US",8,"Iceland,United States","Europe,North America"
"His reputation amongst his intimates was extremely high, and it was generally believed, that had he sur¬ vived, his discoveries would have extended much far¬ ther.

"Diffraction Diffraction.—The theory of light in particular at- of light, tracted his attention, and he had a steady belief that the Newtonian doctrine was erroneous, though in ignorance, as it appears, of the undulatory doctrines of Hooke, Huygens, and Young. The phenomena of diffraction, or the coloured fringes which are seen in the interior of the shadows of opake bodies when illuminated by a minute source of light, attracted his attention as most proper for deciding the deli¬ cate question of the molecular or undulatory cha- Presnel’s racter of light. The results of his experiments were moii,me"" detailed in a memoir confided in the first place to his friend Arago, and by him communicated to the Institute of France (October 1815). This remark¬ able paper contained much which Dr Young had al¬ ready discovered, and the explanations of the experi¬ ments which it described, both new and old, by the theory of undulations, were common to both. Dr Young having anticipated the publication by at least a dozen years, there could be no question of pri¬ ority ; but it is equally certain that Fresnel was un¬ aware of what Young had done until it was pointed out to him by Arago. His memoir, which was pub¬ lished in great part in the Annales de Chimie for 1816, contains much which is interesting. The mode of observing the diffraction bands directly by means of a lens, without the intervention of a screen, was equally new and important. The observation that the interior fringes of the shadow of a narrow body, such as a wire, disappear when the light is intercepted on either side of the wire, leading to the conclusion that the union of the light from both sides is neces¬ sary for their occurrence, was (as we have seen) one of Young’s capital experiments. The explana¬ tion of Newton’s rings, by the interference of the light reflected from two adjacent surfaces, though partly anticipated by Hooke, was equally important. Nu¬ merous measures of the distances of the exterior diffraction bands from the geometrical shadow, as formed by homogeneous red light, are then given and compared with theory. Here Fresnel was on original ground. These accurate numerical comparisons, af¬ terwards pursued to a greater extent, constituted one of the most important bases of the new theory. In obtaining them he was materially aided by Arago, who, though considerably his senior, generously as¬ sisted him in every respect, and gave him the full ad¬ vantage of his station as a member of the Institute, and of his experience","Young, Young, Young, Young, Newton","UY,FR,US",8,"Uruguay,France,United States","South America,Europe,North America"
"Fresnel, however, guided by probable mechanical analogies, with an intuitive insight worthy of Newton himself, gave a formula for the intensity of reflected transverse vibrations, both when the plane of vibration of the molecules is in the plane of reflection, and when it is perpendicular to it; and he conceived common light to act as if equally composed of both sets of vibrations. His formulae embrace the non-reflection of polarized light at the critical angle, under the circumstances explained in the last section. It is a most remarkable fact that these inferences by Fresnel as to the numerical relations of the intensity of the re¬ flected to the incident light through all angles of inci¬ dence, anticipated almost every trustworthy photo- metrical measure; and from their singular though indirect accordance with many phenomena, they have been generally accepted as an expression of a natural law of great complexity, even by those who were not favourable to the theoretical views on which they are based.

"Chap. V., § 4.] OPTICS- by Sir D. Brewster. These proposals were all alike unknown to Fresnel, who had the grand merit, in a case of this kind, first, of carrying his happy idea into effectual execution, and secondly, of giving it a wonderful extension by the invention of a multitude of other forms of refracting and totally reflecting apparatus, till then unimagined as well as unexe¬ cuted.1 In 1823 the lighthouse of Corduan, at the mouth of the Garonne, was furnished with the new lenticular system, which was very skilfully executed by Soleil of Paris. The illumination was provided by means of a beautiful and powerful lamp with se¬ veral concentric wicks, the joint invention of Fresnel and Arago, which gave twenty-five times the light of the best Argand then in use. The system was found to work so well that it was speedily extended in France, then to Holland, and in the third place to Scotland, principally through the energy of the late Bobert Stevenson and the present Mr Alan Steven¬ son, his son, to the latter of whom we owe the best and most compendious treatise on the subject of lighthouses,2 as well as the noblest exemplification of it in the Skerryvore Lighthouse, erected by him in 1843. The same small work contains the details of Fresnel’s admirably ingenious applications of the principle of refraction to the distribution of light under almost every circumstance, which were not, however, published by their inventor","Paris, Holland","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"(502.) From the period of his election to the Institute, Arago’s Arago’s career was destitute of stirring incidents, but subsequent w from first to last, devoted chiefly to science. It is certain, however, that he was deficient in that power of continuous application, to which alone great dis¬ coveries are commonly due. Full of ingenious, origi¬ nal, and even profound conceptions, he shunned the labour of realizing them. His appointment to the charge of the Observatory of Paris was perhaps unfor¬ tunate. Well versed in the theory of astronomy, the minute drudgery of observation and the control of numerous assistants, was altogether uncongenial to him. It was a duty imperfectly fulfilled, to say the least, for 40 years: and it is needless to add how much the consciousness of habitual neglect of a duty deadens the faculty of useful application to anything else",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"The theory of this simple yet admirable experi¬ ment is one of the happiest examples of Fresnel’s mechanical explanation of double refraction. But it was not attained by a single step, nor effected by a single hand. Malus had observed the fact of depolarization, and the existence of perpendicular neutral axes in the crystalline plate. Arago added to this the knowledge of the phenomena of colour, which Sir David Brewster also observed indepen¬ dently somewhat later. He also invented a par¬ ticular theory to explain them by what he termed moveable 'polarization. But it wras not a success¬ ful effort. M. Biot assiduously studied the empi¬ rical laws of these periodic colours, and traced their dependence on the thickness of the interposed plate, according to a law similar to that of Newton’s rings. Young made an important step farther. He attributed the colour to the interference of the ordi¬ nary and extraordinary rays into which the incident light was divided on entering the crystalline plate ; and he showed by accurate calculation that the retar¬ dation of the slower-moving of the two rays during their passage through the plate, did in fact produce the difference of phase necessary for developing the tints observed by their reunion on leaving the plate, according to the usual laws of interference; and he showed that this theory coincided with M. Biot’s rules.1 But even this was not enough to explain the facts. It wras not clear why the colours due to doubly- refracting plates should not be seen without reaching the eye through an analyzer, or calc-spar prism. To Arago and Fi'esnel jointly we owe the important reply to this difficulty, which in fact forced upon the latter the idea of transversal vibrations. Their joint experiments (mentioned in the last section, art. 488), had shown that oppositely polarized rays cannot in¬ terfere unless they have, first, a common origin and a common plane of polarization; and, secondly, unless they be reduced to a common plane of polaiization (that is, analyzed) before falling on the eye or the screen : so that the theory of the colours of crystal¬ lized plates is, briefly, as follows :— Polarized light is represented by transverse vibra¬ tions of ether, the particles moving all in one plane","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"ence of length of path for the two rays which under¬ went crystalline separation within the plate, and also on the length of a wave of light (for this determines the phase of polarization at emergence). But the wave of light varies in length for each colour, consequently every colour has its maximum under different circum¬ stances, and if the incident light be white, the light falling after reflection on a screen will present mixed tints similar to those of Newton’s rings",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

"(512.) tion by the doctrine of interference of the colours of Newton’s rings received an important confir¬ mation from an experiment of Arago’s, which proved them to arise from the mixture of the pencils of light reflected at the two neighbouring sur¬ faces. He pressed a lens of glass against a plate of metal, in which case the central spot is white or black when light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence is reflected at an angle greater or less than the polarizing angle for glass ; and the rings vanish altogether at the polarizing angle ;—results which have been found conformable to the undulatory theory.1 He also discovered the peculiarity of the rays transmitted along the axis of a crystal of quartz",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"The most singular fact is, that by turning round the analyzing plate, no position of neutrality is found, but a series of colours similar to those of Newton’s scale succeed one another. Arago showed that this effect is due to a rotatory motion of the plane of polar¬ ization within the crystal. The rotation is greater for the violet than the red ray; this was shown by M. Biot, who also discovered that in some specimens the rotation takes place from right to left, in others from left to right—a peculiarity connected with cer¬ tain crystallographic modifications, as was first shown by Sir John Herschel",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Arago continued to attach great importance to the /5U obtaining of a still more direct proof of this fact, which Experi- he considered as a crucial one between the rival hypo- ment to the theses of Newton and Huygens. In his last years he had the satisfaction of witnessing the accomplishment cault. °U' of it, with the result he anticipated, and by a method which he had himself indicated. In 1838, he had al¬ ready indicated the application of Mr Wheatstone’s beautiful invention of the revolving mirror,4 as a means of measuring intervals of time incredibly short, in order to compare the velocity of light in air, and in a corre¬ sponding length ofwater. He even caused an apparatus to be partly prepared, but we have seen that Arago’s forte was rather in suggesting than in completing re¬ searches.

"(520.) Sir David Brewster was born at Jedburgh, in His early Scotland, on the 11th December 1784. He was studies. educated for the Scottish Church, and having en¬ tered the University of Edinburgh at a very early age, pursued his studies under Robison, Playfair, and Stewart, and formed the friendship of those eminent men. Amongst fellow-students of no common distinction who at that time frequented the college lectures, and of whom not a few were destined to signalize themselves in literature, science, and the career of politics, he formed the particular acquaint¬ ance of Mr, now Lord Brougham, and through him was led to study the inflection of light, and to repeat Newton’s experiments. This was in 1799 ; nor did he afterwards lose sight of a science which he was so signally to improve. The distraction of other occupations, the calls of his profession, and his indifferent health prevented, however, any very constant application to optics: and the part of the subject he then principally studied was rather connected with the use and theory of instruments than with physical optics in the sense in which we have explained it. This is evident from his first separate publication in 1813, “ on new Philosophical Instru¬ ments,” which, though containing many ingenious and valuable suggestions, fell short of the importance of his subsequent publications","University, Edinburgh, Newton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"When a plate of topaz, split by natural cleavage, was presented between the polarizing and analyzing plate (or rhomb of calc-spar), and at the same time inclined in a certain manner, the colours were no longer in broad sheets, but, if viewed closely, they arranged themselves in oval rings of great beauty, presenting orders of mixed colour analogous to those described by Newton when formed between convex glasses, and they were traversed by dark or white brushes as the analyzing plate was held in the dark or bright position. A second such system was observed inclined at an (apparent) angle of 65° in the same plate",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"Dr Wollaston afterwards (1814) discovered a phe- (530.) nomenon equally beautiful in calcareous spar, ofPhenornena which Sir D. Brewster had already perceived traces tfon^shown in some other crystals. Concentric with the posi- by uniaxal tion of the axis of double refraction (or optic axis), crystals, in a crystal of that mineral cut with two parallel faces perpendicular thereto, a series of perfectly sym¬ metric and exquisitely coloured rings are seen in po¬ larized light, having a white or black cross travers¬ ing them, according to the position of the analyzing plate. This magnificent phenomenon, which (except¬ ing, of course, the rings of biaxal crystals mentioned above) has perhaps no parallel in optical science, is seen in the most perfect manner possible in an appa¬ ratus constructed solely of Iceland spar, cemented by Canada balsam. A Nicol’s single-image prism1 is used to polarize, another to analyze the light, and between them is a plate of calcareous spar properly cut. It is a truly astonishing paradox to see the union of three perfectly transparent and colourless crystals display by their union such an exquisite combination of form and colour. The pole or centre of the rings in calc-spar coinciding with the axis of double refraction, of necessity suggested the idea that topaz, which shows two systems of rings arranged round two poles, must possess two axes of double refraction ; in other words, that there must exist within the crystal two directions (not mere lines), parallel to which a transmitted ray emerges without subdivision into two pencils",,"IS,CA",8,"Iceland,Canada","Europe,North America"
"This probable conjecture was verified by careful (531.) obseiwation, not only in topaz, but also in a vast Double sys- variety of other crystals which were found by Sir t®ar“s David Brewster much more commonly to possess two^’ m re’ than one system of rings. Amongst the earliest ex¬ amples which he observed were nitre, mica, acetate of lead, and Rochelle salt. Of these the first is exceed¬ ingly remarkable for the small inclination of the axes (about 5°) which permits both systems of rings to be readily observed at once. It was not, however, for some years (1817) that he reduced these most 1 The invention of a most ingenious person, the late Mr William Nicol of Edinburgh.

"V. Of Sir David Brewster’s experiments on the (536.) absorption of light wre must speak much more Absorption briefly. White light is coloured or analyzed byofliSht- refraction (as in a prism); by simple interference, as in Newton’s rings ; by double refraction combined with polarization. But it is also decomposed in a way which, primarily at least, seems different from all these,—by passing through coloured, or ratner, colouring media, whether solids, liquids, or gases, as red glass, ink, chlorine. This, the most familiar mode of coloration, is the most difficult to account for, and has been (on account of its obscurity) less studied than the others. In some instances, the complementary colour (that which, added to the transmitted tint, makes up white light) is entirely absorbed or lost; in other cases it is reflected at or near the first surface of the medium. Sometimes (533.) Chap. V., § 5.] OPTICS.—SIR D. BREWSTER—FRAUNHOFER",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"2 The peculiarity of these spectra is this, that they consist of pure colours, whilst almost all interference-colours are, like those of Newton’s rings, mixed and impure. One result is very remarkable. Fraunhofer obtained his spectra of such brilliancy as to be able to measure the position of the dark lines (an evidence of their exceeding purity), thus obtaining & standard spectrum in which the material of the prism has no influence whatever in varying the ratio of the dispersion of the various colours",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

It is an analysis of the coloured light of the (so-called) homogeneous rays of the pure spectrum by the specific action of absorbing substances. Sir D.

But as grave doubts have been thrown on the results, especially by the recent careful experiments of Helmholz, I shall not further insist upon them here.1 Still less can I take notice of a multitude of microscopic researches on a variety of objects in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdom, and on the physiology of vision, with which Sir D.

Hence a ray incident externally so as to be refracted along this perpen¬ dicular, will at entrance spread into a hollow cone interior to the crystal, and on emergence at a parallel face each portion of the ray recovers a direction parallel to its primitive direction, and a luminous hollow cylinder is the result.

"3 Sir W. R. Hamilton is also a discoverer in pure analysis and its connection with geometry. Following up the ideas of Mr Warren on the geometrical significance of the symbol \/ — 1, as indicative of direction, Sir W. Hamilton has developed the theory of a new class of imaginary quantities, which he terms quaternions, by means of which he contrives to express simultaneously the direction in space and magnitude of a line or form ; and this calculus he has applied to the solutions of problems of geometry and physical astronomy. The quaternion appears to express something even beyond this ; and this redundancy has been consi¬ dered as a difficulty by some mathematicians. The superfluous number is considered by Sir W.

"(554.) Numerous mathematicians of eminence at home theories1 of1 an<^ a^roafl entered upon the same arduous enquiry, vibratory To attempt to deduce from the hypothetical constitu- motion. tion of a very rare highly-elastic medium, together with the known dynamic laws, thevarious complicated facts of optics, was a problem whose difficulty was only equalled by its indefinite character. For how little do we know of the molecular constitution of such fluids as air and water ? How much less then of a fluid (if we may so term it) almost infinitely rarer, and incapable of being inclosed, measured, or weighed ? The bare possibility of transversal undulations was long contested by very able mathematicians ; and con¬ ceding it, the mutual influence of such an ether and the particles of gross matter (as shown by reflection and refraction) must, it would seem, for ever remain problematical. Yet, however gratuitous or even er¬ roneous our reasonings about such ultimate questions may be, there is no doubt a real benefit in obtaining from them at least a mathematical congruity with ob¬ served facts. The progress of science shows that there is a practical usefulness in this step. On the other hand, we must not be discouraged to find that there are so many handles to the matter, that even the most profound thinkers may conceive that they have reached the proposed end by different and incongruous routes. Besides the mathematicians whom I have mentioned, many others were in the field; for the result of tremors propagated through elastic media of different kinds is an enquiry of ex¬ cessive generality, and forms a part of many branches of science besides optics. MM. Cauchy, Navier, Poisson, Coriolis, Green, Kelland, and Neumann are amongst those who attacked the problem. For a series of years memoirs rose fast and thick on this favourite battle-field; and even a skilful mathematician might find it no small penance to discuss the merits of the various hypotheses and the solidity of the respective deductions which were proposed",Green,US,8,United States,North America
"rays 1; the existence of normal vibrations seems to be proved by the ingenious experiments of M. Jamin, showing that at no angle is light perfectly polarized by reflection. The more we see of these diversities arising in the progress of science, the less are we disposed to found on merely mathematical conclu¬ sions from an assumed constitution of elastic bodies ; the more, on the other hand, do we admire the ad¬ mirable sagacity of Fresnel—the real Newton of modern optics—few of even the least of whose sug¬ gestive anticipations have fallen to the ground",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

The principle selected as the basis of the reasoning contained in the follow- ing paper is this: In whatever way the elements of any material system act upon each other, if all the internal forces exerted be multiplied by the elements of their respective directions, the total sum for any assigned portion of the mass will always be the exact differential of some function. But this function being known, we can immediately apply the general method given in the Mecanique Analytique, and which appears to be more especially applicable to problems that relate to the motions of systems of an immense number of particles mutually acting on each other. One of the advantages of this method, of great importance, is, that we are. necessarily led by the mere process of the calculation, and, with little care on our part, to all the equations and conditions which are requisite and sufficient for the complete solution of any problem to which it may be applied.” A consideration of the candid admissions of the preceding paragraphs (especially the last sentence) will lead the reader to see ow short a way a theory of so general a kind—the chief characteristic of which consists in eluding every troublesome physical enquiry can go towards explaining the relations of Light to Matter; yet it may be of use by indicating the kind of solutions w ich more restricted hypothesis may be expected to give of the laws of phenomena",Green,US,8,United States,North America

"In 1814 J. Nicephore Niepce, a retired proprie- (569.) tor at Chalons sur Saone,2 entered into a similar en- ^g6^01,6 quiry, but by methods quite different. He employed ^iep the solar effect upon resinous bodies, and some at least of his pictures were executed on plates of pewter or of rolled silver. They were mostly copies of engravings, and the light parts corresponded to the lights of the originals. He, however, at length suc¬ ceeded in fixing impressions of vieAvs in the camera obscura, though in an imperfect manner, and after very long exposure. The pictures thus obtained had this in common with more perfect processes, that the lu¬ minous impression was first brought into view by a chemical process subsequent to exposure in the camera. In 1825 Nicephore Niepce became associated with Daguerre, who had previously been engaged in Daguerre, the same research ; they agreed to communicate the results of their several experiments. The result, as is well known, was the invention of the Daguerreo¬ type, not improperly called after Daguerre, who seems really to have worked it out almost entirely for himself, after the death of Niepce in 1833; whilst so patient and determined was Daguerre in Mrs Mary 1 The maiden name of this accomplished lady was Mary Somerville ; she was born, I believe, at Jedburgh, and married first Mr Somerville Greig, afterwards her relative Dr Somerville. She is known in British science not only as the able commentator of Laplace’s Meca- — magne- nique Celeste, but as the author of some ingenious and apparently convincing experiments on the magnetizing power of the violet tic action ray. Some anomaly, however, remains to be explained on this subject, as the result cannot always be obtained. Several years of light [?]. before Dr Faraday made his discovery of what he terms the “ magnetization of light” (see chapter vii., § 5), the writer of these pages supposed that the reaction of light and magnetism, observed by Morichini and Mrs Somerville, might be due to a la¬ tent and casual polarization of the light which was not present in all the experiments ; and, in particular, he suspected that circu¬ larly polarized light might have a magnetic influence; but his experiments to this effect, in May 1836, were not successful, though he thinks them worth repeating",Laplace,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

"Heatc i Bown to the close of the 18th century, the science dered in Heat was studied and advanced mainly by che- the 18th mists, and it was in all respects treated as a branch century as 0f Chemistry ; a position of which we still find traces of chemis- introduction of the doctrines of heat (even of try. radiant heat) into most of our approved treatises on Chemistry. This circumstance brings us, in this chapter, into close contact with the most illustrious chemical names of the second half of the last century and of the first years of the present. Such were Black, Cavendish, Lavoisier, and Dalton. Of the last and two first it may be doubted whether they were not as prominent discoverers in Physics as in Chemistry","Dalton, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"Davy occupies a similar position. It was not, in¬ deed, until the 19th century had made some pro¬ gress that Chemistry assumed a strongly distinctive position of its own, and began to attain that large development and complex character of detail which render it a science now hardly accessible to those who do not devote to it their almost undivided at¬ tention. In the days of Black and Cavendish it was otherwise ; and in the first section of the present chapter I shall attempt to give an outline of the characters of the very remarkable men who then advanced simultaneously the doctrines of Physics and Chemistry; referring:, of course, chiefly to the former, but not entirely to the exclusion of the lat¬ ter portion of their researches, particularly with respect to the atomic and gaseous theories of Dal¬ ton, which have a strongly physical aspect. I have elsewhere noticed the barrenness of the greater part of the 18th century in contributions to the experi¬ mental sciences; the temptation is therefore the greater to dwell a little even on the personal history of men so celebrated and influential as Black, Caven¬ dish, and Dalton",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

It is suffi¬ cient for me to state that he entered the University of Glasgow as a student in 1746. Being destined for the medical profession, he removed in 1750 or 1751 to Edinburgh, where he benefited especially by the lectures of Cullen, a most eminent physician, and the author of a beautiful experiment on the cold produced during evaporation. Before Black gradu¬ ated (in 1754) he had entered upon a course of chemi¬ cal experiments connected with the causticity of many earthy bodies, which ended in his first (and perhaps most famous) discovery of the existence of fixed air or carbonic acid gas as an essential constituent of marble and other solids, together with a train of important consequences. Few inaugural dissertations have been so interesting to science as that on Magnesia, printed at Edinburghin 1754, which contained these results. But, on this purely chemical question we will not enlarge","Ferguson, University, Glasgow, Edinburgh","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"He compared the time required under the action of a uniform source of heat to raise the temperature of a certain quantity of water from 50° to the boiling point, with that required to boil it away; and in¬ ferring that heat was continually combining with the water at the same rate, he estimated the latent heat, or heat of vapour, to be as great as would have raised the temperature of the water had that been possible by 810°. This was in October 1762 ;2 about two years later his pupil, Irvine, made experiments under Exper;_ his direction with a still and refrigeratory, by which ments of he estimated the heat given out by steam during its Irvine and reconversion into water. Mr W att prosecuted the ^att- same inquiry soon after.3 How happily Mr Watt applied the doctrine of latent heat thus brought ex¬ perimentally under his notice, to the improvement of the steam-engine, has been already recorded","Irvine, Irvine",US,8,United States,North America
"927 the volumes or the weights of those ingredients were equal. “ Quicksilver, whether it were applied hot to cold water or cold to hot water, never produced more effect in heating or cooling an equal measure of the water than would have been produced by water equally hot or cold with the quicksilver, and only two-thirds of its bulk.” Of course, Avhen equal weights were used, the inequality of effect was still more striking, for, from the great density of quick¬ silver, it required no less than 30 times the weight of the -water mixed with it in order that it should con¬ tribute in an equal degree to the production of a mean temperature. Strange to say, the interpreta¬ tion of this important experiment remained to be made by Dr Black after half a century. He taught that temperature is an effect of heat, which is neither the same in all bodies nor in the same body under differing circumstances; that the superior effect of the water to the mercury in determining the tempe¬ rature of the mixture was caused by the fact, that it is the nature of quicksilver to require a smaller amount of heat to raise its temperature through one degree than an equal volume or weight of water would require under like conditions. Black made many experiments to satisfy himself of the constancy of this property in bodies; and with the assistance of Irvine,1 probably ascertained its nume¬ rical value (the amount of heat necessary to raise an unit of mass of -water through one degree of tempe¬ rature being the standard) in different cases ; but he left the subject chiefly in the hands of that observer and of Watt. The former gave the name of ca¬ pacity for heat to this property, which was after- wards more happily termed specific heat by Gadolin, who made many experiments on the subject, as did also Cavendish and Adair Crawford whose theory of animal heat, published in 1778, turns entirely on this property of bodies","Of, Irvine","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"
"Irvine had the merit, such as it was, of proposing a theory on which his term capacity for heat was capacity of principally founded, which occasioned for many years bodies for after, although now comparatively forgotten, much discussion. He assumed that the changes in the temperature of bodies, whether by alteration of their mechanical condition or by chemical combina¬ tion, were due to a change in the capacity for heat of the substance or the mixture. He also assumed that the total amount of heat contained in a body is pro¬ portional to the amount of heat necessary to raise its temperatui’e through one degree (for example, a pound of mercury contains altogether one-thirtieth part of the entire heat contained in a pound of water)",Irvine,US,8,United States,North America
"From these principles he deduced the temperature of absolute zero or privation of heat as follows :—When sulphuric acid and water are mixed together, the tem¬ perature rises. This rise, according to him, is caused by the capacity for heat of the mixture being less (589.) Irvine’s theory of heat",Irvine,US,8,United States,North America
"than the average due to its ingredients. He has, there¬ fore, got the ratio of the whole heat in the bodies before mixture and after mixture. He has also got the number of degrees of temperature corresponding to this difference. Elaving the ratio of these quan¬ tities, and also their difference, the quantities them¬ selves, or the whole amount of heat expires sed in de¬ grees of temperature before and after mixture, become known, and the temperature of absolute privation of heat is also known. He applied the same reasoning, with great ingenuity, to explain the latent heat of li¬ quids and vapours, which he ascribed to their increasing capacities. He thence deduced other values for the absolute zero ; but whereas all these determinations ought to have agreed, at least approximately, they were found by later experimenters, especially by La¬ voisier and Dalton, to differ so widely—even by se¬ veral thousand degrees—that, since the time of the latter, this ingenious theory has been nearly aban¬ doned, at least as far as the search after the zero is concerned; although undoubtedly change in the spe¬ cific heat of bodies is often an important element in determining their temperature",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

Though he published one or two papers during these thirty years, they were of comparatively trifling importance",University,US,8,United States,North America
"4 I find an apology almost necessary for introducing at some length the biography of Cavendish into a chapter professedly on Heat, his positive discoveries connected with which were less notable than in some other departments. But besides that his posi¬ tion in the first rank of chemists naturally indicates his place to be between Black and Dalton, I felt a wdsh to bring out the relief of the striking intellectual characteristics of those three remarkable men, by placing them in juxtaposition. I may add that these three sections were the earliest written of this Dissertation, at a time when I had hoped to interweave into its compo¬ sition more of the purely biographical character of each period of scientific history than I found it afterwards practicable in all instances to carry out.

Such a man was Cavendish; and that he should stoop even to the common artifices of little minds for exalting his own reputation at the ex¬ pense of others, would itself be incredible ; how much more the insinuation (grounded solely on alleged cir¬ cumstantial evidence) that in doing so he disregarded the plainest dictates of honour and justice",Newton,US,8,United States,North America

But it is needless to dwell upon these obser¬ vations, however original, because they were volun¬ tarily suppressed by the author, and have only re¬ cently been brought to light from his manuscripts.1 What he did publish in connection with this subject was a paper on the construction and graduation of meteorological instruments, especially thermometers, and others on the temperature at which mercury freezes, and on freezing mixtures. The former of these papers was, as might be expected, far in ad¬ vance of its age in the degree of exactness which was showm to be attainable in the construction of ther¬ mometers, and scarcely even now can it be considered as obsolete. The papers on freezing mercury finally corrected the exaggerated notion at first entertained of the extreme cold at which that metal becomes solid, and also contain valuable views on the sub¬ ject of congelation, and fixed the latent heat of water at 150°. He calls this, “generation of heat” during liquefaction, objecting to Blades term as relating “ to an hypothesis, depending on the supposition that the heat of bodies is owing to their containing more or less of a substance, called the matter of heat; and as I think Sir Isaac Newton’s opinion that heat con¬ sists in the internal motion of the particles of bodies much the most probable, I chose to use the expres¬ sion, heat is generated.”2 Two of Cavendish’s most important researches re¬ fer to the attraction and density of the earth, and to the mathematical theory of electricity.

In the memoirs of the Aca- specific demy of Sciences for 1780 (published 1784), we heat, find an important paper on Heat written in conjunc¬ tion with Laplace, in which the calorimeter is de¬ scribed, though not under that appellation, together with its applications and their results. The prin¬ ciple of the calorimeter is too well known to require to be detailed here; but the authors of the joint memoir refer, with commendable precision, to the pre¬ vious labours of Wilcke of Sweden, who first employed the melting of snow to measure the quantities of heat given off by bodies in cooling. To Laplace and La¬ voisier, is, however, due an important addition which could alone impart any value to the results,—that of the external chamber of ice which prevents fusion taking place by the contact of the external air and by radiation. The French philosophers were not so successful in eliminating the other source of inac¬ curacy specified by Wilcke, which arises from the difficulty of drawing off the whole of the melted water. Sir John Herschel has of late years proposed what seems to be an important improvement on the calorimeter, by filling the interstices of the snow or ice with water, and estimating the quantity of the former melted by the contraction of volume'of the compound mass. I am not aware that it has been as yet practised. I have stated in Art. (88) one ground on which the idea of the calorimeter (so far as not anticipated by Wilcke), may be probably ascribed to Laplace.

Had we wished to invent a striking antithesis in the per¬ sonal histories of the cultivators of science, or to illustrate merely the various soils on which rich crops of discovery may be reared, we could scarcely have imagined more striking contrasts than in the social positions and advantages of Black, Cavendish, and Dalton—three of the names which we have selected in illustration of the history of physics of their age","Cumberland, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America

"At the age of thirteen he had commenced the ardu- (611.) ous office of an instructor; and from 1781 to 1792 pursued the same occupation in a humble sphere at Kendal, where he fortunately became acquainted with Mr Gough, a blind gentleman of some fortune, who devoted his time to the prosecution of science in nearly all its branches, and particularly of mathe¬ matical subjects, of which he has left an enduring record in many ingenious papers, published chiefly in the Manchester Transactions and in Nicholson's Journal. He patronized young Dalton, giving him free access to his library and apparatus, and receiv¬ ing from him in return the benefit of his assistance in prosecuting his experiments. Dalton always recog¬ nised (as he had unquestionably good reason to do) the merits of his patron, and the importance of the advantages which he had derived from his advice and example. Indeed, without some such fortunate concurrence of circumstances (and something simi¬ lar may be noted in the history of nearly all self- educated men), it could hardly have been hoped that Dalton would have been so well grounded in the ma¬ thematical principles of at least some branches of Natural Philosophy as he probably was. For, though his discoveries bear mainly on the science of chemis¬ try in the wide sense in which it was then under¬ stood, yet geometrical precision is after all their fun¬ damental characteristic ; and whether in treating of the constitution of a gas, or of the scale of a thermo¬ meter, or of the composition of a salt, it is evident that numbers and ratios were the ideas predominating in 1 Life of Dalton, by Dr Henry, in the publications of the Cavendish Society.

"(613.) I. We shall first speak of his researches connected Researches with gases and vapours. It had been noticed by and’va-3 Priestley and others that when gases exercising ap- pours. parently no chemical action upon one another, are mixed in a confined space, they become, after the lapse of a longer or shorter time, completely inter¬ mingled, and that without any regard to even great differences in their density, the particles of the lighter gas diffusing themselves contrary to gravity through those of the denser, and causing them in their turn to ascend. The uniform composition of our atmo¬ sphere, in all circumstances and at all heights, is a striking example of this property. In explanation of it, Dalton had in 1801 arrived at the conclusion, “ that the particles of one gas are not elastic or re¬ pulsive in regard to the particles of another gas, but only to the particles of their own kind.” The fun¬ damental experiment on which this singular con¬ clusion was based was the following:—That the quantity of vapour of water (which, when purely elastic, may be considered as a gas) which can exist uncondensed in a given space, depends solely upon the temperature, and is independent of the presence of air and of its own density. Thus water, or any other evaporable liquid, being introduced into a space con¬ taining air, or any . other gas, of any density, but subject to a constant external pressure, the space in question becomes damp by the evaporation of the liquid ; now the amount of the latter converted into vapour depends, according to Dalton, upon the single circumstance that the vapour yielded by it must have the precise elasticity due to its temperature","Dalton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"Its elastic force being added to that of the dry air, the whole will expand until equilibrium is restored with the constant pressure without, and this will oc¬ cur as soon as the elasticity of the dry air alone (proper to its increased volume), addhd to the elasticity of the vapour alone (depending solely on its tempera¬ ture), are together equal to the pressure which they have to support. In short, to use the precise enun¬ ciation of Dalton himself, “ in all cases the vapour rises to a certain force, according to temperature, and the air adjusts the equilibrium by expanding or contracting as may be required.”1 * The importance of this law (easily verified in the (614.) particular case) is readily perceived. Not only did Theory of it affect the results of almost every experiment in bygronie- pneumatic chemistry, but it rendered a new theory oft1^’ hygrometry indispensable. The older theory of Hal¬ ley, Leroy, and Franklin was, that the direct affinity between air and water drew up a portion of the lat¬ ter into the former with the aid of heat, whilst De Saussure (Essai sur VHygrom^trie, 1783) believed that the conversion of water into vapour took place first and independently by the action of heat, and that it was then drawn up into the atmosphere by the at¬ traction of the gases which compose it. Dalton’s experiments show that the air and the vapour mix without the slightest mutual interference or reac¬ tion. He founded thereupon an excellent prac¬ tical method of determining the amount of vapour in the atmosphere. He first formed a table of the elasticities of watery vapour or steam for all tem¬ peratures between 32° and 212°; and so simple and accurate were his methods, at least for the lower de¬ grees of the thermometer, that his numbers are still received as amongst the best we have. He operated merely with a carefully constructed barometer, into the vacuum of which he introduced a few drops of water, and raising the temperature by means of a tube embracing it, and which could be filled with water at pleasure, he observed carefully the depres¬ sion of the mercurial column. The elasticities thus determined commenced with 0‘2 inches of mercury at 32° up to 30 inches at 212°. These numbers, con¬ sequently, represent the utmost elasticities of vapour which can exist either in air or without air at the cor¬ responding tempei’ature. If we attempt to add more vapour, or to lower the temperature, in either case moisture will be deposited. Hence to find the quan- Dew-point tityof vapour in the atmosphere when not absolutely damp, it is sufficient to ascertain the temperature at which it becomes so. This Dalton did by filling a 1 The exact expression of the effect is this, v———, where p represents the pressure expressed in inches of mercury upon a . “P given volume (equal to unity) of dry air; f the force of the vapour in vacuo at the temperature of experiment, also in inches of mercury ; and v the volume which the mixture of air and vapour occupies under the given pressure p after saturation. It is evident thatp —/ being the pressure due to the elasticity of the dry air apart from the vapour, when we affirm that the volume (1) becomes ——y, we in effect affirm that Mariotte’s (or Boyle’s) law connecting volume and pressure holds true for air which is mixed with vapour, just as though vapour were absent or its space void","Dalton, Franklin, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"(615.) These important laws and deductions being fully mixed°f understood, the theory of the mixed dry gases follows gases. as a simple corollary. For it merely asserts of them what has been admitted in the case of steam, that they may diffuse themselves, and exert their elastic forces quite independently of one another; so that, for example, in our atmosphere the total pressure is made up of the partial elasticities of the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid which compose it, each acting to the same amount as if it alone had existed in the space which it occupies. In his essay of 1801, Dal¬ ton stated his view of these facts thus :—“ The par¬ ticles of one elastic fluid may possess no repulsion or attractive power, or be perfectly inelastic with regard to the particles of another.” (616.) Discoveries so practical could not fail to excite Daitoirs immediate attention, especially at a time when the ideason*5**1 researc*ies chemists were earnestly directed towards the subject. ^,e gases- “ The facts and experiments,” Dalton tells us in his Chemical Philosophy, “were highlv valued ; some of the latter were repeated and found correct, and none of the results controverted; but the theory was almost universally misunderstood.” Its opponents were Berthollet, Thomson, Henry, and others, and the replies of the author are contained in the work just cited. But he appears to have felt the force of the objection, “ Can it be conceived that an elastic substance exists which adds its volume to that of another, and which, nevertheless, does not act on it by its expansive force V—for in his chemical phi¬ losophy he abandons the comparison of gaseous par¬ ticles to similar magnetic poles which repel each other, but are inert towards non-magnetic matter, and allowing that heat is the primary cause of repulsion in all gases, ascribes their diffusion contrary to gravity to the dissimilar size of their spherical molecules",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"“ The particles of one kind being from their size un¬ able to apply properly to the other, no equilibrium can ever take place amongst the heterogeneous mole¬ cules. The intestine motion,” he adds, “ must there¬ fore continue till the particles arrive at the opposite surface of the vessel against any point of which they can rest with stability, and the equlibrium at length is acquired, when each gas is uniformly diffused through the other.” It may be seriously doubted whether this theory of the facts will bear examina¬ tion, at least no attempt has been made to demon¬ strate it on mechanical principles. The subject has been allowed to remain during more than forty years of unequalled activity in such speculations without ma¬ terial light being thrown upon the proximate causes of these wonderfully general and simple truths. Yet it can hardly be doubted that the mechanical theory of the gases and vapours is capable of a great exten¬ sion, and even of being illustrated by simple experi¬ ments. But the attention of chemists has been with¬ drawn from the physical bearings of their science by the prodigious increase in the number of compounds which they have had to analyze and classify. The most important sequel to Dalton’s discoveries has probably been that of Professor Graham, whose ex- Mr Gra- periments prove that gases when separated by a ham’s Jaw- porous partition permeate it in both directions, until °.f dlffu"" they have mixed in proportions which are inversely as the square root of their density. This law clearly shows the purely mechanical causes by which the diffusion is effected",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"A discovery of Dalton, which has scarcely been (617.) considered second in importance to those we haveDalton on mentioned, is that the rate of expansion of all gases gioi^of the by heat is the same. Thus thermometers of air, hydro- gases by gen, and carbonic acid would all markthesame degree heat- when plunged in the same medium ; whilst the mer¬ curial thermometer shows a more rapid expansion, at higher temperatures, if the air thermometer be taken as the standard. This important fact was soon after but independently announced by Gay-Lussac of Paris. Dalton’s publication dates from 1801. In his Chemical Philosophy, he gives his view of the difficult subject of a true thermometric scale; which he does not suppose to be correctly represented by the simple expansion of any known substance; but that the gases expand with true increments of heat in a very slow geometrical progression, whilst li¬ quids expand as the squares of the true temperatures from their freezing points. These and other laws equally arbitrary have not received support from later and more precise experiments; and in the se¬ cond volume of his work (1827) he freely acknow¬ ledges the correction of his hypothesis by the more recent French experiments","Dalton, Dalton, Paris, Dalton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"II. I now proceed to the other part of Dalton’s (618.) labours on which his reputation is principally based; ^tomb;8 namely, the clear assertion and experimental esta- Theory, blishment of the Atomic Theory or doctrine of chemi¬ cal equivalents. I introduce it here on account of its important bearing on all physical questions in which the constitution of matter and the forces act¬ ing at minute distances are involved",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"Early opinions on the constitution of matter and (619.) chemical combination.—Two opinions have prevailed Gariy opi- from the very earliest times respecting the constitu- tion of body :—that which supposes its entire homo- tution^f1 geneousness, and that which allows that it consists matter, of material parts or atoms separated by void spaces; these parts or atoms being indivisible. This last is the doctrine of Democritus and Epicurus, and in modern times of Bacon, Newton, and Dalton.1 The former opinion has been held by Leibnitz, and many 1 The reader will find ample details on the opinions of the older philosophers in Daubeny’s Introduction to the Atomic Theory, 936 MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE","Newton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America

They are, according to his view, pon- the'subject ^eraWe> indivisible masses, having length, breadth, and thickness, consequently form. He had distinct conceptions of their relative weights, distances, and specific heats. He was particularly fond of depicting them in diagrams, to which he often refers for a clearer exposition of his views than he chose to give in words",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

"For the sake of distinctness t\\e facts of the atomic theory may be thus enumerated :—1. That when two bodies unite, not merely by mechanical mixture but through a chemical affinity of the elements,—two or more in- , gredientsforming a wholewith new properties,—these ingredients are invariably found to exist in constant proportions. For instance, the carbonate of lime in¬ variably consists of 44 parts by weight of carbonic acid and 56 of lime, the slightest addition of either element remaining uncombined, or only mechanically mixed with the chemical product. 2. In many instances, however, more than one chemical combi¬ nation can be formed between two or more elements, and in the simplest cases, where the elements are two in number and one remains constant in quantity whilst the other increases in amount, a fresh che¬ mical union of the particles does not occur until one of the ingredients reaches precisely double the amount and in Whewell’s Philos, of Inductive Sciences, vol. i. Xewton’s conjecture is expressed in these words :—“ All things considered, it seems probable that God, in the beginning, formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles, of such sizes, figures, and with such other properties, and in such proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which he formed them. And that these primitive particles being solids, are incomparably harder than any bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to wear or break to pieces; no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the first creation.” Horsley’s Newton, vol. iv., 260, quoted by Daubeny",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"1 A profound and subtle thinker of our own time (Mr Leslie Ellis, of Trinity College, Cambridge) has made a definite suggestion as to a possible form of chemical forces, viz., that they may not be such as are directly exerted between a particle A and a particle B, but only by their presence enable A to act on B, or bear the same relation to force (common force) as force in mechanics does to the motion which it causes. Thus, the science of mechanics would include—1st, Kinematics, or pure motion depending on equations of the first order ; 2d, Dynamics, depending on equations of the second order ; 3d, Chemical, Vital, &c., forces, depend¬ ing on equations of higher orders. Camb. Trans., viii., 604, &c",Cambridge,US,8,United States,North America
"Nor must we be surprised to find several claimants to a share of the honour. It is the invariable history of all great generalizations, that they have been partly anticipated; and it may serve to moderate the self- esteem of even the greatest discoverers, that however high may be their individual merits, they are in some sense the mere exponents of the aggregate know¬ ledge of their contemporaries. The laws of motion were partially anticipated before the time of Galileo, and could not have remained much longer undefined; and even the unparalleled discoveries of Newton must, in all probability, have ere long been made piecemeal by the united energy of his contemporaries and immediate successors. The steam-engine was not the sole creation of Watt, nor was Davy the first to apply the voltaic battery to chemistry. In like manner, Dalton’s laws of chemical combination were published at a happy moment, which gave them speedy acceptance with the active chemists of his day; whilst those who had seen with sufficient clear¬ ness portions of these laws twenty or thirty years before, addressed a scientific public by no means pre¬ pared to appreciate their value, or to feel a conviction of their generality. Had Wenzel,1 Higgins,2 and Wenzel, Richter3 individually apprehended the great impor- tance of the definite and multiple combining pro- Rlcl1* portions which they announced,—had they felt the theory of them to constitute the very foundations of chemistry,—they would not have rested until they had verified it in numerous details, and applied it to the various purposes of speculation and practice, as Dalton did. But whether from want of energy, or from ill fortune, their ideas sunk into entire oblivion; and the ingenuity and social position of Berthollet were giving a cui’rency to opinions respecting chemi¬ cal forces which tended to undo even the far more elementary notions of the constancy of elective affi¬ nities, at the time when Dalton’s researches were unostentatiously brought before the world. His first insight into the theory of chemical combinations dates from the year 1803. It was expounded by him both in conversation and by lectures in 1804, at which date Dr Thomas Thomson recorded the results of a conversation held with him at Manches¬ ter, which, three years later (evidently with Dalton’s approbation), he published in his work on Chemistry","Newton, Dalton, Dalton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"Finally, Dalton himself, in 1808, announced the prin¬ ciples of his theory at no greater length than five pages “ on Chemical Synthesis” in his Chemical Philosophy",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"Now, it is to be observed, that Dalton’s views were (623.) all along expressed in the language of a strictly Ato- Importance mic theory. Compounds are only chemically com- mic^heory plete, when one or several atoms of an element com- to the pro¬ bine with one, two, or more atoms of another. Any gress of superfluity of either element remains uncombined, or chemistry’ mechanically mixed. All the other parts of the laws of combination readily lead to the same idea, and, in fact, find in it their simplest expression. There is no wonder, then, that Dalton firmly believed in the physical existence of his atoms, and that the new properties of compounds are due to the peculiar mo¬ dification of the most elementary parts into which bodies can be divided without a loss of those proper¬ ties, that is, without decomposition. He figured these elementary molecules by uniting the symbols of their constituents, and by so doing, may be said to have laid the foundation of those algebraic sys¬ tems of technical notation, which speak to the eye only in another way from Dalton’s diagrams, and which have been of such eminent service to the chemist. Nor must we think too lightly of a hypo¬ thesis which served so materially to aid in realizing 1 Lehre von der Verwandschaft der Korper, 1777. He shows that in a double decomposition the new compounds are chemi¬ cally perfect","Dalton, Dalton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"a discovery of such magnitude. Dalton’s earlier re¬ searches were far more physical than chemical; and it is evident that the effort of representing to his mind, geometrically and atomically, the condition of mixed gases and vapours, led him to form clear ideas on the definiteness of chemical combinations",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"(624.) The reception of the views of Dalton was some- tionlrT1*"" w^at gradual, yet might be called rapid, considering England, the obscurity of the author, and his provincial resi¬ dence. The energy of Dr Thomson of Glasgow con¬ tributed more than any other circumstance to com¬ pel the attention of chemists. He personally brought it under the notice of Wollaston and Davy ; and the former, who, by his habits of precise thought and ac¬ curate experiment, as well as from his extensive che¬ mical knowledge, would of all others have been the most likely to see its importance and probability, was doubly predisposed in its favour by having been himself for some time in possession of facts illus¬ trating the numerical laws of combination similar to those which Dalton possessed. Wollaston published these in the Philosophical Transactions for 1808, in which he expressly states, that Dalton had antici¬ pated him in the results of bis enquiry into multiple combinations of elements. Davy, as might have been expected, was less prepared to accept a doctrine having the form of a mathematical law ; he did so, however, after a short resistance. In his Chemical Philosophy he ascribes most if not all the merit of it to Higgins, and is supposed to have looked coldly upon Dalton’s growing fame; but it is gratifying to add, that in almost his last appearance in public as president of the Royal Society, when presenting Dal¬ ton with the first royal medal, he should have ex¬ pressed himself in terms of cordial praise","Dalton, Glasgow, Dalton, Dalton, Dalton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"andFranee ^rance t^ie new doctrine soon spread, notwith- Gay-Lua- siding its violent contradiction to the theories of sac’s law of Berthollet. Gay-Lussac was amongst its earliest volumes, and most enlightened advocates; and he had the good fortune to add, in 1809, a new law to the principles of chemical combination, which is, that the gases, in uniting chemically, combine in equal or multiple volumes, and when any condensation occurs after they have united, it amounts to an exact frac¬ tion (-^ orl) of their joint bulk. This was the only addition made for a very long period to Dalton’s laws, even if we consider the theory of Isomorphism and of Substitutions to take the same rank; and as it evidently includes the idea that the atomic weights of the gases have a simple numerical relation to their densities, it confirms Dalton’s views of the great sim¬ plicity and uniformity of constitution of those bodies","Dalton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"It is not to be concluded, however, that the atomic (626.) or theoretical part of Dalton’s laws obtained the same “ Chemical currency with the conditions of chemical combina- lents tion which they serve to define. Wollaston and Prout were perhaps the most favourably disposed to the doctrine of atoms, though the former invented the term “ chemical equivalents” to escape from the theoretic inference, and the latter believed that Dal¬ ton’s law was only a portion of a more complicated one regulating chemical combinations. Wollaston even sought evidence in favour of ultimate atoms, from considerations of a purely mechanical kind, such as the existence of a limit to the atmosphere (Phil. Trans. 1822). We may however admit, with those who have taken an opposite view, that the finite extent of the atmosphere is consistent with a continuous mathematical law suitably assumed, and without reference to atoms at all; if, indeed, we can imagine a medium varying enormously in density, yet possessing perfect continuity of body. But we will not enlarge farther on these almost metaphysi¬ cal considerations",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"During the period from his settlement in Man- (627.) Chester in 1793, to the publication of his Chemical p^^ai Philosophy in 1808, Dalton was occupied in tuition, history first in the Mosley Street Institution, where he lec- continued, tured on mathematics and natural philosophy for six years, and afterwards, privately, in a very humble and unpretending manner. His speculations and ex¬ periments gradually became more and more strictly chemical; and, aware that his atomic theory was to be the great foundation of his fame, he spared no pains in illustrating it by numerous analyses. Con¬ temporary chemists have testified to the ingenuity and fidelity of these. Yet, isolated as he was, and unacquainted perhaps with those niceties of manipu¬ lation which are suggested by the experience of pro¬ fessional chemists, and rapidly communicated in great cities, his numerical conclusions were often inexact","Chester, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"939 early as 1816, elected a corresponding member of the Institute of France—Wollaston being then probably the only other English name on the list.1 Dalton found his way to Paris in 1822, and was agreeably surprised by the distinction with which he was re¬ ceived by the most eminent members of the Academy of Sciences. Perhaps this first 'personal recognition of his exalted station, as a man of science, had some¬ thing to do with the tardy adjudication to him four years later of one of the medals of the Royal Society of London. In 1830 he was elected one of the eight associates of the Academy of Sciences in the room of , Sir Humphry Davy","Dalton, Paris, London","US,FR,GB,UK",8,"United States,France,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,Europe,N/A"
"(628.) In 1833, at the age of sixty-seven, he received a tgjf charac' pension from government, up to which time he had maintained himself in the way already mentioned, with the utmost simplicity and contentment. Even in his lifetime it was impossible for his eulogists to forbear from some reference to this essential part of his really philosophic character. “ Mr Dalton has been labouring,” says Sir Humphry Davy, “ for more than a quarter of a century with the most dis¬ interested views. With the greatest modesty and simplicity of character, he has remained in the ob¬ scurity of the country, neither asking for approba¬ tion, nor offering himself as an object of applause.” “ There is little doubt,” says Dr Thomson, “ that Mr Dalton, had he so chosen it, might, in point of pecuniary circumstances, have exhibited a much more brilliant figure. But he has displayed a much more noble mind by the career which he has chosen ; equally regardless of riches as the most celebrated sages of antiquity, and as much respected and be¬ loved by his friends, even in the rich commercial town of Manchester, as if he were one of the greatest and most influential men in the country.” All who had the good fortune to know him personally—to see him, as the writer of these pages has done, in his modest school-room, and surrounded by his unpre¬ tending apparatus—will own that these eulogies are and death, not overdrawn. His latter days were spent in cheer¬ fulness and comfort; he expired on 27th July 1844, having nearly completed his seventy-eighth year",Manchester,US,8,United States,North America
"(629.) The philosophical character of Dalton may be Dalton’s briefly summed up. He had immense vigour of con- cai charac- ception, and an ardent love of truth. . He was tho- ter. roughly devoted to the pursuit of science during his long career, and he evidently sought and expected no higher reward than the insight which he obtained into the laws of nature. His mind, like his frame, was of a strongly masculine character, and happily exempt from nervous sensibility and other like in¬ firmities of genius. Whilst he held his own opinions with tenacity, and criticised freely those of his op¬ ponents, there is not a trace of acrimony in any of his writings ; and he always spoke in terms of high respect both of those who pursued science in a similar direction with himself, and (what was more difficult) likewise of those who, having the good for¬ tune to hold more conspicuous positions, showed him the smallest degree of kindness, which he always gratefully acknowledged. He was unlike Black and Cavendish, in the rapidity with which he seized on a few isolated facts, and made them the basis of an inference of great generality; this, indeed, was his leading characteristic; and he differed from them equally in the boldness with which he claimed from the public a general acceptance of his conclusions","Dalton, Dalton",US,8,United States,North America
"Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, an eminent French ^ chemist and physicist, contemporary with Dalton, Gay-Lus- has been mentioned in the course of the present sec- sac—che tion, as having discovered independently the equal ""l181 af^ dilatation of the gases, and also a law of their com- ^ binations in connection with their volumes, which was peculiar to himself. Besides these researches, science owes many useful observations in physics to his energy and talent, which, in the origin of his career, promised more of originality than his ma- turer life perfectly fulfilled. He was born in the old province of Limousin in 1778, and became the pupil of Berthollet in chemical researches, and was one of the earliest and most active members of the Societe d’Arceuil. In physics, he was the collaborator of MM. Biot, Humboldt, and Laplace. With the first Remark- of these philosophers he made his earliest experi- able bal- ment in aerostation, which he repeated alone on theloon ascent- 16th September 1804, when he attained the amaz¬ ing height of 7016 metres (23,019 English feet), an elevation previously unattained, and which in the course of the succeeding half century has only twice been touched, or exceeded by a small quantity.2 3 Con- 1 So stated by Dalton himself by Dr Henry, p. 163) ; but I suspect some misapprehension.

At length, about 1845, Mr Joule of Manchester en- Subject re- flavoured to establish a rigorous connection between Mr Joule. tlie mechanical effort expended and the heat gene- Mechanical rated by friction; and he appears to have satisfac- effect of torily established {Phil. Trans., 1850) that in the heat* case of water agitated by beaters, the work expended by the fall of 772 pounds through 1 foot is capable of raising the temperature of a pound of water by 1° of Fahrenheit.1 Mr Joule’s experiments and inferences, however, go much farther than this, namely, that in all circumstances where heat is generated, it is at the expense of a precisely similar equivalent of me¬ chanical effect; and conversely, that mechanical effect is never used up, without a corresponding evolution of heat, and that this is the case whatever be the fluids or other substances employed. Thus in the steam-engine the possible efficiency of the engine is only limited by the mechanical effort due to the heat given out by the condensed steam. So the heat given out by compressed air represents the force expended in compression; and even the heat produced by voltaic or magnetic electricity is that which corresponds to the work it might do. A step farther leads to the equivalence of heating effects by chemical combina¬ tion to the amount of energy which, differently di¬ rected, might have been realized in the shape of work; and though a larger induction is still required to justify all the conclusions which the zealous pro¬ mulgators of this comparatively new “ mechanical theory of heat” have advanced, it cannot be doubted that there is a basis of important truth in the matter which well deserves farther enquiry",Manchester,US,8,United States,North America

With or without companions he visited, in the early period of his career, America, and most of the northern countries of Europe, particularly Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway. He also medi¬ tated a journey to Egypt and the East, a project reluctantly abandoned, and to which he reverted even in the last years of his life ; but it was never carried into effect. Nothing, perhaps, fosters so surely a taste for science as such extended tours ; and the acquaintance made under the most agreeable cir¬ cumstances with foreign philosophers, and the fami¬ liarity gained with their language and experiments, contributes to it in no small degree",Holland,"DE,CH,SE,NO,EG,US",8,"Germany,Switzerland,Sweden,Norway,Egypt,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Africa,North America"
"We have now come to the period of Mr Leslie’s life when his character and position became esta¬ blished, the first by the publication of his Experi¬ mental Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of Heat, in 1804; the latter by his appointment to the chair of mathematics in the University of Edinburgh in 1805. I shall first say a few words on his cha¬ racter as a mathematician","University, Edinburgh","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"Nevertheless, his real preference appears to have been decidedly geometric. He almost always pre¬ fers demonstrations, whether in mathematics or na¬ tural philosophy, in the manner of Huygens and Newton. He could hardly be called a discoverer in mathematics; but his work on Geometrical Analysis and the Higher Curves shows much taste and know¬ ledge, and is justly commended by Chasles and other foreign writers. His attempt to replace Euclid’s Ele¬ ments by a new work on Elementary Geometry was not more successful than such attempts have usually been","Newton, Euclid",US,8,United States,North America
"Geneva was at this time nearly in the zenith of its (648.) reputation as a nursery of the sciences. The most ^lctet of l ^ .

About 1790 He Saussure, the most eminent physical geographer of his time, was in the vigour of his intellect, and amongst his friends and coadjutors Marc-Auguste Pictet held a conspicuous place. The latter was professor in the Academy, and being a person of popular man¬ ners and great information, was known and esteemed by the learned throughout Europe. He was the author of numberless papers in a scientific jour¬ nal which he edited ; but his work on fire—Essai sur le Feu—published in 1791, was his principal pub¬ lication. It contains some good observations on latent and specific heat; and on the power of different kinds 944 MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE",Geneva,US,8,United States,North America
"In such sciences as those which he chiefly culti¬ vated,— sciences eminently progressive, imperfect, and dependent on experimental proof,—a just appre¬ ciation of the labours of others is one of the most essential parts of the philosophic character, whilst an absence of it infallibly condemns the dogmatic theorist to be gradually left behind, even in the paths which he had at first trod with the greatest distinc¬ tion. With few exceptions, Sir J. Leslie carried his scientific views of 1804 with him to the grave. The possibility of the passing of heat, except solar and highly luminous heat, through any solid body, such as glass, though proved by Maycock, De la Roche, and Powell,—the existence of dark heating rays in the sunbeam, less refrangible than the red, demonstrated by Herschel, and afterwards confirmed by many others,—the doctrine of gases and vapours as laid down by Dalton,—the maximum density point of water shown so ably by Hope and Rumford,—the existence of climates in the arctic regions of which the mean annual temperature does not exceed 0° of Fahrenheit, proved by Parry and his successors,— all these, and many other demonstrated truths in his own peculiar walk of science, were, we fear, practi¬ cally ignored by him throughout life. (659.) But we willingly leave the ungrateful task of indi- Merit ofhis eating defects. Let us recollect rather with pleasure taiPreimeU* how much we owe to his beautiful discoveries. It is searches, perhaps not an insignificant test of their originality, that though they were generally adopted (at least to the extent which his own experiments justified), Les¬ lie’s observations were but rarely repeated, and that only in the way of general confirmation and illustra¬ tion. I mean that for a great many years the path which he had opened, and the methods which he de¬ scribed, were not seized upon by others, as leading to a sure course of discovery. Until the time of Dulong, his experiments on cooling were perhaps never care¬ fully resumed, and a very great number of his sub¬ jects of enquiry were only taken up thirty years after their publication, as we shall see in a future section",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

The manuscript, after lying for twelve years in the archives of the Institute, where it was consulted by different persons, was finally printed, word forward, as it stood in 1812.1 Fourier’s long absence from Paris in a remote provincial town, rendered this in¬ dignity possible at first; and afterwards, it was his misfortune to be unable to hold a political station without offence, amidst the violent intestine conflicts with which France was afflicted. He alternately dis¬ pleased his old master Napoleon and the Bourbons, and the consequence was, that after the Restoration he found himself dispossessed of every employment, master of not one thousand pounds, and refused by the government even a seat at the Institute. This indigence, so honourable to himself, and this neglect, so disgraceful to others, tended, no doubt, to increase an irritability, such as intense mental exertion often produces, and which the injustice of his scientific countrymen had already aggravated. Finally, how¬ ever, he received a modest post connected with the civil administration of the department of the Seine; he was also elected a member of the physical section of the Academy of Sciences, and he finally became perpetual secretary of that body",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

Martine, and par- cooling* ticularly De la Roche, had indeed thrown doubt on the subject, and had rendered it probable that at high temperatures the velocity of cooling (which is propor¬ tional to the radiant energy) is considerably greater than Newton’s law supposes. Dulong and Petit, however, first demonstrated this. They disengaged the experiment as far as possible from the influence of the contact of air, by using the most perfect ex¬ haustion which the best air-pumps could produce; and it appeared very plainly from the result of ob¬ servations made under successive degrees of rarefac¬ tion, that instead of there being the slightest appear¬ ance of radiation ceasing to take place when the vehicle 1 See Second Report on Meteorology, Brit.

They included the very delicate and difficult subject of the laws of the thermal expansion of bodies, particularly that of air and of mercury, which were applied to the theory of the thermometer, the very basis of all exact knowledge in the doctrine of heat. Another referred to the specific heat of the Specific gases, an enquiry of the very greatest difficulty, in heat of which we still find physicists disagreed. Dulonggdbes' bethought himself of using Laplace’s celebrated cor¬ rection for the velocity of sound due to the heat de¬ veloped during the compression of an elastic medium (art. 433), and proposed to deduce the heat thus developed, by a comparison of the observed and theo¬ retical (Newtonian) velocity of sound, and thence to obtain the specific heat. The theoretical velocity is easily obtained from the density of a gas under a given pressure: the observed velocity was ingeni¬ ously found by sounding one and the same organ pipe with the different gases in succession, and ascer¬ taining the pitch by the aid of Cagniard de Latour’s Sirene.

This he proved by ascertaining the proportion of heat absorbed by a black relatively to a ivhite surface. This proportion was invariably increased by the interposition of glass.

"Macedonio Melloni, a native of Parma in Italy, became associated as an experimenter, probably about the year 1828 or 1829, with Nobili, a skilful and ingenious physicist of Reggio (Modena).

"From 1831, this enquiry was conducted nearly (711.) exclusively by Melloni, who about that time settled Melloni first in Geneva and then in Paris, having been com- (llseoveis pelled, on political grounds, to quit Italy. His first derful and most important original memoir was presented trans- to the Academy of Sciences early in 1833, and was rodTsaU^ received with marked coldness, if not incredulity, by for heat, that body. A few months later, the writer of these pages had an opportunity of seeing Melloni’s ex¬ periments in Paris, and he made known their im¬ portance at the immediately succeeding meeting of the British Association at Cambridge. The Royal Society of London in no long time awarded their Rumford medal to Melloni, after which mark of foreign approbation, he first obtained a hearing from the Institute of France. The most consider¬ able result at which he had then arrived was this : that rock-salt possesses a power unapproached by any other substance of transmitting heat of any temperature and from whatever source, with ex¬ tremely little loss ; and as a natural consequence of this, that heat wholly devoid of luminosity, such as that from boiling water, or even the heat of the hand, may be refracted by prisms and lenses of rock-salt exactly in the same manner as light is refracted by glass. The reality of these effects (which had excited the persevering scepticism of the Parisian Savons') was demonstrated by a great number of most inge¬ nious experiments, in which every possible source of error and confusion was avoided or allowed for","Geneva, Paris, Paris, Cambridge, London","US,IT,FR,GB",8,"United States,Italy,France,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"The working out of this beautiful enquiry is entirely due to Melloni; and he has published a separate work on the “ Coloration of Heat.”1 He also rendered it probable that the rays most easily absorbed by glass and bodies generally are the least refrangible; and this has been made certain by direct experiments by the author of this Dissertation, who, by a peculiar me¬ thod, founded on the Total Reflection of heat within a prism of rock-salt, has obtained the following In¬ dices of Refraction:— (715.)

"(740.) Volta was the first among philosophers whose Volta. career lay solely in the study of electricity. Franklin and iEpinus, Beccaria and Wilke, Cavendish and Coulomb, gave it only a share oftheir attention ; but Volta was from boyhood exclusively an electrician",Franklin,US,8,United States,North America
"Volta substituted for this the flame of a lamp pro¬ ducing a heated current of air, which has a won¬ derful power of drawing off electricity; and he sug¬ gested the employment of large fires during thunder¬ storms in preference to metallic conductors. Volta hesitates not to ascribe to the worshippers of Jupiter Tonans the secret intention to draw off the electricity of heaven by the action of the flames on the altar.1 Arago has ingeniously suggested that a statistical enquiry as to the frequency of thunderstorms in the neighbourhood of extensive iron-smelting furnaces might test the value of this safeguard. The straw electrometer which Volta connected with his appara¬ tus was capable (by a gradation of instruments of greater or less delicacy) of measuring numerically the force of charges from 1000 to 2000 units",Jupiter,US,8,United States,North America
"That the chief source of atmospheric electricity is (744.) evaporation appears first to have occurred to Volta, Due^eva' and to have been first demonstrated by experiments made either with him or by his suggestion, at Paris in 1780, by Lavoisier and Laplace. The history is given by Volta himself in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1782. When water is thrown upon an insulated heated body so that evaporation takes place, or when hot coals are thrown into an insulated vessel of water, the hot body is usually found to be electrified negatively. Volta has very candidly stated the inversions of effect which occasionally occur, and which still throw some doubt upon the precise signi¬ ficance of this very important experiment. Later experimenters have thought that absolutely pure water developes no electricity: this, however, will not affect the validity of the explanation of the origin of atmospheric electricity. To prevent misappre¬ hension it may be observed that the astonishing de- velopement of electricity from high-pressure steam escaping through a small aperture, as lately observed by Mr Armstrong, appears, from the experiments of Dr Faraday, to depend on an entirely different cause","Paris, Laplace",US,8,United States,North America
"Nicholson, a good electrician and chemist, and Carlisle (afterwards Sir Anthony), a medical man, were the first in England to construct one of Volta’s piles. It consisted first of 17, afterwards of 36, half- crowns, with as many disks of zinc and of paste¬ board, soaked in salt water. Experimenting upon the electrical effects of the pile, they used a drop of water “ to make sure the contacts” upon the upper plate. Carlisle first observed a disengagement of gas round the wire which the water moistened","Carlisle, Carlisle",US,8,United States,North America
"Nicholson suspected it to be hydrogen, and pro¬ posed to break the circuit by enclosing water in a tube between the two wires. This was accordingly done on the 2d May 1800, within a month of the arrival in England of the first four pages of Volta’s letter to Sir J. Banks, which preceded the remainder by a considerable space of time. The brass wire in the water tube, which was connected with the posi¬ tive end of the pile, became tarnished and black, whilst minute bubbles of gas were evolved from the other, to the amount of ygth of a cubic inch in 21- hours. Being mixed with an equal quantity of com¬ mon air, and a lighted waxed thread being applied, it exploded. It was, therefore, concluded to be hy¬ drogen derived from the decomposition of the water, whose oxygen had combined with the brass of the positive wire.1 Nicholson, it appears, was well ac¬ quainted with Fabbroni’s writings on the relation of galvanism to chemical action ; and in the very paper where he describes Volta’s pile and his own discovery, he expresses his astonishment that Volta should have taken no notice of Fabbroni’s results, or of the rapid oxidation of zinc in contact with other metals which appears in the pile, and which had been no¬ ticed by Fabbroni in every case where two metals differing in oxidability are placed in water, and in contact with each other. The experiment was repeated at Vienna, and then by Volta himself, who called attention to an experiment by three Dutch chemists, Pacts, Van Troostwyk, and Dieman, who had decomposed water by common electricity in 1789",Vienna,"US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"
"Volta, himself, however, did not enter with zeal (755.) upon this new career ; he even left to others the Volta re- task of improving the form and increasing the energy ^nctkms8"" of his battery, which was first done by the useful from Na- arrangement of Cruickshank. He was now ap-poleon, and preaching his 60th year, and seems to have ^)een ^titute of not indisposed to pass an old age of ease, and to re- France— ceive in tranquillity the marks of distinction which were showered upon him. In 1801 Napoleon called him to Paris, attended the meeting of the Institute where Volta explained his theory of the pile, caused to be voted to him on the spot a gold medal, and sent him home with a valuable present in money",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"The pile of Volta was, in one sense, rather a means of discovery than a discovery itself. Volta had neither a just theory of the source of power which he invented, nor was he successful in applying it to any important research. The discovery of its chemical efficiency by Nicholson and Carlisle, stimu¬ lated, as we have seen, for a short time his interest and curiosity; but he never seriously attached him¬ self to this line of discovery. His subsequent papers are chiefly controversial, in support of the Contact theory. The generation, as well as the expendi¬ ture of chemical forces by the pile, consequently re¬ mained, as far as he was concerned, in complete obscurity",Carlisle,US,8,United States,North America
"967 and Electricity—was the subject of his earliest, and also that of his happiest essays. He was a very able chemist in the strictest sense of the word, although his ardour and his rapidity of generalizing might seem to unfit him, in some measure, for a pursuit which requires such intense watchfulness with regard to mi- nutbe, such patient weighings of fractions of a grain, such frequent though easy calculations. To Caven¬ dish and Dalton, his great contemporaries—to whom we may now add Wollaston—these things were a pleasure in themselves ; to Davy they must ever have been irksome indispensables to the discovery of truth",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

"His^first r^^ie earty PaPers °f Davy refer chiefly to Heat, papers, and Light, and Electricity. He was, in fact, a physicist experi- more than a chemist. Whilst yet a surgeon’s ap- ments on prentice at Penzance, he satisfied himself of the im- oxide. materiality of heat, which he illustrated by some in¬ genious experiments, in which, concurring unawares with the conclusions of his future patron Rumford, he laid one foundation of his promotion. Removed to a sphere of really scientific activity at Clifton, under Dr Beddoes,1 he executed those striking re¬ searches in pneumatic chemistry and the physiologi¬ cal effects of breathing various gases which gave him his first reputation; researches so arduous and full of risk as to require a chemist in the vigour of life, and urged by an unextinguishable thirst for dis¬ covery, to undertake them. Even his brilliant dis¬ covery of the effects of inhaling nitrous oxide brought no competitor into the field; and the use of anses- thetics, which might naturally have followed—the greatest discovery (if we except, perhaps, that of vaccination) for the relief of suffering humanity made in any age—was delayed for another generation","Penzance, Clifton","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"rests. Promoted in 1801 to a situation in the Labo- stitution— ratory of the Royal Institution in London, he attached exPeri- himself to the study of galvanism in the interval of^”^^,011 the other and more purely chemical pursuits which electricity, the duties of his situation required. He had already, at Clifton, made experiments with the pile of Volta, and taken part in the discussion of its theory and effects, then (as we have seen) so actively carried on in Britain. In his papers of that period we find not only excellent experiments, but happy and just rea¬ soning. The chemical theory of the pile—namely, that the electrical effects observed by Galvani and Volta are due solely or chiefly to the chemical ac¬ tion of the fluid element on the metals—was more strongly embraced by him then than afterwards. In November 1800 he concluded that “ the pile of Volta acts only when the conducting substance be¬ tween the plates is capable of oxidating the zinc ; and that in proportion as a greater quantity of oxy¬ gen enters into combination with the zinc in a given time, so in proportion is the power of the pile to de¬ compose water and to give the shock greater.” He concludes that “ the chemical changes connected with” oxidation “ are somehow the cause of the elec¬ trical effect it produces.”2 His views on this sub¬ ject underwent some modification afterwards. In his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, pub! i sh ed twelve years later, we find the following statement of his opinions on the subject:—“ Electrical effects are exhi¬ bited by the same bodies acting as masses, which produce chemical phenomena when acting by their particles ; it is, therefore, not improbable that the primary cause of both may be the same.” A little further on he adds :—“ They,” speaking of electrical and chemical energies, “ are conceived to be dis¬ tinct phenomena, but produced by the same power acting in the one case on masses, in the other on par¬ ticles.”3 1 Davy hit off his principal’s character in a single sentence,—“ Beddoes had talents which would have exalted him to the pin¬ nacle of philosophical eminence, if they had been applied with discretion.’ 2 Works, ii., 162","London, Clifton","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"porary, Dr Thomas Young (than whom no man was ever a less indiscriminate eulogist), that Davy’s researches were “ more splendidly successful than any which have ever before illustrated the physical sciences, in any of their departments and that the contents of the Bakerian Lectures, in particular, “ are as much superior to those of Newton’s Optics, as the Principia are superior to these or any other human work.” 2 A not less impartial tribute to his superla¬ tive genius has been yielded by M. Dumas, who, if I mistake not, has described Davy as being the ablest and most successful chemist who ever lived. A si¬ milar homage is paid to him by the sagacious Cuvier","Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"3 Jons Jacob Berzelius, the greatest analytical chemist of his day, was born in East Gothland, in the same year with Davy, and died in 1848, when he had almost completed his 69th year. He contributed, in a signal manner, to the establishment of Dalton’s principle of definite chemical equivalents ; but he made no single discovery of commanding importance",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"be incapable of causing explosion. The former of these modes of protection, it was soon seen, could only be palliative; the only efficient form which it took, was that of a more effectual ventilation ; but the ter¬ rific rapidity with which a mine may be suddenly in¬ vaded by fire-damp, from channels opened by a single blow of the pickaxe, must prevent it from ever act¬ ing as a cure. The latter plan had as yet yielded nothing more effectual than the steel mill long used by miners, which produced an uncertain and inter¬ mitting light, by the rotation of a steel wheel against a flint, the scintillations of which were incapable of inflaming the fire-damp. The insufficiency of the light prevented it from being used, except in circum¬ stances of known danger. The celebrated Baron Humboldt, Dr Clanny, and several others, had in¬ vented safety-lamps on different principles ; but they were all clumsy and more or less ineffectual.1 At last, in the summer of 1815, the Rev. Dr Gray (afterwards Bishop of Bristol), then chair¬ man of a committee appointed by a benevolent as¬ sociation at Bishop Wearmouth for the prevention of colliery accidents, applied to Davy, who was then on a sporting tour in Scotland, requesting his advice and assistance. Sir Humphry answered the call with promptitude. On his southward journey, in the latter part of August, he visited the collieries, ascer¬ tained the circumstances of the danger which he had to meet, and was provided by Mr Buddie with speci¬ mens of the inflammable air for examination. Within a fortnight after his return to London, he had ascer¬ tained new and important qualities of the substance, and had already four schemes on hand for the pre¬ vention of accident. Before the end of October, he had arrived at the following principles of operation in connection with a safety-lamp. “ First, A certain mixture of azote and carbonic acid prevents the ex¬ plosion of the fire-damp, and this mixture is neces¬ sarily formed in the safe-lantern ; secondly, The fire¬ damp will not explode in tubes or feeders of a certain small diameter. The ingress to, and egress of air from my lantern,” he adds, “ is through such tubes or feed¬ ers ; and, therefore, when an explosion is artificially made in the safe lantern, it does not communicate to the external air.” The effect of narrow tubes in inter¬ cepting the passage of flame, is due to the cooling effect of their metallic sides upon the combustible gases of which flame is composed ;2 * and one of his first and most important observations was the fortunate pecu¬ liarity that fire-damp, even when mixed with the amount of air most favourable to combustion (1 part of gas to 7 or 8 of air), requires an unusually high temperature to induce combination. Olefiant gas, carbonic oxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen, are all in¬ flamed by iron at a red heat, or ignited charcoal, but carburetted hydrogen does not take fire under a per¬ fect white heat. The earliest safety-lamp consisted of a lantern with horn or glass sides, in which a current of air to supply the flame was admitted below by numerous tubes of small diameter, or by narrow in¬ terstices between concentric tubes of some length ; or, finally, by rows of parallel partitions of metal, form¬ ing rectangular canals extremely narrow in propor¬ tion to their length. A similar system of escape apertures was applied at the top of the lantern","Bristol, London","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"Davy was elected President of the Royal Society (777.) in 1820, in the room of Sir Joseph Banks, who had held the office for 42 years. It wras a distinguished 0f compliment, for the election was all but unanimous. Royal So- He continued to communicate papers for several his years subsequently ; but his energy, his temper, and, finally, his health began to give way—showing that the ardent labours of his youth and prime had in¬ jured his constitution.

"The strong points of his character were precision (784.) and rare acuteness in observation, patience and cau- raster con- tion in deduction, and habitual devotion of his time trasted and energies to scientific pursuits. His foibles wrere with that an excess of caution, and a certain microscopic turn of Davy- of mind which, though it sometimes rewarded him with valuable discoveries, consumed his time in oc¬ cupations of mechanical ingenuity, and prevented him from grappling with almost any of the great theories of his day. An exception, yet one which illustrates his character, may be found in the fact that he had all but anticipated Dalton in his disco¬ very of the multiple combinations of salts, whilst, with his characteristic sense of justice, he disclaimed any participation in the merit (624). While Davy was de¬ lighting crowded audiences with his eloquence, his discoveries, and their wonderful results, Wollaston was pursuing his solitary experiments on a scale so small that scarcely three persons could witness them at once. While Davy was firing his potassium with ice, and making mimic volcanos heave by the oxida¬ tion of his new metals, Wollaston was extract¬ ing, by minute analyses, from the refractory and unoxidable ores of platinum, substances previously undetected, which, neither by their quantity nor their characters, could ever interest any but a man of science. While Davy was charging his prodi¬ gious battery of 2000 pairs,—the largest which has ever been constructed (a homage to his ge¬ nius, provided by his numerous admirers),—Wol¬ laston was proving, after his fashion, how similar effects could be produced by the very same agency on a small scale ; and with no greater apparatus than a shred of zinc, a few drops of acid, and an old thimble, he would gratify his friends by exhibiting the mimic glow of an almost microscopic wire of platinum",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America
"(788 ) aSe 20- Oersted, whilst yet a student at His early the University of Copenhagen, became an author, studies. His first publication was a prize essay on an sesthe- tical subject. Being intended for the medical pro¬ fession, he soon after wrote some chemical papers, and, in 1801, his first “ On Galvanic Electricity.” But his turn of mind at this time, as well as later, was of a strongly metaphysical cast, and of course tinctured with the peculiarities of the German school as regards the study of physics, of which the title of his thesis on graduation may be given as an instance :—It was On the Architectonicks of Natural Metaphysics. His studies in voltaic elec¬ tricity were made chiefly under Ritter, an obscure and mystical writer, though the author of some cu¬ rious experiments on what were called Secondary Piles ; and he at length obtained, in 1806, a pro¬ fessorship in his own university ; but his associates appear to have been rather literary than scientific persons, such as Steffens, Oehlenschlager, Niebuhr, and Fichte ; he also engaged in controversies of a theological tendency, which, to the end of his life, appear to have had a great attraction for him","University, Copenhagen","US,DK,DE",8,"United States,Denmark,Germany","North America,Europe,Europe"
"974 nal, Oersted took no immediate measures either to complete or to publish his discovery. Some months appear to have elapsed whilst waiting for the conve¬ nience of a larger battery before he repeated the ex¬ periment with the aid of Professor Esmark and other friends. The battery then employed contained 20 twelve-inch elements, charged with water and ^th of mixed nitric and sulphuric acids. The conducting wire was heated red hot, which must have rather dimi¬ nished the effect than otherwise. The nature of the wire was found to be unimportant. If positive electri¬ city passed from north to south through a conducting wire placed horizontally in the magnetic meridian, then a compass needle suspended over it had its north end deviated to the west; if under it, to the east; if the needle was placed on the east side of the conduc¬ tor, its north end was raised ; if on the west side, it was depressed. Oersted further found that needles of non-magnetic substances, such as brass and gum- lac, were not affected, and that the electrical efficiency depended on the quantity, not the intensity, of the current. These experiments seem to have been made in July 1820 ; and Oersted and his friends being now fully alive to the novelty and importance of the dis¬ covery,he circulated extensively copies of a Latin tract, dated the 21st July,in which the effects of the “electric conflict,” as he terms the presumed combination of the opposite electricities in the “ conjunctive wire” upon a magnet, were described.1 In this tract we find the following expressions :—“ The electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.” “ It resembles a helix.” “ The electric conflict is not confined to the conduct¬ ing wire, but it has around it a sphere of activity of considerable extent.” (792.) The effect of this pamphlet, consisting of a few Speedily pages only, was instantaneous and wonderful. The talcen up auth0r probably counted on the opportunity of devel- pLe,m oping his discovery at leisure, but it was seized on Arago, and with such avidity, and pursued with such signal suc- ^avy- cess, particularly in France, that he probably gave up the race of invention in despair. Ampere had already communicated experiments to the Institute on the 18th and 26 th September. Arago and Davy sepa¬ rately, and but little later, discovered the magnetiz¬ ing power which the voltaic conductor exerted on iron filings, and the latter tried in vain the magnetizing power of common or machine electricity, which, how¬ ever, was soon after shown by Arago, who enclosed steel wires in helices of copper wire, through which the discharges were passed. When soft iron was placed in such a helix, it was found to become a tem¬ porary magnet of great power whilst the voltaic cummt continued. Thus magnets of enormously greater power than any previously known were con¬ structed ; one of the first large ones was made by Pro¬ fessor Henry of the United States",,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"(793.) Bed the progress of electro-magnetismas a science was far more indebted to Ampere, a professor at Paris, than to any other philosopher. I shall, therefore, introduce here some account of his dis¬ coveries before closing what I have to say of Oer¬ sted",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"Andre Marie Ampere was born in 1775 at Lyon. (794.) He was an able mathematician, and wrote several Electro¬ memoirs on Chances, and on the Integration of Par- ^oryof tial Differential Equations. But with this he com- Ampere, bined a taste for, and a practical acquaintance with, the experimental sciences. He was a very good che¬ mist, and showed himself particularly attentive to Davy on his first visit to Paris. He was also much attached to metaphysical speculation. His skill in devising apparatus and in performing experiments was eminently shown in his electro-magnetic researches ; whilst he judiciously rendered his mathematical knowledge subservient to them. In this respect he had greatly the advantage of Oersted, who appears to have been little acquainted with mathematics, and, perhaps, in common with his metaphysical friends of the German school, misapprehended their utility in physical discoveries. Three different hypotheses Various were speedily broached to represent mechanically °Pinion8 the singular kind of force mutually exerted between Mature a conductor and a magnet. The first and most ob- 0f the elec- vious was, that this action was not a ■push-and-pulltro-m&g- force, but a force producing rotation without directnetic force• attraction and repulsion, or of the nature of a couple exerted between any part of an electric current, and a small magnet or magnetic element. The second opinion was, that an electric current may be esteemed equivalent to a magnetizing force at right angles to it. The third, that a magnet is composed of ele¬ ments which act as if a closed electric circuit ex¬ isted independently within each of them ; that is, each magnetic molecule may be replaced by a small conducting wire bent upon itself, in which some un¬ failing source of electricity, like a galvanic pair, keeps up, in the same direction, a constant current","Lyon, Paris","FR,US,DE",8,"France,United States,Germany","Europe,North America,Europe"
"This last hypothesis, arbitrary and improbable as (795.) it may sound, was that defended by Ampere. Whilst Theory or few will be disposed to regard it as a true and com- Adopted by plete physical picture of the condition of magnetized Ampere, bodies, it seems impossible not to award to it the same sort of credit which we do to Newton’s “ fits of easy reflection and transmission” of light, when we find that it not only serves to represent the more obvious phenomena, but has suggested experiments absolutely new, and which turned out in accordance with the anticipation ; and that, finally, by the sagacity and industry of its author it was made to include, by merely mathematical deductions, and without any complication of the hypothesis, certain experiments of a very singular kind, which at first seemed inex¬ plicable by it. I proceed to develope a little farther this consideration",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"This rapid succession of interesting topics has pre- (799.) vented attention from being perhaps sufficiently di-Great rected to the importance of Ampere’s labours. jjemerit of is at least as well entitled as any other philosopher 'T6116' who has yet appeared, to be called “ the Newton of Electricity.” Ampere wras of an amiable, though rather eccentric (800.) character. His absence of mind w^as proverbial, andIIls death his style is somewhat cumbrous and obscure. But he wTas devoted to science, the promotion of which was ever his first consideration, and he evidently himself possessed great clearness in his conceptions",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"(801.) Whilst Ampere, Arago, Davy, the two De la Seebeck. Rivegj and Mr Faraday, were throwing light on ofthermo- the causes, and developing the consequences of electricity. Oersted’s experiment, Seebeck of Berlin discovered in 1822 a new source of electric excitement, which has since become indirectly of very great im¬ portance. This was Thermo-Electricity. He found that when heterogeneous metals are united, either by soldering or pressure, and the junction heated, a current of electricity is established. The order of metals which produces the most energetic combina¬ tions, is wholly unlike the arrangement of the vol¬ taic series, and has no apparent reference to any other known property of those substances. Bismuth and antimony stand at the opposite extremities of the scale, and a pair formed of them is consequently the most powerful which can be made. When heat¬ ed at the junction, positive electricity passes from bismuth to antimony. In 1823, Oersted, then on a visit to Paris, united with Fourier in making expex-iments on this subject, and was probably the first who constructed thermo-electrical piles. Un¬ questionably, the most important application of these was to the construction of an instrument for measur¬ ing the effects of radiant heat, by Nobili and Melloni, of which an account has already been given, Art","Paris, Un","US,IN",8,"United States,India","North America,Asia"
"Though Oersted was the author of numerous (804.) papers connected with science down nearly to His experi- the close of his life, they do not contain any impor- ments on tant discovery, and with reference to electro-mag- passion 0f netism, he appears to have contented himself princi- water, pally with repeating and expounding the observations of his contemporaries. But some of his experiments on other subjects deserve mention, especially those on the compressibility of water. This fact, which the Flo¬ rentine Academicians had vainly sought to establish in the 17th century, had been clearly demonstrated by Canton in the middle of the 18th, but Oersted first devised a compendious and effective apparatus for producing and measuring it more effectually. His result, that the compression amounts to 46-millionths of the bulk, for a pressure equal to one atmosphere, agrees almost precisely with Canton’s. In 1845, he considered that he had established that the heat de¬ veloped by the same amount of compression is ‘0203 of a centigrade degree. He also made some experi¬ ments on the Law of the Compressibility of Air and upon other subjects","Canton, Canton",US,8,United States,North America

This eminent philosopher was born, I believe, in hlstor^a/nd -l^e was originally “ a bookseller’s apprentice, connection —ver7 fond of experiment and very averse to trade.” with Davy In 1812 he sent to 'Sir H. Davy, then at the height and the^ of his reputation, a copy of a set of notes taken at his stitution” loci'111,68* desiring his assistance “ to escape from trade, and enter into the service of science.” To the credit of the popular and distinguished chemist, he gave Mr Faraday a courteous answer, and appointed him as chemical assistant in the Laboratory of the Royal In¬ stitution in March 1813. Leaving England to travel in the autumn of the same year, Davy engaged Mr Faraday to accompany him as secretary and scien¬ tific assistant; they returned in April 1815, and from that time to the present Mr Faraday has been constantly engaged in the scientific business of the Royal Institution, which is as completely associated with his numerous and splendid dis¬ coveries as Cambridge is with those of Newton, and Slough with those of the elder Herschel. By a rare, perhaps unexampled good fortune, that esta¬ blishment, founded principally for the promotion of original research and the promulgation of dis¬ coveries, has been indebted during the first fifty years of its existence to the talents of two men only, for a succession of new scientific truths which might have done credit to a whole academy; indeed, if to the names of Davy and Mr Faraday we add that of Young, who here first promulgated the doc¬ trines of the Interference of Light, there is scarcely an academy in Europe which has within the same period added so extensively to our choicest stock of original science","March, Cambridge, Newton, Slough, Young","GB,US,UY",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay","Europe,North America,South America"
"I 'With regard to electro-chemical decomposition and the theory of the pile, the great extent and intri¬ cacy of the subject require us to restrict our analysis to a few of the leading conclusions. The most im¬ portant of these may be summed up in the following propositions :—1st, The amount of a decomposable substance (or electrolyte) analysed into its elements by a current of electricity depends solely on the amount of electricity passing through it, and is in¬ dependent of the form of apparatus employed, the dimensions of the poles (or electrodes), the strength of the solution, or any other circumstance. It is thence inferred, with respect, for instance, to water, that the amount of it decomposed in a given time is an exact measure of the quantity of electricity set in motion in that time. 2<i, When a substance is thus decomposed, it is a necessary, or at least a highly probable, consequence of Dalton’s laws, that the elements separated are in atomic proportions to one another. But Mr Faraday also found that when several decompositions are effected at the same time by interposing different electrolytes in intervals of the same circuit, the whole of the series of elements separated bear the atomic relations to one another",Dalton,US,8,United States,North America

"Brugmans observed, in 1778, the repulsion of bis¬ muth by a magnet, which was rediscovered by Le¬ baillif in 1827 ; and something like the equatoreal pointing of shell-lac and wood was noticed in the same year by Becquerel, and may also be traced in the writings of Coulomb. The present writer recol¬ lects very distinctly to have had pointed out to him by M. Becquerel, at Paris, about 1835, the pointing of minute chips of wood placed near a common steel magnet. But these incidental facts having been suf¬ fered to remain in complete obscurity for so many years, without even an attempt to connect and ex¬ plain them, can scarcely be said even to touch the originality of Dr Faraday’s discovery",Paris,US,8,United States,North America
"This was the first accomplishment of telegraphic com¬ munication by means of electricity, and it realized the fancy of Strada, quoted by Addison, of sym¬ pathetic magnets.

"Setting all theory aside, it is an unquestionable fact, that if a telegraphic communication be made, sup¬ pose from London to Brighton, by means of a wire going thither, passing through a galvanometer, and then returning, the force of the current shown by the galvanometer at Brighton will be almost ex¬ actly doubled, if, instead of the return wire, we establish a good communication between the end of the conducting wire and the mass of the earth at Brighton. The whole resistance of the return wire is at once dispensed with ! This fact was more than suspected by the ingenious M. Steinheil in 1838; but, from some cause or other, it obtained little publicity; nor does the author appear to have ex¬ erted himself to remove the reasonable prejudices with which so singular a paradox was naturally re¬ ceived. A most ingenious artist, Mr Bain, estab¬ lished for himself the principle, and proclaimed its application somewhat later; and in 1843, perhaps the first entirely convincing experiments were made by M. Matteucci at Pisa. From this time the double wire required to move the needle telegraph was reduced to a single one. The explanation of this curious fact appears to be,—not that the electricity is conducted back by the earth to its origin at the battery,—but that the molecular disturbance po- larly communicated along the conducting wire to its farther end being effectually relieved by perfect com¬ munication with a vast reservoir of neutral electri¬ city like the earth, conduction proceeds in an unin¬ terrupted manner, and to an unlimited extent","London, Brighton, Brighton, Brighton, Pisa","US,GB,IT",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Italy","North America,Europe,Europe"

"for which may in each case be expanded into a series, the co-efficients of the terms of which (known as Laplace’s co-efficients) are connected by certain rela¬ tions which are evolved from the conditions of the problem. It was M. Biot first of all, but principally Poisson, who applied this method to electrical, and subsequently to magnetical phenomena. Poisson, with great labour, succeeded in representing correctly by analysis the conditions of some of Coulomb’s ex¬ periments on spheres and ellipsoids. But it must be owned that the complication of the analysis, the difficulty of applying it to any but the very simplest cases, and the considerable latitude of the errors of experiment, rendered the results rather analytical exercises than solid bases for physical induction ; which may in some degree account for the manner in which Sir John Leslie mentions them in his Dis¬ sertation. Poisson (as I have elsewhere remarked) had not the talent of conducting his mathematics in a fei'tile direction, and usually left the fields of ex¬ perimental physics on which he touched nearly as barren as he found them. But this is no rea¬ son why other mathematical reasoners may not obtain more pregnant results. We shall see in the next section that Gauss, a distinguished contempo¬ rary of Poisson, by treating the great problem of the distribution of the magnetism of the globe (in many respects similar to those of the theory of electricity) with the utmost mathematical gene¬ rality, has obtained results of great novelty and importance ; that he has not only shown experi¬ menters how to proceed, but has invented instru¬ ments for them to use.

"It is an undulating line inclined somewhere near 12° or 13° to the terrestrial equator, and cutting it in two points not exactly opposite, but in about 3° 20' and 174° 30' of east longitude from Paris, according to Admiral Duperrey’s observations in 1825. The position of these nodes is, however, variable. The north end of the needle (as is well known) dips more and more in the northern hemisphere, until in a certain place it becomes vertical, where there¬ fore the horizontal component of the magnetic force is nothing, and the common compass loses altogether its directive power. Similar phenomena occur in the southern hemisphere. Lines of dip of 10°, 20°, &c., may be drawn, and where the dip is 90° there is a true magnetic pole.

That the intensity of the earth’s directive force may be mea¬ sured by counting the oscillations of a suspended magnet in the same way that a pendulum measures gravity was known to Graham, Lambert, and others, towards the middle of the last century ; but the ex¬ ploration of its variation on the earth’s surface was first attempted by the officers of Laperouse in 1785, and later by De Rossel. But it was Baron Hum¬ boldt who, at the instigation of Borda,1 undertook the earliest observations which have had any perma¬ nent influence on this branch of science, and who in the first years of this century determined the rela- Baron tive intensity of the earth’s magnetism at Paris and Hum- at the magnetic equator in South America, to be in boldt’8 the ratio of 1’3482 to 1-0000; 2 * a result which has un^' become, so to speak, classical, and which the author considered as the most important result of his jour¬ ney.^ M. Hansteen promoted the same enquiry ex¬ tensively ; he devised a neat and convenient apparatus for counting the oscillations of the needles, and he investigated the effects of time and temperature in altering their magnetism.4 He made numerous ob¬ servations in the north of Europe, and finally under¬ took, between 1827 and 1829 (by the liberality of the Norwegian parliament or Storthing), an adven¬ turous journey into Siberia, for the purpose of exa¬ mining the “ region of convergence” of the needle in that quarter.

"His Theoria Motus Corporum Ccdestium, published in 1809, is a very remarkable treatise on the geome¬ trical theory of the planetary orbits; in which it was shown for the first time how the elliptic ele¬ ments of a heavenly body may be deduced from three observations only of longitude and latitude,— an important extension of Newton’s celebrated de¬ monstration in the case of parabolic cometary orbits",Newton,US,8,United States,North America
"To these instruments, Professor Lloyd, of Dublin, added another for measuring the vertical component of the magnetic intensity. It is a magnet suspended horizontally on knife-edges like those of a balance",Dublin,US,8,United States,North America
"He farther instituted an association (magnetischer Verein), composed at first almost entirely of Ger¬ mans, whose continuous observations on fixed Term- days extended from Holland to Sicily.* The marvel¬ lous coincidence of the occurrence of even the minute irregularities of the earth’s magnetism was thus more fully established",Holland,US,8,United States,North America
"Following up the methods employed by Laplace (905.) and others, for representing the attractions of aTheoren?8 sphere or spheroid, he proposes to discover the form attTaTtions",Laplace,US,8,United States,North America
"Although seconded by young, able, and enthusiastic officers of the service to which General Sabine be¬ longs, the difficulty of starting simultaneously sys¬ tematic observations (with instruments new and little understood, and dispersed to the widest possible ex¬ tent over the surface of the globe), was evidently very great. Canada, St Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen’s Land, were selected for primary stations ; and the vastly voluminous results of hourly or two-hourly observations of numerous instruments continued year by year came pouring in to the central establishment at Woolwich under General Sabine’s presidency. Besides these, several nautical expedi¬ tions were fitted out for similar purposes, the most important of which was sent in 1840 under the direc¬ tion of Sir James Clark Ross to approach as nearly Captain as might be to the Antarctic Pole. This voyage, whe- ^ ther in respect of the spirit of adventure displayed, the wonderful character of the natural objects re¬ vealed by it for the first time to human view, or the importance of the scientific results obtained, may rank with any of our memorable polar expeditions",,CA,8,Canada,North America
"In Europe national, and even private, observa¬ tories have contributed largely to our knowledge of the laws of magnetism. Among these observatories may be mentioned Greenwich, Dublin, Makerstoun in Scotland, Munich, Prague, Brussels, St Peters-^ burg, and the numerous other Russian stations. At Greenwich and at Kew, near London, the automatic registration of magnetical and meteorological instru¬ ments, by means of photography, was introduced by Mr Brooke and Mr Ronalds. It would be impossi¬ ble in this place to give even a summary of the re¬ sults obtained from these and the Colonial estab¬ lishments. Besides the valuable deductions by General Sabine already referred to (910), the careful analysis of the formal laws of magnetism obtained at their respective observatories byM.Lamont, M.Kreil, and Mr Broun (Sir Thomas M. Brisbane’s observer), merit special notice","Dublin, Munich, Prague, Brussels, London, Lamont, Brisbane","US,DE,CZ,BE,GB,AU,RU",8,"United States,Germany,Czechia,Belgium,United Kingdom,Australia,Russian Federation","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Oceania,Europe"
