"1 I have ventured here to combine a scriptural expression with an allusion of Plato’s to a Grecian game;—an allusion which, in his writings, is finely and pathetically applied to the rapid succession of generations, through which the continuity of human life is maintained from age to age; and which are perpetually transferring from hand to hand the concerns and du¬ ties of this fleeting scene, revvaim; T£ xa) ixrgsQovns ‘raT'Sas, xa.6a‘jrtt> tou [iiov oraga'didovrii aXXoi; aXXaiv.—(Plato, Leg","Plato, Plato",CO,8,Colombia,South America
"3 It is observed by Dr Cudworth, that the doctrine which refers the origin of moral distinctions to the arbitrary ap¬ pointment of the Deity, was strongly reprobated by the ancient fathers of the Christian church, and that “ it crept up afterward in the scholastic ages; Occam being among the first that maintained that there is no act evil, hut as it is prohi¬ bited by God, and which cannot he made good, if it be commanded by him. In this doctrine he was quickly followed by Petrus Alliacus, Andreas de Novo Castro, and others.”—See Treatise of Immutable Morality",Castro,CL,8,Chile,South America
"Not that Italy was then destitute of writers who pretended to the character of philosophers; hut as their attempts were, in general, limited to the exclusive illustration and defence of some one or other of the ancient systems for which they had conceived a predilection, they added but little of their own to the stock of useful know¬ ledge, and are now remembered chiefly from the occasional recurrence of their names in the catalogues of the curious, or in the works of philological erudition. The zeal of Cardinal Bessarion, and of Marsilius Ficinus, for the re¬ vival of the Platonic philosophy, was more pe¬ culiarly remarkable, and, at one time, produced so general an impression, as to alarm the follow¬ ers of Aristotle for the tottering authority of their master. If we may credit Launoius, this great revolution was on the point of being ac¬ tually accomplished, when Cardinal Bellarmine warned Pope Clement VIII. of the peculiar dan¬ ger of showing any favour to a philosopher whose opinions approached so nearly as those of Plato to the truths revealed in the Gospel",Plato,"IT,CO",8,"Italy,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"In reading La Rochefoucauld, it should ne¬ ver be forgotten, that it was within the vortex of a court he enjoyed his chief opportunities of studying the world; and that the narrow and exclusive circle in which he moved was not likely to afford him the most favourable speci¬ mens of human nature in general. Of the Court of Lewis XIV. in particular, we are told by a very nice and reflecting observer (Madame de la Fayette), that C£ ambition and gallantry were the soul, actuating alike both men and wo¬ men. So many contending interests, so many different cabals were constantly at work, and in all of these, women bore so important a part, that love was always mingled with business, and business with love. Nobody was tranquil or in¬ different. Every one studied to advance him¬ self by pleasing, serving, or ruining others. Idle¬ ness and languor were unknown, and nothing was thought of but intrigues or pleasures.” In the passage already quoted from Voltaire, he takes notice of the effect of La Rochefou¬ cauld’s Maxims, in improving the style of French composition. We may add to this remark, that their effect has not been less sensible in vitiating the tone and character of French philosophy, by bringing into vogue those false and degrading representations of human nature and of human life, which have prevailed in that country, more or less, for a century past. Mr Addison, in one of the papers of the Taller, expresses his in¬ dignation at this general bias among the French writers of his age. “ It is impossible,” he ob¬ serves, “ to read a passage in Plato or Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without being a greater and better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modish French authors, or those of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that nation, without being, for some time, out of humour with myself, and at everything about me. Their business is to depreciate human nature, and to consider it under the worst appearances; they give mean interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions. In short, they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man, or between the species of man and that of the brutes.”1 It is very remarkable, that the censure here bestowed by Addison on the fashionable French wits of his time should be so strictly applicable to Helvetius, and to many others of the most admired authors whom France has produced in our own day. It is still more remarkable to find the same depressing spirit shedding its malig¬ nant influence on French literature, as early as the time of La Rochefoucauld, and even of Mon¬ taigne ; and to observe how very little has been done by the successors of these old writers, but to expand into grave philosophical systems their loose and lively paradoxes; disguising and for¬ tifying them by the aid of those logical princi¬ ples, to which the name and authority of Locke have given so wide a circulation in Europe","Of, Plato, Addison, Mon","FR,TR,CO,US,IN",8,"France,Turkey,Colombia,United States,India","Europe,Asia,South America,North America,Asia"
"In the actual state of science, these speculations might well have been spared. Where is the sober metaphysician to be found, who now speaks of the immortality of the soul as a logi¬ cal consequence of its immateriality; instead of considering it as depending on the will of that Being by whom it was at first called into exist¬ ence ? And, on the other hand, is it not uni¬ versally admitted by the best philosophers, that whatever hopes the light of nature encourages beyond the present scene, rest solely (like all our other anticipations of future events) on the general tenor and analogy of the laws by which we perceive the universe to he governed ? The proper use of the argument concerning the im¬ materiality of mind, is not to establish any posi¬ tive conclusion as to its destiny hereafter ; hut to repel the reasonings alleged by materialists, as proofs that its annihilation must he the ob¬ vious and necessary effect of the dissolution of the body.1 I thought it proper to state this consideration pretty fully, lest it should be supposed that the logical method recommended by Descartes for studying the phenomena of mind, has any ne¬ cessary dependence on his metaphysical opinion concerning its being and properties, as a separate substance.2 3 Between these two parts of his system, however, there is, if not a demonstrative connection, at least a natural and manifest af¬ finity ; inasmuch as a steady adherence to his logical method (or, in other words, the habitual exercise of patient refection), by accustoming us to break asunder the obstinate associations to which materialism is indebted for the early hold it is apt to take of the fancy, gradually and insensibly predisposes us in favour of his me¬ taphysical conclusion. It is to be regretted, that, in stating this conclusion, his commentators should so frequently make use of the word spiri¬ tuality ; for which I do not recollect that his own works afford any authority. The proper expression is immateriality, conveying merely a negative idea; and, of consequence, implying nothing more than a rejection of that hypothesis concerning the nature of M(pd, which the scheme of materialism so gratuitously, yet so dogmati¬ cally assumes.5 The power of Reflection, it is well known, is the last of our intellectual faculties that unfolds itself; and, in by far the greater number of in¬ dividuals, it never unfolds itself in any consider¬ able degree. It is a fact equally certain, that, long before the period of life when this power begins to exercise its appropriate functions, the understanding is already preoccupied with a 1 “ We shall here be content,” says the learned John Smith of Cambridge, “with that sober thesis of Plato, in his Timasus, who attributes the perpetuation of all substances to the benignity and liberality of the Creator; whom he there¬ fore brings in thus speaking, vpik; ix. a6a.va.roi ovSi uXuroi, x. r.

"Unfortunately for Descartes, while he so clear¬ ly perceived that the origin of those ideas which are the most interesting to human happiness, could not he traced to our external senses, he had the weakness, instead of stating this funda¬ mental proposition in plain and precise terms, to attempt an explanation of it by the extrava¬ gant hypothesis of innate ideas. This hypothesis gave Gassendi great advantages over him, in the management of their controversy; while the subsequent adoption of Gassendi’s reasonings against it by Locke, has led to a very general but ill-founded belief, that the latter, as well as the former, rejected, along with the doctrine of innate ideas, the various important and well- ascertained truths combined with it in the Car¬ tesian system.1 The hypothetical language afterwards intro¬ duced by Leibnitz concerning the human soul (which he sometimes calls a living mirror of the universe, and sometimes supposes to contain within itself the seeds of that knowledge which is gradually unfolded in the progressive exercise of its faculties), is another impotent attempt to explain a mystery unfathomable by human rea¬ son. The same remark may be extended to some of Plato’s reveries on this question, more particularly to his supposition, that those ideas which cannot be traced to any of our external senses, were acquired by the soul in its state of pre-existence. In all of these theories, as well as in that of Descartes, the cardinal truth is as¬ sumed as indisputable, that the Senses are not the only sources of human knowledge; nor is any thing wanting to render them correctly lo¬ gical, but the statement of this truth as an ulti¬ mate fact {or at least as a fact hitherto unex¬ plained) in our intellectual frame",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America

These changes in the fibres of the brain are commonly called by Malebranche ebranlemens;—a word which is frequently rendered by his old English translator (Taylor) vibrations. “ La seconde chose,” says Malebranche, “ qui se trouve dans chacune des sensations, est Vebranlement des fibres de nos nerfs, qui se communique jusqu’au cerveau thus translated by Taylor: “ The second thing that occurs in every sensation is the vibration of the fibres of our nerves, which is communicated to the brain.”—Liv. i. chap, xii.)

"Some preliminary steps towards such an union had been already taken by Wallis in England, and by Mersenne in France; but the literary commerce, of which they were the centres, was confined almost exclusively to Mathematics and to Physics; while the comprehensive corre¬ spondence of Leibnitz extended alike to every pursuit interesting to man, either as a specu¬ lative or as an active being. From this time forward, accordingly, the history of philosophy involves, in a far greater degree than at any former period, the general history of the human mind; and we shall find, in our attempts to trace its farther progress, our attention more and more irresistibly withdrawn from local de¬ tails to more enlarged views of the globe which we inhabit. A striking change in this literary commerce among nations took place, at least in the western parts of Europe, before the death of Leibnitz; hut, during the remainder of the last century, it continued to proceed with an accelerated rapidity over the whole face of the civilised world. A multitude of causes, un¬ doubtedly, conspired to produce it; hut I know of no individual whose name is better entitled than that of Leibnitz, to mark the era of its commencement.1 I have already, in treating of the philosophy of Locke, said enough, and perhaps more than enough, of the opinion of Leibnitz concerning the origin of our knowledge. Although expressed in a different phraseology, it agrees in the most essential points with the innate ideas of the Car¬ tesians ; hut it approaches still more nearly to some of the mystical speculations of Plato. The very exact coincidence between the language of Leibnitz on this question, and that of his con¬ temporary Cudworth, whose mind, like his own, was deeply tinctured with the Platonic Meta¬ physics, is not unworthy of notice here, as an historical fact; and it is the only remark on this part of his system which I mean to add at pre¬ sent to those in the preceding history",Plato,"FR,CO",8,"France,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"The theory of pre-established harmony led, by a natural and obvious transition, to the scheme of Optimism. As it represented all events, both in the physical and moral worlds, as the neces¬ sary effects of a mechanism originally contrived and set a-going by the Deity, it reduced its au¬ thor to the alternative of either calling in ques¬ tion the Divine power, wisdom, and goodness, or of asserting that the universe which he had called into being was the best of all possible systems. This last opinion, accordingly, was eagerly embraced by Leibnitz; and forms the subject of a work entitled Theodiccea, in which are combined together, in an extraordinary de¬ gree, the acuteness of the logician, the imagina¬ tion of the poet, and the impenetrable, yet sub¬ lime darkness, of the metaphysical theologian.5 The modification of Optimism, however, adopt¬ ed by Leibnitz, was, in some essential respects, peculiar to himself. It differed from that of Plato, and of some other sages of antiquity, in considering the human mind in the light of a spiritual machine, and, of consequence, in posi- 1 Absurd as the hypothesis of a Pre-established Harmony may now appear, not many years have elapsed since it was the pre vailing, or rather universal creed, among the philosophers of Germany. “II fut un temps” (says the celebrated Euler/ “ ou le systeme de Pharmonie pre-etablie etoit tellement en vogue dans toute PAllemagne, que ceux qui en doutoient, pas- soient pour des ignorans, ou des esprits bornes.”—(Letires de M. Euler d une Princesse d'Allemagne, 83e Lettre.) It would be amusing to reckon up the succession of metaphysical creeds which have been since swallowed with the same implicit faith by this learned and speculative, and (in all those branches of knowledge where imagination has no influence over the judg¬ ment) profound and inventive nation",Plato,"DE,CO",8,"Germany,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"According to Plato, every thing is right, so far as it is the work of God;—the creation of beings endowed with free will, and consequently liable to moral delinquency—and the government of the world by general laws, from which oc¬ casional evils must result,—furnishing no ob¬ jection to the perfection of the universe, to which a satisfactory reply may not he found in the partial and narrow views of it, to which our fa¬ culties are at present confined. But he held at the same time, that, although the permission of moral evil does not detract from the goodness of God, it is nevertheless imputable to man as a fault, and renders him justly obnoxious to punishment. This system (under a variety of forms) has been in all ages maintained by the wisest and best philosophers, who, while they were anxious to vindicate the perfections of God, saw the importance of stating their doctrine in a manner not inconsistent with man’s free will and moral agency",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"The scheme of Optimism, on the contrary, as 127 proposed by Leibnitz, is completely subversive of these cardinal truths. It was, indeed, view¬ ed by the great and excellent author in a very different light; hut in the judgment of the most impartial and profound inquirers, it leads, by a short and demonstrative process, to the annihi¬ lation of all moral distinctions.1 It is of great importance to attend to the dis¬ tinction between these two systems; because it has, of late, become customary among sceptical writers, to confound them studiously together, in order to extend to both that ridicule to which the latter is justly entitled. This, in particu¬ lar, was the case with Voltaire, who, in many parts of his later works, and more especially in his Candide, has, under the pretence of expos¬ ing the extravagancies of Leibnitz, indulged his satirical raillery against the order of the uni¬ verse. The success of his attempt was much aided by the confused and inaccurate manner in which the scheme of optimism had been re¬ cently stated by various writers, who, in their zeal to 44 vindicate the ways of God,” had been 1 It is observed by Dr Akenside, that “ the Theory of Optimism has been delivered of late, especially abroad, in a man¬ ner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that re¬ spect imitated by the best of his followers.”—(Notes on the 2d Book of the Pleasures of the Imagination.) I am perfectly aware, at the same time, that different opinions have been entertained of Plato’s real sentiments on this sub¬ ject ; and I readily grant that passages with respect to Fate and Necessity may be collected from his works, which it would be very difficult to reconcile with any one consistent scheme—(See the Notes of Mosheimon his Latin Version of Cudworth’s Intellectual System, Tome. I. pp. 10. 310, et seq. Lugd. Batav. 1773.) Without entering at all into this question, I may be permitted here to avail myself, for the sake of conciseness, of Plato’s name, to distinguish that modification of optimism which I have opposed in the text to the optimism of Leibnitz. The follow¬ ing sentence, in the 10th Book De Repuhlica, seems sufficient of itself to authorise this liberty:—'Aeirri Si d.'Sira-oTov, %v riftwv xa) cc'riy.K^wv, vrAiov xou iAccrrov otvrrts ixaixTos &%u. alrla. iAo[/.tvu. ©sc? avuiTiog.

"129 nets may be supposed to have any practical ef¬ fect on human conduct, the tendency of his doc¬ trines is not less dangerous than that of the most obnoxious systems avowed by his predecessors.1 The scheme of necessity was still farther adorn¬ ed and sublimed in the Theodiccea of Leibnitz, by an imagination nurtured and trained in the school of Plato. “ May there not exist,” he asks on one occasion, t£an immense space beyond the region of the stars ? and may not this empyreal heaven be filled with happiness and glory ? It may be conceived to resemble an ocean, where the rivers of all those created beings that are des¬ tined for bliss shall finish their course, when arrived in the starry system, at the perfection of their respective natures.”—(Leib.

"The fact is indisputable, and is admitted even by his most partial admirers. It may not he equally useless to remark the benefits which (whether foreseen or not by the author, is of little conse¬ quence) have actually resulted to literature from his indefatigable labours. One thing will, I ap¬ prehend, be very generally granted in his favour, that, if he has taught men to suspend their judg¬ ment, he has taught them also to think and to reason for themselves; a lesson which appeared to a late philosophical divine of so great impor¬ tance, as to suggest to him a doubt, whether it would not be better for authors to state nothing but premises, and to leave to tbeir readers the task of forming their own conclusions.1 Nor can Bayle be candidly accused of often discover¬ ing a partiality for any particular sect of philo¬ sophers.

"Nor are these the only instances in which Buffon has discovered the powers of a metaphy¬ sician. His thoughts on probabilities (a sub¬ ject widely removed from his favourite studies) afford a proof how strongly some metaphysical questions had laid hold of his curiosity, and what new lights he was qualified to throw on them, if he had allowed them to occupy more of his attention.1 * 3 * In his observations, too, on the peculiar nature of mathematical evidence, he has struck into a train of the soundest think¬ ing, in which he has been very generally fol¬ lowed by our later logicians.9 Some particular expressions in the passage I refer to are excep¬ tionable; but his remarks on what he calls Verites de Definition are just and important; nor do I remember any modern writer, of an earlier date, who has touched on the same argu¬ ment.

"Cudworth is at much pains to illustrate the Pla¬ tonic doctrine concerning the difference between sensation and intellection ; asserting that 44 some ideas of the mind proceed not from outward sensible objects, but arise from the inward ac¬ tivity of the mind itselfthat 44 even simple corporeal things, passively perceived by sense, are known and understood only by the active power of the mind and that, besides A/cr^^ara and lavras [Mara, there must he Novara or intel¬ ligible ideas, the source of which can be traced to the understanding alone.1 In the course of his speculations on these sub¬ jects, Cudworth has blended, with some very deep and valuable discussions, several opinions to which I cannot assent, and not a few propo¬ sitions which I am unable to comprehend; hut he seems to have advanced at least as far as Kant, in drawing the line between the provin¬ ces of the senses and of the understanding; and although not one of the most luminous of our English writers, he must he allowed to he far superior to the German metaphysician, both in point of perspicuity and of precision. A later writer, too, of our own country (Dr Price), a zealous follower both of Plato and of Cudworth, afterwards resumed the same argument, in a work which appeared long before the Critique of Pure Reason;2 and urged it with much force against those modern metaphysicians, who con¬ sider the senses as the sources of all our know¬ ledge. At a period somewhat earlier, many very interesting quotations of a similar import had been produced by the learned Mr Harris, from the later commentators of the Alexandrian school on the philosophy of Aristotle; and had been advantageously contrasted by him with the account given of the origin of our ideas, not only by Hobbes and Gassendi, hut by many of the professed followers of Locke. If this part of the Kantian system, therefore, was new in Germany, it certainly could have no claim to the praise of originality, in the estimation of those at all acquainted with English literature.3 In order, however, to strike at the root of what the Germans call the philosophy of sensa- morale de Price pre'sente en effet une analogic frappante avec ceile de Kantand in another part of his work, he expresses himself thus on the same subject: “ Le plus remarquable de tous les moralistes modernes de PAngleterre est, sans con- tredit, Richard Price On remarque 1’analogie la plus frappante entre ses idees sur les bases de lamoralite, et celles que la philosophie critique a fait naitre en Allemagne, quoique il ne soit cependant pas possible d’elever le plus petit doute sur I’entiere originalite de ces dernieres.”—(Tom. V. p. 303.)

"properly an act of the sensitive than of the cogi¬ tative part of our natures.”—[Ibid. p. 321.) The distinction here alluded to between the sensitive and the cogitative parts of our nature (it may be proper to remind my readers) makes a great figure in the works of Cudworth and of Kant. By the former it was avowedly borrowed from the philosophy of Plato. To the latter, it is not improbable, that it may have been sug¬ gested by this passage in Hume. Without dis¬ puting its justness or its importance, I may be permitted to express my doubts of the propriety of stating, so strongly as has frequently been done, the one of these parts of our nature in contrast with the other. Would it not be more philosophical, as well as more pleasing, to con¬ template the beautiful harmony between them, and the gradual steps by which the mind is train¬ ed by the intimations of the former, for the de¬ liberate conclusions of the latter? If, for example, our conviction of the permanence of the laws of nature be not founded on any process of reasoning (a proposition which Mr Hume seems to have established with demonstrative evidence), but be either the result of an instinctive principle of belief, or of the association of ideas, opera¬ ting at a period when the light of reason has not yet dawned, what can be more delightful than to find this suggestion of our sensitive frame.)1 verified by every step which our reason afterwards makes in the study of physical science ; and con¬ firmed with mathematical accuracy by the never- failing accordance of the phenomena of the heavens with the previous calculations of astro¬ nomers ! Does not this afford a satisfaction to the mind, similar to what it experiences, when we consider the adaptation of the instinct of suc¬ tion, and of the organs of respiration, to the physical properties of the atmosphere ? So far from encouraging scepticism, such a view of hu¬ man nature seems peculiarly calculated to silence every doubt about the veracity of our faculties.2 It is not my business at present to inquire into the soundness of Mr Hume’s doctrines on this subject. The rashness of some of them has, in my opinion, been sufficiently shown by more than one of his antagonists. I wish only to re¬ mark the important step which he made, in ex¬ posing the futility of the reasonings by which Hobbes, Clarke, and Locke, had attempted to demonstrate the metaphysical axiom, that “every thing which begins to exist must have a cause;” and the essential service which he rendered to true philosophy, by thus pointing out indirectly 1 Upon either of these suppositions, Mr Hume would, with equal propriety, have referred our anticipation of the future event to the sensitive part of our nature; and, in point of fact, the one supposition would have answered his purpose as well as the other","Kant, Plato","KG,CO",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Asia,South America"
"On comparing the opposition which Mr Hume’s scepticism encountered from his own countrymen, with the account formerly given of the attempts of some German philosophers to refute his Theory of Causation, it is impossible not to be struck with the coincidence between the leading views of his most eminent antago¬ nists. This coincidence one would have been disposed to consider as purely accidental, if Kant, by his petulant sneers at Reid, Beattie, and Oswald, had not expressly acknowledged, that he was not unacquainted with their writ¬ ings. As for the great discovery, which he seems to claim as his own,—that the ideas of Cause and Effect, as well as many others, are derived from the pure understanding without any aid from experience, it is nothing more than a repetition, in very nearly the same terms, of what was advanced a century before by Cud- worth, in reply to Hobbes and Gassendi; and borrowed avowedly by Cudworth from the rea¬ sonings of Socrates, as reported by Plato, in answer to the scepticism of Protagoras. This recurrence, under different forms, of the same metaphysical controversies, which so often sur¬ prises and mortifies us in the history of litera¬ ture^ is an evil which will probably always con¬ tinue, more or less, even in the most prosperous state of philosophy. But it affords no objection to the utility of metaphysical pursuits. While the sceptics keep the field, it must not be aban¬ doned by the friends of sounder principles; nor ought they to be discouraged from their un¬ grateful task, by the reflection, that they have probably been anticipated, in everything they have to say, by more than one of their predeces¬ sors. If any thing is likely to check this perio¬ dical return of a mischief so unpropitious to the progress of useful knowledge, it seems to be the general diffusion of that historical informa¬ tion concerning the literature and science of former times, of which it is the aim of these Preliminary Dissertations to present an outline","Kant, Plato","KG,CO,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia,Germany","Asia,South America,Europe"

"“ The diversity of doctrines (says M. de Bonald) has increased, from age to age, with the number of masters, and with the progress of knowledge ; and Europe, which at present pos¬ sesses libraries filled with philosophical works, and which reckons up almost as many philoso¬ phers as writers; poor in the midst of so much riches, and uncertain, with the aid of all its guides, which road it should follow; Europe, the centre and the focus of all the lights of the world, has yet its philosophy only in expecta¬ tion.”1 2 In proof of this assertion, the author appeals to the Comparative History of Philosophical Sys¬ tems relative to the Principles of Human Knowledge, by M. Degerando ; and after a variety of acute strictures on the contradictory systems there de ¬ scribed, sums up his argument in the following words: “ Thus, the Comparative History of Philosophi¬ cal Systems is nothing else than a History of the Variations of philosophical schools, leaving no other impression upon the reader than an in¬ surmountable disgust at all philosophical re¬ searches ; and a demonstrated conviction of the impossibility of raising an edifice on a soil so void of consistency, and so completely surrounded by the most frightful precipices. About what then are philosophers agreed ? What single point have they placed beyond the reach of dispute ? Plato and Aristotle inquired, What is science? What is knowledge ? And we, so many ages after these fathers of philosophy ; we, so proud of the progress of human reason, still continue to re¬ peat the same questions; vainly pursuing the same phantoms which the Greeks pursued two thousand years ago.”® In reply to this hold attack on the evidence of the moral sciences, it may suffice to recal to our recollection the state of physical science not more than two centuries ago.

"Among the secondary mischiefs resulting from the temporary popularity of Kant, none is more to be regretted than the influence of his works on the habits, both of thinking and of writing, of some very eminent men, who have since given to the world histories of philosophy. That of Tenneman in particular (a work said to possess great merit) would appear to have been vitiated by this unfortunate bias in the views of its author. A very competent judge has said of it, that <c it affords, as far as it is completed, the most accurate, the most minute, and the most rational view we yet possess of the different systems of philosophy; but that the critical philosophy being chosen as the vantage ground from whence the survey of former systems is taken, the continual reference in Kant’s own language to his peculiar doctrines, renders it frequently impossible for those who have not Notes studied the dark works of this modern Heracli- iiius^alions tus to understand the strictures of the historian on the systems even of Aristotle or Plato.” (See the article Brucker in the Encyclo- pcedia Britannica, 7th Ed.) We are told by the same writer, that “ among the learned of Germany, Brucker has never enjoyed a very distinguished reputation.” This I can very easily credit; but I am more inclined to in¬ terpret it to the disadvantage of the German taste, than to that of the historian. Brucker is indeed not distinguished by any extraordinary measure of depth or of acuteness; but in indus¬ try, fidelity, and sound judgment, he has few superiors; qualities of infinitely greater value in the undertaker of a historical work, than that passion for systematical refinement, which is so apt to betray the best-intentioned writers into false glosses on the opinions they record","Kant, Kant, Plato","DE,KG,CO",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Europe,Asia,South America"
"(9.) Thus, as we separate the affections from the desires, we distinguish the moral sense, or conscience, from both. Butler, and Mackintosh with him, express the relation of conscience to the other principles of action, by ascribing to it a supremacy,1 or a right of command. This lan¬ guage is metaphorical, but in that respect it does not differ from all the rest of the language which we use concerning mental operations and rela¬ tions ; and the material question is, whether, in this case, the language is intelligible. It is lan¬ guage which has been familiarly used from the time of Aristotle and Plato to our own ; and I think it will be seen by any one who reads with attention the pages of good writers who employ this language, as for instance Butler, that they have a distinct meaning in their minds, and that their expressions are fitted to convey it. Butler shews that prudential self-love is a principle dif¬ fering from the desires and passions in other ways than in mere strength ; and thus establishes that there is a difference of kind and order, as well as of degree and power, among our active principles",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"If we are to promote human happiness in this sense, I do not see how the same obligation does not lie upon us to promote the happiness of brutes with the same care. And if the pleasures of sense differ only in intensity and duration from the pleasures of filial and parental affection, we ought to know how many days of luxurious living are equivalent to the pleasure of saving a father’s life, that we may decide rightly when these claims hap¬ pen to come in competition. If utilitarian moral obligation consists in being regulated by such cal¬ culations, we cannot be surprised at the disgust with which so many persons speak of the scheme which refers us to “ the calculations of utility.” (13.) I shall not pretend to determine whe¬ ther Mr Bentham, and those who agree with him, have sometimes overlooked the conditions under which alone their principle can be safely applied; or whether, at any period, they were justly liable to Mackintosh’s censure (p. 392) of “ clinging to opinions because they are obnoxious; of wantonly wounding the most respectable feelings of man¬ kind.” In more recent times this cannot, I think, be said of them ; for extreme opinions on the poli¬ tical questions of the day, however unfavourable may be their influence on the moral speculations with which they are combined, are not appro¬ priately spoken of in such terms. At present I think we may discern in utilitarian writers a wish to conciliate rather than to shock the moral sym¬ pathies of their countrymen ; and perhaps the opposite schools of moralists may thus be brought nearer to each other. If those who profess to make the utility of our actions the measure of their morality, include in utility the effect upon the moral habits of ourselves and others;—if they repel with indignation the charge that they lose sight of virtuous feeling, and of the beneficial in¬ fluence of good actions on the frame of mind ;— if they claim to have their estimate of good inter¬ preted in the same way as Plato’s ; and speak of “ that generous and inspiring tone which gives so much of their usefulness as well as of their charm” to writings such as his;—if they even become dis¬ contented with the name of utility, and wish to have their science called deontology ;—the ques¬ tion at issue between them and their opponents ceases to be a difference of moral rule, and, almost, to be a discordance of moral feeling; and becomes rather a point of metaphysical analysis. They do not indeed become a deontological school, but they shew how near a eudemonist school may approach to being so",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"Plato, the most famous of his scholars, the most eloquent of Grecian writers, and the earliest moral philosopher whose writings have come down to us, employed his genius in the compo¬ sition of dialogues, in which his master per¬ formed the principal part.

"The application to moral qualities of terms which denote outward beauty, though by him perhaps carried to excess, is an illustrative me¬ taphor, as well warranted by the poverty of lan¬ guage as any other employed to signify the acts or attributes of mind.1 The beautiful in his language denoted all that of which the mere contemplation is in itself delightful, without any admixture of organic pleasure, and without being regarded as the means of attaining any farther end. The feeling which belongs to it he called love; a word which, as comprehending compla¬ cency, benevolence, and affection, and reaching from the neighbourhood of the senses to the most sublime of human thoughts, is foreign from the colder and more exg.ct language of our philoso¬ phy ; but which perhaps then happily served to lure both the lovers of poetry and the votaries of superstition to the school of truth and good¬ ness in the groves of the Academy. He enforced .these lessons by an inexhaustible variety of just and beautiful illustrations,—sometimes striking from their familiarity, sometimes subduing by their grandeur; and his works are the store¬ house from which moralists have from age to age borrowed the means of rendering moral in¬ struction easier and more delightful. Virtue he represented as the harmony of the whole soul;— as a peace between all its principles and desires, assigning to each as much space as they can oc¬ cupy, without encroaching on each other;—as a state of perfect health, in which every function was performed with ease, pleasure, and vigour ; —as a well-ordered commonwealth, where the obedient passions executed with energy the laws and commands of reason. The vicious mind presented the odious character, sometimes of dis¬ cord, of war;—sometimes of disease;—always of passions warring with each other in eternal anarchy. Consistent with himself, and at peace with his fellows, the good man felt in the quiet of his conscience a foretaste of the approbation of God. “ Oh what ardent love would virtue inspire if s|ie could be seen.” “ If the heart of a tyrant could be laid bare, we should see how it was cut and torn by its own evil passions and by an avenging conscience.” 2 * * * * * Perhaps in every one of these illustrations, an eye trained in the history of Ethics may discover the germ of the whole or of a part of some sub¬ sequent theory. But to examine it thus would not be to look at it with the eye of Plato. His aim was as practical as that of Socrates. He employed every topic, without regard to its place in a system, or even always to its force as argument, which could attract the small portion of the community then accessible to cultivation; who, it should not be forgotten, had no moral instructor but the philosopher, unaided, if not thwarted, by the reigning superstition: for reli¬ gion had not then, besides her own discoveries, brought down the most awful and the most beautiful forms of moral truth to the humblest station in human society.8 Ethics retained her sober spirit in the hands of his great scholar and rival Aristotle, who, 1 The most probable etymology of seems to be from to burn.

"though he certainly surpassed all men in acute distinction, in suhtile argument, in severe me¬ thod, in the power of analyzing what is most compounded, and of reducing to simple prin¬ ciples the most various and unlike appearances, yet appears to be still more raised above his fel¬ lows by the prodigious faculty of laying aside these extraordinary endowments whenever his present purpose required it; as in his History of Animals, in his Treatises on Philosophical Cri¬ ticism, and in his Practical Writings, political as well as moral. Contrasted as his genius was to that of Plato, not only by its logical and me¬ taphysical attributes, hut by the regard to ex¬ perience and observation of nature which, in him perhaps alone, accompanied them;—though they may be considered as the original represen¬ tatives of the two antagonist tendencies of Phi¬ losophy—that which would ennoble man, and that which seeks rather to explain nature; yet opposite as they are in other respects, the mas¬ ter and the scholar combine to guard the Rule of Life against the licentious irruptions of the Sophists",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"In Ethics alone their systems differed more in words than in things.1 That happiness con¬ sisted in virtuous pleasure, chiefly dependent on the state of mind, but not unaffected by outward agents, was the doctrine of both. Both would with Socrates have called Happiness “ unre¬ pented Pleasure.” Neither distinguished the two elements which they represented as consti¬ tuting the supreme good from each other; part¬ ly, perhaps, from a fear of appearing to separate them. Plato more habitually considered happi¬ ness as the natural fruit of virtue; Aristotle oftener viewed virtue as the means of attaining happiness. The celebrated doctrine of the Peri¬ patetics, which placed all virtues in a medium between opposite vices, was probably suggested by the Platonic representation of its necessity to keep up harmony between the different parts of our nature. The perfection of a compound machine is attained where all its parts have the fullest scope for action. Where one is so far exerted as to repress others, there is a vice of excess. When any one has less activity than it might exert without disturbing others, there is a vice of defect. The point which all reach without collision against each other, is the me¬ diocrity in which the Peripatetics placed virtue",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"It was not till near a century after the death of Plato that Ethics became the scene of philo¬ sophical contest between the adverse schools of Epicurus and Zeno; whose errors afford an in¬ structive example, that in the formation of the¬ ory, partial truth is equivalent to absolute falsehood. As the astronomer who left either the centripetal or the centrifugal force of the planets out of his view, would err as completely as he who excluded both, so the Epicureans and Stoics, who each confined themselves to real but not exclusive principles in morals, departed as widely from the truth as if they had adopted no part of it. Every partial theory is indeed di¬ rectly false, inasmuch as it ascribes to one or few causes what is produced by more. As the extreme opinions of one if not both of these schools have been often revived with variations and refinements in modern times, and are still not without influence on ethical systems, it may be allowable to make some observations on this earliest of moral controversies",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America

"Though Cassius was an Epicurean, the true re¬ presentative of that school was the accomplished, prudent, friendly, good-natured timeserver At- ticus, the pliant slave of every tyrant, who could kiss the hand of Antony, imbrued as it was in the blood of Cicero. The pure school of Plato sent forth Marcus Brutus, the signal humanity of whose life was both necessary and sufficient to prove that his daring breach of venerable rules flowed only from that dire necessity which left no other means of upholding the most sacred principles. The Roman orator, though in spe¬ culative questions ho embraced that mitigated doubt which allowed most ease and freedom to his genius, yet in those moral writings where his heart was most deeply interested, followed the severest sect of philosophy, and became al¬ most a Stoic. If any conclusion may he ha¬ zarded from this trial of systems, the greatest which history has recorded, we must not refuse our decided though not undistinguishing pre¬ ference to that noble school which preserved great souls untainted at the court of dissolute and ferocious tyrants; which exalted the slave of one of Nero’s courtiers to he a moral teacher of aftertimes; which for the first, and hitherto for the only time, breathed philosophy and jus¬ tice into those rules of law which govern the ordinary concerns of every man; and which, above all, has contributed, by the examples of Marcus Porcius Cato and of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, to raise the dignity of our species, to keep alive a more ardent love of virtue, and a more awful sense of duty, throughout all ge¬ nerations. 1 4 The result of this short review of the practi¬ cal philosophy of Greece seems to be, that though it was rich in rules for the conduct of life, and in exhibitions of the beauty of virtue, and though it contains glimpses of j ust theory and fragments of perhaps every moral truth, yet it did not leave behind any precise and coherent system; un¬ less we except that of Epicurus, who purchased consistency, method, and perspicuity too dearly by the sacrifice of truth, and by narrowing and lowering his views of human nature, so as to enfeeble, if not extinguish, all the vigorous mo¬ tives to arduous virtue. It is remarkable, that while of the eight Professors who taught in the Porch, from Zeno to Posidonius, everyone either softened or exaggerated the doctrines of his pre¬ decessor ; and while the beautiful and reverend philosophy of Plato had, in his own Academy, degenerated into a scepticism which did not spare morality itself, the system of Epicurus re¬ mained without change; and his disciples con¬ tinued for ages to show personal honours to his memory, in a manner which may seem unac¬ countable among those who were taught to measure propriety by a calculation of palpable _1 Of all testimonies to the character of the Stoics, perhaps the most decisive is the speech of the vile sycophant Ca- pito, in the mock impeachment of Thrasea Paetus, before a senate of slaves: “ Ut quondam C.

"The schoolmen were properly theologians, who employed philosophy only to define and support that system of Christian belief which they and their contemporaries had embraced.

This extraordinary man became, after some struggles, the chief Doctor, and for ages almost the sole oracle of the Latin church.

"The Augustinian doctrines of original sin, pre¬ destination, and grace, little known to the ear¬ lier Christian writers, who appear indeed to have adopted opposite and milder opinions, were espoused by Augustin himself in his old age; when by a violent swing from his youthful Mauicheism, which divided the sovereignty of the world between two adverse beings, he did not shrink, in his pious solicitude for tracing the power of God in all events, from presenting the most mysterious parts of the moral govern¬ ment of the universe, in their darkest colours and their sternest shape, as articles of faith, the objects of the habitual meditation and practical assent of mankind. The principles of his rigor¬ ous system, though not with all their legitimate consequences, were taught in the schools; re¬ spectfully promulgated rather than much incul¬ cated by the western church (for in the East these opinions seem to have been unknown); scarcely perhaps distinctly assented to by the majority of the clergy; and seldom heard of by laymen till the systematic genius and fervid eloquence of Calvin rendered them a popular creed in the most devout and moral portion of the Christian world. Anselm,2 the Piedmontese archbishop of Canterbury, was the earliest re¬ viver of the Augustinian opinions. Aquinas3 was their most redoubted champion. To them, however, the latter joined others of a different spirit. Faith, according to him, was a virtue, not in the sense in which it denotes the things believed, but in that in which it signifies the state of mind which leads to right belief. Good¬ ness he regarded as the moving principle of the Divine government; justice, as a modification of goodness; and, with all his zeal to magnify the sovereignty of God, he yet taught, that though God always wills what is just, nothing is j ust solely because he wills it. Scotus,4 the most subtile of doctors, recoils from the Augus¬ tinian rigour, though he rather intimates than avows his doubts. He was assailed for his ten¬ dency towards the Pelagian or Anti-Augusti- nian doctrines by many opponents, of whom the most famous in his time was Thomas Brad- wardine,5 archbishop of Canterbury, formerly confessor of Edward III., whose defence of pre¬ destination was among the most noted works of that age. He revived the principles of the an¬ cient philosophers, who, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius, taught that error of judgment, being involuntary, is not the proper subject of moral disapprobation; which indeed is implied in Aquinas’s account of faith.6 But he appears to have been the first whose language inclined to- 1 Notes and Illustrations, note B","Canterbury, Canterbury, Plato","GB,CO",8,"United Kingdom,Colombia","Europe,South America"

If this is true, neither those who have taken them, nor those who purchased them, nor those who hold them in bondage, can ever have a quiet conscience till they emancipate them, even if no compensation should be ob¬ tained.”7 As the work which contains this memorable condemnation of man-stealing and slavery was the substance of lectures many years delivered at Salamanca, philosophy and religion 1 Many of the separate dissertations, on points of this nature, are contained in the immense collection entitled Trac/afia Tractatuum, published at Venice in 1584, under the patronage of the Roman see.

"Grace belongs only to natural movements; and Lord Shaftesbury, notwithstanding the frequent beauty of his thoughts and language, has rarely attained it. He is unfortunately prone to plea¬ santry, which is obstinately averse from con¬ straint, and which he had no interest in raising to be the test of truth. His affectation of liveliness as a man of the world, tempts him sometimes to overstep the indistinct boundaries which sepa¬ rate familiarity from vulgarity. Of his two more considerable writings, the Moralists, on which he evidently most valued himself, and which is spoken of by Leibnitz with enthusiasm, is by no means the happiest. Yet perhaps there is scarcely any composition in our language more lofty in its moral and religious sentiments, and more exquisitely elegant and musical in its diction, than the Platonic representation of the scale of beauty and love, in the speech to Palemon, near the close of the first part.1 * Many passages might be quoted, which in some measure justify the enthusiasm of the septuage¬ narian geometer. Yet it is not to be concealed that, as a whole, it is heavy and languid. It is a modern antique. The dialogues of Plato are often very lively representations of conversations which might take place daily at a great univer¬ sity, full, like Athens, of rival professors and eager disciples,—^between men of various character, and great fame as well as ability. Socrates runs through them all. His great abilities, his still more venerable virtues, his cruel fate, especially when joined to his very characteristic pecu¬ liarities,—to his grave humour, to his homely sense, to his assumed humility, to the honest sliness with which he ensnared the Sophists, and to the intrepidity with which he dragged them to justice, gave unity and dramatic inter¬ est to these dialogues as a whole. But Lord Shaftesbury’s dialogue is between fictitious per¬ sonages, and in a tone at utter variance with English conversation. He had great power of thought and command over words. But he had no talent for inventing character and bestowing life on it. The Inquiry concerning Virtue* is nearly exempt from the faulty peculiarities of the author; the method is perfect, the reasoning just, the style precise and clear. The writer has no purpose but that of honestly proving his prin¬ ciples; he himself altogether disappears; and he is intent only on earnestly enforcing what he truly, conscientiously, and reasonably believes","Of, Plato, Athens","TR,CO,US,UK",8,"Turkey,Colombia,United States,N/A","Asia,South America,North America,N/A"
"In his work on Morals, all the incidental and secondary remarks are equally well consid¬ ered and well expressed. The manner in which he applied his principle to the particulars of human duty, is excellent. He is perhaps the first philosopher who has precisely laid down and rigidly adhered to the great principle, that virtue consists in pure intentions and dispositions of mind, without which, actions, however con- JONATHAN This remarkable man, the metaphysician of America, was formed among the Calvinists of New England, when their stern doctrine retained its rigorous authority.1 2 * 4 His power of subtile ar¬ gument, perhaps unmatched, certainly unsur¬ passed among men, was joined, as in some of the ancient Mystics, with a character which raised his piety to fervour. He embraced their doctrine, probably without knowing it to he theirs. “ True religion,” says he, “ in a great measure consists in holy affections. A love of divine things, for the beauty and sweetness of their moral excellency, is the spring of all holy affections.”3 Had he suffered this noble principle to take the right road to all its fair consequences, he would have entirely concurred with Plato, with Shaftesbury, and Malebranche, in devotion to “ the first good, first perfect, and first fair.” But he thought it necessary after¬ wards to limit his doctrine to his own persua¬ sion, by denying that such moral excellence could he discovered in divine things by those formable to rules, are not truly moral; a truth of the highest importance, which, in the theolo¬ gical form, may he said to have been the main principle of the first Protestant Reformers. The ground of piety, according to him, is the con¬ formity of the attributes of God to those moral qualities which we irresistibly love and revere.1 “ Sovereign princes,” says he, “ have no right to use their authority without reason. Even God has no such miserable right.”8 His dis¬ tinction between a religious society and an established church, and his assertion of the right of the temporal power alone to employ coercion, are worthy of notice, as instances in which a Catholic, at once philosophical and or¬ thodox, could thus speak, not only of the na¬ ture of God, hut of the rights of the church",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"“ Perhaps,” says he, “ the truth about innate ideas may be, that there are properly no ideas or passive objects in the mind but what are de¬ rived from sense, but that there are also, be¬ sides these, her own acts and operations—such are notionsa statement which seems once more to admit general conceptions, and which might have served, as well as the parallel pass¬ age of Leibnitz, as the basis of the modern phi¬ losophy of Germany. From these compositions of his old age, he appears then to have recurred with fondness to Plato and the later Platonists; writers from whose mere reasonings an intellect so acute could hardly hope for an argumentative satisfaction of all its difficulties, and whom he probably rather studied as a means of inuring his mind to objects beyond the visible diurnal sphere, and of attaching it, through frequent meditation, to that perfect and transcendent goodness to which his moral feelings always pointed, and which they incessantly strove to grasp. His mind, enlarging as it rose, at length receives every theist, however imperfect his be¬ lief, to a communion in its philosophic piety",Plato,"DE,CO",8,"Germany,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"In such cases it is too little remembered, that repugnance to hypocrisy, and impatience of long concealment, are the qualities of the best formed minds; and that, if the publication of some doctrines proves often painful and mis¬ chievous, the habitual suppression of opinion is injurious to reason, and very dangerous to sin¬ cerity. Practical questions thus arise, so diffi¬ cult and perplexing, that their determination generally depends on the boldness or timidity of the individual,—on his tenderness for the feel¬ ings of the good, or his greater reverence for the free exercise of reason. The time is not yet come when the noble maxim of Plato, “ that every soul is unwillingly deprived of truth,” will be practically and heartily applied by men to the honest opponents who differ from them most widely",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"well shown the connection of domestic ties with the outward order of society, should not have perceived their deeper and closer relation to all the social feelings of human nature. It cannot he enough regretted, that, in an Enquiry wiit- ten with a very moral purpose, his habit of ma¬ king truth attractive, by throwing over her the dress of paradox, should have given him for a moment the appearance of weighing the mere amusements of society and conversation against domestic fidelity, which is the preserver of do¬ mestic affection, the source of parental fondness and filial regard, and, indirectly, of all the kind¬ ness which exists between human beings. That families are schools where the infant heart learns to love, and that pure manners are the ce¬ ment which alone holds these schools together, are truths so certain, that it is wonderful he should not have betrayed a stronger sense of their importance. No one could so well have proved that all the virtues of that class, in their various orders and degrees, minister to the be¬ nevolent affections; and that every act which separates the senses from the affections tends, in some degree, to deprive kindness of its natural auxiliary, and to lessen its prevalence in the world. It did not require his sagacity to discover that the gentlest and tenderest feelings flourish only under the stern guardianship of these severe virtues. Perhaps his philosophy was loosened, though his life was untainted, by that universal and undistinguishing profligacy which prevailed on the Continent, from the regency of the Duke of Orleans to the French revolution; the most dissolute period of European history, at least since the Roman emperors.1 At Rome, indeed, the connection of licentiousness with cruelty, which, though scarcely traceable in individuals, is generally very observable in large masses, bore a fearful testimony to the value of austere purity.

"Notes an object will remind us of the objects which Illustrations immediately preceded or followed when origi- nally perceived. But what Mr Coleridge has not told us is, that the Stagyrite confines the appli¬ cation of this law exclusively to the phenomena of recollection alone, without any glimpse of a more general operation extending to all connections of thought and feeling,—a wonderful proof, indeed, even so limited, of the sagacity of the great phi¬ losopher, hut which for many ages continued barren of further consequences. The illustra¬ tions of Aquinas throw light on the original doc¬ trine, and show that it was unenlarged in his time. “ When we recollect Socrates, the thought of Plato occurs ‘ as like him.’ When we re¬ member Hector, the thought of Achilles occurs ‘ as contrary.’ The idea of a father is followed by that of a son c as near.’ ” (Agum.

So that it would require no lit¬ tle persuasion and argument to convince them that the soul can exist after death, and can retain anything of its powers and intelligence.” When we find this asserted, or rather alluded to, as no¬ toriously the state of popular opinion, wre can surely entertain but little doubt that the accounts of Elysium and Tartarus were regarded as mere poetical fables, calculated to amuse the imagina¬ tion, but unworthy of serious belief",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America

A quan¬ tity that is unknown, is only to be found from the relations which it bears to quantities that are known.

But if they ex¬ tend to the methods of philosophizing, and the discoveries actually made, we must he excused for entering our dissent, and exchanging the language of panegyric for that of apology. The infancy of science could not he the time when its attainments were the highest; and before we suffer ourselves to be guided by the vene¬ ration of antiquity, we ought to consider in what real antiquity consists. With regard to the pro¬ gress of knowledge and improvement, <{ we are more ancient than those who went before us.”1 The human race has now more experience than in the generations that are past, and of course may be expected to have made higher attain¬ ments in science and philosophy. Compared with Natural Philosophy, as it now exists, the ancient Physics are rude and imperfect. The speculations contained in them are vague and unsatisfactory, and of little value, but as they elucidate the history of the errors and illusions to which the human mind is subject. Science was not merely stationary, but often retrograde; the earliest opinions were frequently the best; 2. NOVUM The defects which have been ascribed to the ancient Physics were not likely to be correct¬ ed in the course of the middle ages. It is true, that during those ages a science of pure experiment had made its appearance in the world, and might have been expected to remedy the greatest of these defects, by turning the at¬ tention of philosophers to experience and obser- vation. This effect, however, was far from be¬ ing immediately produced; and none who pro¬ fessed to be in search of truth ever wandered over the regions of fancy, in paths more devious and eccentric, than the first experimenters in Chemistry. They had become acquainted with a series of facts so unlike to any thing already known, that the ordinary principles of belief were shaken or subverted, and the mind laid open to a degree of credulity far beyond any with which the philosophers of antiquity could be reproached. An unlooked-for extension of and the reasonings of Democritus and Anaxa¬ goras were in many instances more solid than those of Plato and Aristotle. Extreme credu¬ lity disgraced the speculations of men who, however ingenious, were little acquainted with the laws of nature, and unprovided with the great criterion by which the evidence of testi¬ mony can alone be examined. Though obser¬ vations were sometimes made, experiments were never instituted; and philosophers who were little attentive to the facts which spontaneously offered, did not seek to increase their number by artificial combinations. Experience, in those ages, was a light which darted a few tremulous and uncertain rays on some small portions of the field of science; but men had not acquired the power over that light which now enables them to concentrate its beams, and to fix them steadily on whatever object they wish to ex¬ amine. This power is what distinguishes the modern Physics, and is the cause why later phi¬ losophers, without being more ingenious than their predecessors, have been infinitely more successful in the study of nature",Plato,CO,8,Colombia,South America
"With a view of observing the sun’s altitude in the vicinity of the equator, where the distance from the zenith being inconsiderable, the effects of refraction must be of small account, it was agreed, by the same academy, to send an astro¬ nomer, M.

"The most remarkable circumstance, however, which occurred in the course of this voyage, was, that the clock, though furnished with a pendu¬ lum of the same length which vibrated seconds at Paris, was found, at Cayenne, to lose two minutes and a half a-day nearly. This created great astonishment in France, especially after the accuracy of it was confirmed by the observa¬ tions of Varin and Deshayes, who, some years afterwards, visited different places on the coasts of Africa and America, near the line, and found the necessity of shortening the pendulum, to make it vibrate seconds in those latitudes. The first explanation of this remarkable phenomenon was given by Newton, in the third book of his Principia, published in 1687, where it is de¬ duced as a necessary consequence of the earth’s rotation on its axis, and of the centrifugal force thence arising. That force changes both the di¬ rection and the intensity of gravity, giving to the earth an oblate spheroidal figure, more elevated at the equator than the poles, and making bodies fall, and pendulums vibrate, more slowly in low than in high latitudes","Paris, Cayenne, Newton","US,FR,GF",8,"United States,France,French Guiana","North America,Europe,South America"

A satisfac¬ tory and calm reply convinced him of his mis¬ take, which he had the candour very readily to acknowledge.

"From the figure of the earth thus determined, he showed that the intensity of gravity at any point of the surface is inversely as the distance of that point from the centre; and its increase, therefore, on going from the equator to the poles, is as the square of the sine of the latitude, the same ratio in which the degrees of the meridian increase.1 As the intensity of gravity diminish¬ ed on going from the poles to the equator, or from the higher to the lower latitudes, it follow¬ ed that a pendulum of a given length would vibrate slower when carried from Europe into the torrid zone.

"to produce such a congruous appearance. Bou- guer compared the light of a candle with the dazzling brilliancy of the sun and the soft ra¬ diance of the moon; and found that the inten¬ sity diminishes from the centre to the margin of the solar disc, but that the gradation is in¬ verted in our satellite. He discovered also ex¬ perimentally the diminution of the sun’s rays in traversing the atmosphere with different angles of obliquity. The same able experimenter as¬ certained the loss of light, as occasioned under different circumstances, by reflexion and refrac¬ tion. He then held the office of Royal Hydro- grapher at Croisic in Lower Brittany; hut after his return from the laborious and memorable scientific expedition to Peru, he resumed his early pursuits, and prepared an enlarged edition of his optical work, which was edited by La- caille in 1760, two years after his death. At the same time came out the systematic treatise which Lambert entitled Photometria, designed as the sequel to a small tract which this ardent and inquisitive philosopher had printed two years before on the remarkable 'properties of the route of light through the air. This production is very complete in its mathematical structure; but the experiments on which it rests are generally not so well devised or so nicely performed as those of Bouguer. The ingenious author seems to confide too much in a sort of filtration and ad¬ justment of facts, as obtained by the aid of cal¬ culation. Lambert, in his preamble, admits the imperfection of those observations, owing to the infirmity and variable condition of the eye, and regrets that he had no instrument like the ther¬ mometer to guide the sense of vision.1 This de¬ sideratum was happily supplied before the close of the century; and the Photometer constructed on the principle of the minute differences of temperature is not only very delicate, hut ex¬ empt from the remotest chance of error. The method of shadows proposed by Count Rumford in 1796, may he reckoned an improvement on Bouguer’s procedure, hut it is liable to the in¬ superable objection of depending altogether on the patient attention of the observer and his un¬ certain sharpness of sight",,PE,8,Peru,South America
"773 damine, Bouguer, and Godin, in May 1735 sailed from Rochelle to Peru, where they joined Juan and Ulloa, two naval officers deputed by the king of Spain. The whole company assembled in the month of June in the following year at Quito, almost under the Equator, and arranged their plan of operations. They chose a valley of the Cordilleras running above 200 miles south¬ wards from that city, and inclosed on both sides by the loftiest ranges of the Andes. Divided into two troops, they carried a series of triangles along the flanks and summits of those stupen¬ dous mountains covered with eternal snows, and connected the reticulation with the base mea¬ sured below. In pursuing their laborious task, the observers had to encounter the greatest dif¬ ficulties, and to suffer privations of every kind, owing to the severity of the climate and the total want of accommodation, joined to the con¬ tinual impediments occasioned by the supersti¬ tion of the natives and the pilfering habits of the Indians. But resolution and perseverance at length overcame the multiplied obstacles, though no fewer than eight years were consum¬ ed in completing with elaborate care and accu¬ racy the different operations undertaken. Con- damine was a man of an ardent and active mind, and persuasive address; Godin, an excellent ob¬ server ; but Bouguer combined the character of a deep and original thinker, with the talent of invention, unwearied application, and an ex¬ tended acquaintance in the various pursuits of philosophy and science. The Academicians were ably assisted by their Spanish associates, though each performed separately his own calculations",Quito,"ES,PE,EC",8,"Spain,Peru,Ecuador","Europe,South America,South America"
"In the mean time, it being foreseen that the mensuration of a degree in Peru would be ne¬ cessarily retarded, the celebrated Maupertuis, a person of agreeable attainments, though not very profound in science, prevailed with the French minister Maurepas to dispatch another company, which he reluctantly consented to lead, for a similar purpose to the Arctic Circle",Maurepas,"FR,PE",8,"France,Peru","Europe,South America"
"The length of a degree of latitude at the Arctic Circle was found to be 57,419 toises, or 349 toises longer than the corresponding measure at Paris, which gave the ratio of 178 to 177 for that of the Equatorial and Polar diameters, al¬ most the same as the result of the more exten¬ sive operations afterwards in Peru. Maupertuis, having with such expedition ascertained the ob¬ lateness of the Earth, and assigned a depression still greater than had been computed by Newton, returned triumphant to Paris in the spring of 1737. But this arctic triangulation, betraying evident marks of haste, became suspected after¬ wards of inaccuracy; and, at the suggestion of Melanderhjelm, the Swedish academy, about the PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Paris, Newton, Paris","US,PE,SE",8,"United States,Peru,Sweden","North America,South America,Europe"
"After a pause of near forty years, the mensu¬ ration of the Earth was revived with increasing ardour and on a grander scale. The object first contemplated was merely to settle the difference of longitude between the observatories of Green¬ wich and Paris, by connecting them with a se¬ ries of triangles. General Roy directed the English survey in 1784, while similar operations were conducted by Cassini in France. The Re¬ volution soon followed, and prepared the public mind for the reception of every bold project. It was now proposed to adopt a universal and permanent system of weights and measures drawn from nature, the unit of lineal' extent being the thousandth part of a centesimal minute, or the ten millionth part of the quadrantal arc from the Pole to the Equator. To obtain this standard, it had been resolved to carry a chain of triangles over the whole extent, from Dunkirk to Barcelona; which was performed during the most eventful period of general excitement and commotion, by the profound sagacity, persever¬ ance, and undaunted zeal of Delambre,1 joined to 1 Born at Amiens on the 19th September 1749. Being designed for the church, he studied the ancient languages in the Gymnasium of his native city, first under the Jesuits, and afterwards under the tuition of the poet Delille, to whom he became warmly attached. At a ripe age, he was invited to the study of astronomy by Lalande, and soon adopted as his favourite pupil. In 1785 he began the vast series of his scientific labours, which occupied the rest of a long life. Without aiming at originality, Delambre produced very complete and valuable works, pursued his immense calculations with scrupulous nicety and incessant application, and distinguished himself as a most accurate, skilful, and indefatigable observer. He sought precision merely, and was rather indifferent about the elegance of his formulas or composition. Yet he was an ex¬ cellent Greek scholar, well acquainted with the principal modern languages, and indeed a man of general erudition. Gt an amiable disposition, with fixed principles of integrity joined to simple habits, he passed through all the storms of the Be- volution with a blameless character. He obtained his full share of the honours and distinction which France so liberally bestows on those eminent in science, and died universally regretted, on the 19th of August 1822","Green, Paris, Barcelona, Born, Amiens","FR,US,VE,NL,UK,PL,GR",8,"France,United States,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,Netherlands,N/A,Poland,Greece","Europe,North America,South America,Europe,N/A,Europe,Europe"
"775 Mechain.1 After completing1 this operation, they measured abase of seven miles in length near Paris, and another of verification, somewhat shorter, on the road from Perpignan to Narhonne. The register of all the observations was in the spring of 1799 submitted to a sort of congress of scien¬ tific men assembled in the French capital, who having examined and repeated the various calcu¬ lations, and compared the celestial arc with the mensuration in Peru, adopted the 334th for the oblateness of the earth, and determined the dis¬ tance of the pole from the equator to be 5,130,740 toises","Paris, Perpignan","FR,PE,US",8,"France,Peru,United States","Europe,South America,North America"
"Mechain, anxious however to extend the me¬ ridian as far as the Balearic Isles, again repaired to Spain, and conducted a series of triangles over the savage heights from Barcelona to Tortosa, when, exhausted by incessant fatigues, he caught an epidemic fever, which proved fatal in Septem¬ ber 1805. The operations were continued by his young but very able successors, Biot and Arago, who terminated the meridional arc at the isle of Formentera in 1807. This extension of the chain scarcely altered in the slightest man¬ ner the former conclusion","Barcelona, Tortosa","ES,VE",8,"Spain,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","Europe,South America"
"Cassini and Maraldi seem to have been the first to solve this interesting question. They found, in 1734 and 1735, a degree of longitude at Paris and at Strasburg to be 36,676 and 37,745 toises, 1 Born at Laon 16th August'l744, the son of an unprosperous architect, who could hardly educate him in the same pro¬ fession. The youth supported himself, and even aided his father, by teaching mathematics, and made such proficiency in astronomy as to attract the notice of Lalande, by whose warm and active patronage he soon obtained the office of hydro- grapher to the Marine at Versailles. Though he had not the talent of invention, he became an expert, patient, and correct calculator. He was, besides, a very nice and accurate observer, and applied himself particularly to the search of comets, and the computation of their orbits. In 1784 he was joined to the commission for adjusting the difference of longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich; and when the Constituent Assembly had resolved to adopt a grand metrical system founded on the length of the meridional arc, he was appointed to measure the southern portion of it from Barcelona to Kodez","Paris, Born, Laon, Versailles, Paris, Barcelona","US,FR,NL,VE",8,"United States,France,Netherlands,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","North America,Europe,Europe,South America"
"He conducted his operations with great celerity and success ; but, inspecting a new engine constructed by a friend at Barce¬ lona, he met with a dreadful accident, which had well nigh proved fatal. After a slow convalescence he resumed his labours; but every thing now combined to dishearten him,—the Avar with Spain, the ravages of the yellow fever, and the news of the reign of terror in France. After moderation had revived, Mechain with much reluctance was prevailed on to come to Paris ; but strongly pressed the expediency of extending the measurement two degrees farther into Spain, and insisted on carrying on that work himself. This pertinacity was not explained till after his death, when it appeared that he had concealed a discrepancy occurring in the rectification of his observations, which, without acknowledging the error, he no doubt hoped to remove by subsequent operations. After experiencing many difficulties, he vigorously renewed his labours in Valencia ; but his mind was depressed by anxiety for his reputation, and alarms at the spread of contagious disease. This mental prostration favoured its attack, and he expired of yellow fever in his retreat at Castellon de la Plana, on the 20th September 1805","Paris, Valencia","ES,FR,US,VE",8,"Spain,France,United States,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","Europe,Europe,North America,South America"
"From a skilful combination of the five prin¬ cipal measurements, in Peru, India, France, England, and Lapland, Mr Ivory has, by the method of the least squares, deduced for the oblateness of the Earth, and shown that the corresponding elliptical meridian agrees with the best observations. The result would have been still more satisfactory, had the English survey comprised the whole extent of the island",,"PE,IN,FR,UK",8,"Peru,India,France,N/A","South America,Asia,Europe,N/A"
"The effect of cold was early remarked by the Dutch Arctic voyagers; but Bouguer first ac¬ curately observed the diminished agency of at¬ tenuated air during his sojourn on the summits of the Andes. Yet without demonstration Brad¬ ley gave a simple rule for computing the celes¬ tial refraction, and Mayer adopted another near¬ ly similar. Thomas Simpson, in a very ingeni¬ ous dissertation, derived a formula which is sub¬ stantially the same. The subject of refraction has likewise been discussed by Lambert, Kramp, Fontana, and more recently by Laplace, Gauss, Bessel, Young, and Ivory.

"The great number of scientific names of the first or¬ der of merit concerned in these numerous discoveries marks the extraordinary fertility of the period.

"801 tion of the latter ; and a few happily still remain to claim the respect and veneration of their disciples and successors. But the vast steps so recently made in Optics, in Electricity, in Magnetism, in Thermotics, and in Chemical principles, tended of necessity to call forth such an amount of laborious detail in the de¬ fining and connecting of facts and laws, and the de¬ ductions of the theories started to explain them, as seemed to render fresh and striking originality some¬ what hopeless, whilst they occasioned a vast amount of useful employment to minds of every order of ta- Optics. lent. The undulatory Theory of Light, nobly blocked out by the massive labours of Young and Fresnel, has afforded still unexhausted material to the ma¬ thematician on the one hand, and to the experimen¬ talist on the other; and ably have they fulfilled the double task, adding at the same time discoveries whose importance and difficulty would have made them still more prominent, had they not been the legitimate consequences of a still greater discovery already in our possession. Nearly the same might have been said for the sciences of Electricity, Electro¬ magnetism, and Electro-chemistry, had not the com- Electricity. parative newness of the whole doctrine of these sci¬ ences, and the suddenness of their first rise, and, per¬ haps still more, the appearance of a philosopher of the very highest merit, Mr Faraday, who fortunately at¬ tached himself to this special department, made the last thirty years an almost unbroken period of dis¬ covery. Radiant Heat, too, has been successfully advanced by labours comparable perhaps to those which marked its first rise as a science, and some other topics connected with heat have risen into great and practical consequence. Astronomy has been prosecuted with a systematic assiduity and suc¬ cess, especially at the British and Russian national observatories, which yields to that of no former pe¬ riod, whilst physical astronomy has been cultivated by methods of still improved analysis, and has achieved one triumph which France need not grudge to England, nor England to France,—so signal as to be placed by common consent in a position su¬ perior to any since the first publication of the theory of gravitation, more than a century and a half be¬ fore. This was the prediction of the position in space of a planet whose existence was unknown ex¬ cept by the disturbance which it produced in the Magnetism, movements of another. Terrestrial Magnetism has, for the first time, aspired to the rank of an exact science. In an illustrious philosopher of Germany, it has found its Kepler ; and the combination of na¬ tional efforts in collecting reliable data from the re¬ motest corners of the globe is characteristic of the Chemistry, practical energy of the age. Pure Chemistry has been cultivated with extraordinary assiduity; but though some general principles have emerged, none are comparable, from their importance, to the dis¬ covery of Dalton.

He himself is stated to have preferred, amongst all his papers, one in the Turin Memoirs of 1784, on the Integral Calculus.2 With reference to the Lunar Libration, Lagrange (57.) confirmed the singular conclusion of Newton, that the Libration moon is a spheroid, having three unequal axes, the longest of which is always approximately directed to the earth, and the shortest is her axis of rotation","Laplace, Young, Newton","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

Em¬ ploying mathematical methods of inferior power but greater directness, and taking into account causes of local action which Laplace had not ventured to in¬ clude in his analysis, he gradually matured a theory adequate to represent many of the results of ex¬ perience, of which Laplace gives no account","Young, Laplace, Laplace, Laplace","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"He distinguishes the results of t\vQ forced and/ree oscillations of the sea ; the former resulting from the force(i direct action of the sun and moon combined with the waves, rotation of the earth, and whose periods of rise and fall are determined solely by those external causes (external, I mean, to the mass of the ocean) ; the free waves, on the contrary, derived from the former, are transmitted with velocities depending on the me¬ chanism of the fluid itself, on its depth, and on the resistances arising from friction to which those mo¬ tions are exposed. These all-important modifications of the dynamical Theoiy of the Tides were deduced by Dr Young from the general theory of oscillations and resistances, and from the laws of fluids detected by Dubuat,2 and he applied them with no ordinary skill to the solution of the problems of tides in oceans, estuaries, and rivers. It is an extraordinary fact, and not without significance, in the history of science, that these researches of Young, published anonymously in the Supplement to the Sixth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and in the Seventh Edition of this work, and likewise in several jour¬ nals and reviews, so generally escaped notice as to have been almost unknown till Dr Peacock, in his recently published “ Life and Miscellaneous Works of Dr Thomas Young” has fortunately recalled attention to their existence and their important results","Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America

So early as August 1790, the French Constituent Assembly, on the motion of Talleyrand, desired the king to write to the English government, to represent the advantage of the two nations uniting to adopt a common unit or standard of weight and measure, which it was proposed should be done by a joint committee of the Royal Society and the French Academy.2 This application was probably never made, at least nothing came of it; but the Academy named their own committee, who, after discussing three sorts of natural standards,— the length of the pendulum in lat. 45° (first proposed by Huygens in his Horologium Oscillatorium), the length of a quadrant of the equator, and that of a quadrant of the meridian from the equator to the pole assumed to be elliptic,—adopted the latter, and this labour was committed to Mechain for the southern part, from Rodez to Barcelona (170,000 toises), and to Delambre for the northern, trom Rodez to Dunkirk (380,000 toises). The southern arc was afterwards extended to Formentera in the Balearic Isles, and the whole length of the arc was found astronomically to be 12° 22' 12""-6. Two bases were measured (both by Delambre), one at Perpignan of 6006 toises, the other at Melun of 6076 toises (each about 7’3 miles). When the length of the for¬ mer was computed by triangulation from the latter, the difference of the observed and inferred amount is said to have been only ten or eleven inches","Rodez, Barcelona, Rodez, Perpignan, Melun","FR,VE,UK",8,"France,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,N/A","Europe,South America,N/A"
"were the principal means of extricating him from his difficulties : hut his danger was often imminent, and he appears to have sometimes heard the dreadful words which, as an eloquent author has expressed it, were the last sounds that vibrated in the ear of many an unhappy victim.” The operations were actually sus¬ pended for a time hy a decree of Robespierre and his colleagues, who deposed Delambre, along with Laplace, Lavoisier, Borda, and others, from the Commission of Weights and Measures, as being deficient in “ re¬ publican virtues and their hatred of kings.” They were, however, resumed, and Delambre had finished his share of the work long before his colleague Me¬ chain, whose shorter task was conducted amidst a people rude and uneducated, indeed, yet far more to be trusted than were then those of the north. Me¬ chain was apparently wayward and impracticable, somewhat too aged for so great a work, yet a really good astronomer. The want of agreement to within 3"" of two sets of observations for latitude atBarcelona, the southern end of the arc at that time, led him to the suppression of one of them, and he was tormented ever after by the consciousness of the evasion, which deprived him of the tranquillity necessary to resume and complete his work, which was done chiefly by Delambre after vexatious delays.1 The error, which may be said to have cost Mechain his life, was pro¬ bably owing to the instrument employed on this sur¬ vey, the repeating circle of Borda, only fourteen inches diameter, with a rather weak telescope. The opinion generally entertained in Britain is, that the repeating circle was quite inadequate to the prodi¬ gious accuracy required of it, especially in the deter¬ mination of latitudes. The errors of mere division are often trivial compared to those inherent in other parts of an instrument. Of these a deficiency of op¬ tical power, and the want of absolute security of the clamps, upon which the entire success of the princi¬ ple of repetition depends, are amongst the most ob¬ vious. The arc was finally prolonged from Barcelona to Formentera by Biot and Arago in 1806. The conclusion of the survey was not destitute of the ad¬ venturous character of its commencement. The French astronomers ran many risks, underwent much suffering, and Arago narrowly escaped finishing his days in the dungeons of Spain","Laplace, Barcelona, Of, Barcelona","VE,ES,US,TR,FR",8,"Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,Spain,United States,Turkey,France","South America,Europe,North America,Asia,Europe"

"(344.) Robison, indeed, with the peculiar tact and skill Thomas which I have already ascribed to him, wrote several Young. papers (contributed to an early edition of the Ency¬ clopedia Britannica, and printed in his collected works) full of acute observation and reasoning, adapted to the imperfect experiments of his time, and connected by sound scientific deductions, which are still well worthy of careful perusal; but it was to the penetration of Dr Thomas Young,1 who par¬ took strongly of Robison’s mechanical tastes, whilst he surpassed him in facility of mathematical resource, that we owe a great revision of the doctrine of the strength of materials. In the “ Syllabus of Lec¬ tures” (1802), into which he condensed, in a manner peculiar to himself, an incredible amount of positive knowledge ; in the Lectures themselves (1806), with the admirable “ Catalogue of References and in the articles on “ Bridges,” and the supplementary propositions on “ Carpentry,” which he contributed to this Encyclopaedia—we find (stated, as usual, not without some obscurity) a multitude of theorems and problems embracing the whole principles of construction, and based upon mechanical laws and the most probable interpretation of experiments","Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The measure of this resistance Young termed (not very happily) Modulus of Elasticity, expressing the Modulus o) force required to produce unit of elongation (or to Elasticity",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"double the length) of a prism of the substance un¬ der experiment. This quantity may be measured either by the length of a depending prism of the substance which would produce the requisite strain, or more simply by the strain expressed in pounds or tons, which, supposing the elongations to increase without limit as the extending forces, would double the length of the prism under experiment. Thus, in round numbers, a bar of wrought iron an inch square will be extended xok^o Pai't hy a pressure of one ton—hence the modulus of elasticity is about 10,000 tons. The elasticity of wrought iron remains perfect to about half the breaking weight, after which the elongations appear to double for each addition of about y1^ or of the breaking weight.

"But the clear modification of the theory prevalent in the time of Leibnitz and Marriotte which this consideration introduced, was probably first deve¬ loped by Coulomb, Robison, and Young, who in their respective publications insisted upon it with great judgment; and it is difficult to overrate its import¬ ance in mechanical engineering, although the first great canon of Galileo remains still true, that the ultimate strength of a solid rectangular beam varies as the breadth and as the square of the depth",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The writings of Young and Robison did not im¬ mediately attract the attention of practical men, and Coulomb, who was by far the ablest French experimenter on subjects of mixed mechanics, seems to have done less on the theory of strains producing flexure than in the case of torsion, which he studied with so much success, and applied to such excellent purpose. Nevertheless in his memoir on the Resistance of Masonry, in the 7th vol. of the “ Memoires Presentes” (1776), he had already laid down very clearly the effect of compression on abeam.1 2 It is, however, to Young that we owe the application of these principles in unfolding their legitimate conse¬ quences. In a series of remarkable propositions con¬ tained in the writings I have quoted (344), he assigns numerical relations between the flexure of a beam under almost every supposable circumstance, and the resistance of the material to direct strains. These results have been extensively used by all subsequent writers. They are not equally verified in all classes of substances. This, however, is not wonderful; flexure is not due to direct compressive and extending strains alone ; deformation may take place in a solid without appreciable change of density, thus giving rise to some of the nicest questions in molecular physics","Young, Young","UY,FR",8,"Uruguay,France","South America,Europe"
"The mathematical investigations of Young on (349.) mechanical problems were conducted with bold di- Young's rectness and in defiance of the generalizing methods and symmetrical notation of foreign writers on such subjects. But his pre-eminent sagacity in laying hold on the salient points of the questions he discussed, and in conducting his argument to a practical con¬ clusion, was unequalled, and deserves imitation.3 A great revival in the study of the properties of (350.) elastic matter, as regards strength, took place about General the year 1820, probably in consequence of the in-^®^ troduction of wrought iron into the construction ofiron> suspension bridges, which has been attended with important results","Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America

This investigation may be found in a very elaborate paper in the Cambridge Transactions,2 in which he solves the equations found by him in a previous paper,3 in the cases of pendulums having the forms just mentioned. Another interesting re¬ sult of his investigation is the immense effect of fluid friction in retarding the fall of minute rain drops, which he states to be such as to explain satisfactorily the suspension of clouds.

The theory of Laplace, so far as it was based on novel grounds, was anticipated by Dr Young, and gave rise to several controversial articles by that most eminent philosopher, of which an account will be found in Dr Peacock's Life of Young, pages 199-210, as well as a most excellent review of the subject of Capillary Attraction, which, indeed, by its candour and completeness, supersedes anything which I should have felt disposed to say on the subject","Laplace, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

He had already de¬ clined the overtures of such distinguished patrons as Windham and Burke, resolving to devote himself to the pursuit of science, for which a medical education seemed to him a fit entrancehis studies being made under the more immediate advice of his uncle, Dr Broeklesby. He attended Black’s lectures in Edin¬ burgh ; whether he was known to Robison I am not aware, though I should be inclined to infer that he was from the terms in which Robison speaks of Young when criticising his strictures upon Smith’s Harmonics. Robison disagreed with him on this point, and also about the nature of light, yet he speaks of Young and of his paper on Sound with very marked respect. More than a year before his enrolment at Edinburgh (which took place in autumn 1794), he communicated to the Royal Society of London a paper on vision, of which we shall pre¬ sently give some further account; and was elected a fellow of the Society when just of age","Edinburgh, Windham, Burke, Young, Young, Edinburgh, London","GB,US,UY",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay","Europe,North America,South America"
"I have entered into these details because they throw light on the peculiarities of Young’s cha¬ racter and attainments. He was to a great degree self-educated ; and his studies in consequence may be called desultory, though none would dare to call them superficial. Mathematicians may consider his acquaintance with their science as not technically complete, yet one of them admits that “ he could make a small amount of mathematics go farther than any one else.” Had he been a consummate analyst it is unlikely that we should have had in him the author of the undulatory theory, the difficulties of which in its earlier stages made it unpalatable to Laplace, Poisson, and the most considerable French mathematicians. Having thought out for himself every one of the multifarious subjects with which he grappled, his writings have a striking force and ori¬ ginality, and his reports of the labours of others are almost invariably drawn from a study of their original works. His earliest principle was, that what one man has done another may accomplish; and one of the many respects in which he resembled his great predecessor Newton, was unbounded confidence in the powers of “ patient thought.” Not that he con¬ fined the desire to excel to purely intellectual matters","Young, Laplace, Newton","US,UY,FR",8,"United States,Uruguay,France","North America,South America,Europe"

"Hooke, in his Micrograyhia, asserts light to consist in “ quick, short, vibrating motion but his expla¬ nation of refraction by it is altogether erroneous; and his application of it to the doctrine of the colours of thin plates, though admitted by the candid Young to be an anticipation (unknown to him at the time) of his own, has in it no more than a germ of truth (like so many of Hooke’s ingenious hints, afterwards claimed by him as discoveries), which yet only ex¬ plains the fact on which it is founded by means of an additional and gratuitous assumption. The germ of truth in Hooke’s writings is this, that the colours in question depend upon a mixture of the light re¬ flected at the first surface of the thin plate with “ a kind of fainter ray ” propagated from the second sur¬ face backwards: the gratuitous assumption is, that “ this compound or duplicated pulse does produce on the retina the sensation of a yellowwhy it does so is not explained. This was in 16 64, before even New¬ ton was acquainted with the analysis of white light",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"Hooke’s idea that yellow, or any other colour, was the result of the conflict of pulses simultaneously reaching the eye, was an assertion, admissible, per¬ haps, at that time, as expressing a fact; but surely not a proof of interference producing reinforcement or annihilation of light, as taught by Young. I am not aware that Hooke ever even reiterated his opinions on this subject after Newton had analysed the phe¬ nomena experimentally, and shown that the colours of thin plates result from the superposition of bright and dark rings of different prismatic hues, each with its appropriate diameter. It was then apparent that colour was only an indirect effect of interference","Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"To this he added the assumption, that in refracting media, such as glass, the pulsations are retarded ; whereas in Newton’s theory, as is well known, the propagation of light is assumed to be fastest in dense media. The “law of the sines” in refraction, is de¬ duced as a consequence ; and one of the prettiest ap¬ plications made of it is to the phenomena of atmo¬ spherical refraction. But the most important features of the whole investigation are these two—(1), the 1 The reference of Arago, in his original eloge of Young, is to p. 387 of the Lectures, obviously by mistake.

"Young on the Undulatory Theory—Diffraction. (458.) —One hundred and ten years after the publication of Touns,°"" , A the undula- the Traite de la Lumiere ot Huygens, Dr Thomas tory theory Young re-opened the theory of light or “Physical Op—Diffrac- tics,” as he termed it. His experiments and reasonings tion* will be found in a series of papers in the Philoso¬ phical Transactions for 1800,1801,1802, and 1803.3 These memoirs are of no great length, and deserve the most careful study. They are perhaps among the clearest and plainest of Young’s writings, although blamed at the time for defects precisely the reverse","Young, Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"They are eminently marked by penetration, profound induction, and candour of argument. Starting from his studies in acoustics, the transition to optical questions is extremely gradual. Young was, cha¬ racteristically, a good musician in practice, as well as a profound one in theory, and his paper of 1799 is principally acoustical. In it he attaches conse¬ quence to showing that the divergence of sound from the direction of its emission is slower and less com¬ plete than it is commonly believed to be, and he applies the analogy to the existence of rays of light and definite shadows. In one short section he sums up the chief points of optical doctrine which lead him to prefer the theory of Huygens to that of Newton. Amongst the facts better explained by waves than corpus¬ cles, we find reckoned Inflection and the Colours of thin plates. But all this is stated in a very general way, evidently rather as a conclusion towards which his mind had for some time been tending, than as the result of demonstrative proofs. In his paper of 1801 the undulatory doctrine is methodically expounded in a series of propositions, accompanied by proofs. The accurate definition of shadows is shown to be possible and natural on that theory, as well as the usual phe¬ nomena of reflection, refraction, and total reflection","Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"1 Thus Newton writes in 1675 :—“ Were I to assume an hypothesis, it should be this, if propounded more generally, so as not to determine what light is farther than that it is something or other capable of exciting vibrations in the ether ; for thus it will become so general and comprehensive of other hypotheses as to leave little room for new ones to be invented.” And again, “ Do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations [of the retina], the least refrangible the largest ? ”—Birch’s Hist, of the Royal Society, quoted in Young’s Lectures, ii. 615, 617. Sir D. Brewster (Life of Newton, 1855, vol. i. p. 148) considers that some passages in the later editions of Newton’s OpJtcs show that he had departed from any theory of undulations","Young, Newton, Newton","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"The partial reflection which always accompanies re¬ fraction is strongly and justly insisted on as an ob¬ vious consequence of the theory, while it requires a sepai'ate hypothesis on Newton’s. But the chief weight is claimed for the evidence from the colours of heated surfaces, of thin plates, and of diffracted shadows, all of which the author explains by the mixture of two portions of light conveying to the same particle of ether at the same time either ac¬ cordant or opposing motions, thus redoubling or destroying the light. Of these the splendid iri¬ descent colours reflected by surfaces having fine equidistant lines drawn upon them, admit of the most elementary and striking explanation. The reflected image of a luminous point viewed in a mirror thus cut up by parallel lines, consists of one common reflection and numerous lateral images which are coloured, and in which the angles of inci¬ dence and reflection are not equal, thus contradicting one of the axioms of common optics. Young showed that the scattered waves of light recover the faculty of appearing when the surface of the plate is seen under such an angle that foreshortened intervals between the scratches amount severally to the length of one undulation or a multiple of it; for then the waves of light scattered by the reflecting surface will not come entire to the eye, but each will have a part systema¬ tically suppressed by the non-reflecting space of the groove, so that the remainders being nearly in one phase, concur in making a general impression. This experiment, therefore, literally presents us with the paradox that by suppressing half the light, the re¬ mainder is not suffered to be extinguished by it. The different colours appear reflected at different angles, because the obliquity must vary in order to be ac¬ commodated to their several wave-lengths, and each colour undergoes several repetitions corresponding to breadths representing the successive multiples of a wave-length","Newton, Of, Young","US,TR,UY",8,"United States,Turkey,Uruguay","North America,Asia,South America"
"A slip of card one-thirtieth of an inch wide being held in the sunbeam, its shadow was observed on the opposite wall or on a moveable screen. There were seen fringes of colour exterior to the shadow on each side, such as Newton had described, and on which Mr Brougham and others had made experi¬ ments. But besides these, the narrower and less conspicuous fringes seen in the interior of the shadow, and first described by Grimaldi, were found by Young to have this remarkable property, that they disap¬ peared the moment that the light passing either edge of the card was intercepted, whilst the exterior fringe was not at all affected by that circumstance excepting on the side where the light was stopped","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"Young at once perceived the significance of this (461.) admirable fact. The existence of light within the ^n^nds shadow at all, was evidently due to the bending ofexpiained",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"(464.) It might be supposed that Young’s discovery and Opposition its application excited the notice and applause of all to Young s persons interested in optics. This was very far from V16WS* x •/ being the case. Though he brought it several times in succession and in different forms before the Royal Society of London, there is no evidence, so far as I at present know, of his having then obtained a single ad¬ herent. Davy was no optician; Wollaston was too cautious to commit himself, though probably giving a tacit assent; Cavendish was aged, and besides had attended less to this subject than to most others ; Sir William Herschel had only lately taken up phy¬ sical optics, and that with reference to the qualities of the spectrum least connected with Young’s obser¬ vations. At the Royal Institution Young vainly at¬ tempted, in the elaborate course of lectures which he there delivered for two years (1801-3) on natural philosophy and the arts, to arouse a popular inte¬ rest in the unveiling of these mysteries. The ab¬ struseness of his discourses scared that mixed audi¬ ence, and his colleague Davy, in a letter, incidentally observes that Young would be satisfied if any one would even offer criticisms on his opinions. Criticism of a certain kind, however, he soon got in abundance","Young, Young, London, Young, Young, Young","UY,GB",8,"Uruguay,United Kingdom","South America,Europe"
"The Edinburgh Review, in its second number, under¬ took to crush at once the theory of Young and his reputation as a philosopher, and this (in singular contrast to its avowed principles), not by argument, but by an appeal to the weight of prescriptive autho¬ rity in favour of the Newtonian hypothesis, conclud¬ ing with an admonition to the Royal Society to cling to its old standards and old celebrities, and to save its Transactions from degenerating into volumes of miscellanies. This attack, paltry as it was, seriously prejudiced the reception, or even the dispassionate consideration of Young’s views. His anxious vin¬ dication put forth in a separate pamphlet was unread, and the doctrine of interference was first understood and relished in France ten years later","Young, Young","UY,FR",8,"Uruguay,France","South America,Europe"
"ing refrangibility of light, and which, when explained piete with- and reduced to calculation by Newton, so convin-out the cingly proved the truth of the doctrine of the compo- f °tCg^fg.e site nature of white light, was destined in the hands pence, of Young and of his successors to yield one of the most refined evidences of the extensive application of the doctrine of interference. The general fact of the ar¬ rangement of colour in the primary and secondary bows Newton accounted for. But the spurious or Spurious supernumerary bows occasionally seen within the bows‘ primary, and far more rarely beyond the secondary, consisting of reddish and greenish bands, remained unexplained. The brilliancy of any given portion of the rainbow depends upon the deviation of the sun’s rays by two refractions and one reflection, approach¬ ing to a limit which it cannot overpass. But except at this precise limit an amount of scattered light will reach the eye, which, though not reflected under the most favourable circumstances, yet is still sufficiently intense to be visible. This light must be composed, as Young showed, of two portions, entering the eye in the same direction, but which have pursued different paths within the drop, and which never coincide except at the extreme geometrical limit before mentioned","Newton, Young, Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"
"Then comes Dr Young, with his theory of interfe¬ rence and diffraction. This theory not only accounts for the spurious bows, but for the precise appearance of the principal ones, which, but for it, would have been different from what Newton supposed. Finally, after being canvassed for more than two centuries, the theory of Young is carried out into its rigorous consequences by Mr Airy1 and Professor Stokes2 (who must first invent a new mathematical method for the purpose) and illustrated by the ingenious ex¬ periments of M. Babinet and Professor Miller ;3 until at last we begin to believe that we understand this matter completely","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

I have done so because Young’s ex¬ planation wTas imperfect, not to say incorrect. But as it would be inconvenient to discuss the subject here, I shall briefly indicate its history and result. Dr Young expresses himself more obscurely in his paper of 1801 on this point than on any other, indicating three possible explanations. In 1803, however, he distinctly adopts the opinion that the periodical colours in question are due to the interference of direct light passing near the opaque edge with a por¬ tion of light very obliquely reflected from that edge; and he enters into calculations to show that such a theory represents sufficiently well Newton’s measures","Young, Newton, Young, Young, Newton","UY,US",8,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
"But it is unaccountable that Young should have been satisfied with the belief that the screens employed 1 Camb. Trans., vol. vi. (1838.) 2 Ibid., should in every case have reflected an appreciable quantity of light (or indeed any light at all) in the required direction. It might be conceivable in the case of a cylindrical wire or a cylindrical hair; but how could a film of gold-leaf or a slip of paper re¬ ceiving the light on its broad side furnish such a de¬ gree of oblique illumination ? It is wonderful that Young’s intuitive sense did not perceive that the por¬ tion of a luminiferous wave passing near an opaque edge, is deficient on one side of the interfering wave¬ lets which are necessary to make the boundary of the shadow definite, and to extinguish the laterally- spreading light. In short, he did not allow to Huy¬ gens’ principle (see art. 455) the full breadth of its application—a discovery made some years later by Fresnel, who has the credit of first explaining these exterior fringes","Young, Young, Huy","UY,BE",8,"Uruguay,Belgium","South America,Europe"

"Some of these cases were solved with great ingenuity by Fresnel, and compared with observation. The re¬ sult was extremely satisfactory. Yet it is curious to observe that Young’s explanation, if it had had a sufficient physical basis, leads to nearly similar re¬ sults. In the case of an indefinite opaque body with a straight edge, the illumination precisely at the boundary of the “geometrical” shadow is, on Fresnel’s theory, one-fourth of what it would have been were the body removed. Within this line the light dies away gradually, having no maxima or minima. Without it",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"a series of dark and light bands occur, which rapidly blend into a uniform illumination. The same theory leads to results as to the position of the interior bands which are also somewhat different from the simpler calculation of Young, and still more conformable to experience. Amongst the most singular of these re¬ sults is this (which is perfectly confirmed by obser¬ vation), that the shadow of a small round opaque body (as a spot of tin foil) is illuminated by a speck of diffracted light at its centre precisely as bright as if the disk were removed!

"this, can we talk of light as moving in straight lines only ] (469.) We must now advert to the peculiar and disadvan- Young's tageous manner in which Dr Young laid his faither farther re- researches before the world. The optical papers in the chiefly63 Philosophical Transactions, ending with 1803, were anony- the last which he published connected with his theory mous. in that work, although he continued to be Foreign Se¬ cretary until his death twenty-five years afterwards, and although during all that time he never ceased to extend and perfect his views on the subject of his predi¬ lection. The explanation of this paradox is to be found principally in the strictness with which he interpreted the allegiance which he owed to the medical profes¬ sion. He had determined to be a practical physician ; his early principles of action prevented him from doing anything by halves ; and all experience affirmed, that to gain confidence as a physician in the metropolis he must cultivate sparingly, and as it were by stealth, the studies of abstract science and of philology in which he delighted. Unquestionably he was also disgusted by the absence of one single supporter amongst the members of the great society referred to,—by the in¬ jurious petulance of the then popular critical journal, —and by the impossibility under which he laboured of communicating orally his knowledge to a general audience in an interesting and acceptable manner",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The result of all this was the suppression of many of his opinions, and the publication of others in so con¬ cealed and uninviting a form that they remained for years nearly buried and unknown to men of science. He contributed a series of articles on sub- Hls articles jects connected with light to the Quarterly Review ; in the and we may well smile at the abstruse and really ob- Iteview^ scure dissertations on detached points of science— often unmercifully loaded with algebra—thus inter¬ spersed with articles of popular criticism for the enter¬ tainment of the reading public. From some of these papers we may readily gather the soreness which he felt at the cold reception of his discoveries. Farther and still more important original speculations were contained in a series of anonymous papers (sixty- three in number) on a vast variety of subjects, both in science and philology, contributed to the Encyclopce- and Ency- dia Britannica. It is not in a work such as this that CJiritannica we usua^y look for the first publication of great and original views : the articles being anonymous could only very gradually attract notice by their intrinsic merit; and the obscurity of some of those written by Young rendered this difficult enough. But it is most fortunate that he was induced thus to write : many of his most original thoughts must have been lost but for these concealed repositories. In the articles in the Quarterly Review, for example, we watch with interest the impression which contemporary discoveries made upon his mind. The spheroidal wave of extraordinary refraction is explained by unequal elasticity of the crystal in different directions j1 the discovery of polar¬ ization by reflection is received with characteristic can¬ dour, as giving a temporary blow to the undulatory theory ;2 whilst in a later paper the cause of chromatic polarization is convincingly deduced from the prin¬ ciple of interferences, and in the space of two lines the peculiar coloured laminae occurring in Iceland spar, which had been noticed by several experi¬ menters, are accounted for.3 From about 1815 the optical discoveries of Young (470.) were so intimately connected with those of his younger Tlieoi7 °t friend and rival Fresnel, that it seems best to defer de- our account of them until we consider (in § 3 of this ferred to chapter) the peculiar researches of Fresnel, which § 3> ultimately rendered the phenomena of polarization the most impregnable position of the partizans of the undulatory theory. The first great step was the con¬ ception of transversevibrations of ether, as constituting polarization. This, as we shall see, was first pub¬ lished by Young. It is to be regretted that the tardy and imperfect publication of Fresnel’s memoirs on the one hand, and the resolution of Young to adhere to an anonymous and indirect mode of announcing his discoveries, on the other, render the history of the subject sometimes obscure. The correspondence between them, first fully published by Dr Peacock, throws some light upon it; but several important letters have not been recovered","Young, Young, Young, Young","UY,IS",8,"Uruguay,Iceland","South America,Europe"

To the petty persecutions with which he was assailed, it was owing that the health which the unbroken study of fifty years had not impaired, at length gave way, and he and death, died yet in the prime of intellect, the 10th May 1829, within a few months of his honoured asso¬ ciates and friends, Wollaston and Davy.

The phenomena of diffraction, or the coloured fringes which are seen in the interior of the shadows of opake bodies when illuminated by a minute source of light, attracted his attention as most proper for deciding the deli¬ cate question of the molecular or undulatory cha- Presnel’s racter of light. The results of his experiments were moii,me"" detailed in a memoir confided in the first place to his friend Arago, and by him communicated to the Institute of France (October 1815). This remark¬ able paper contained much which Dr Young had al¬ ready discovered, and the explanations of the experi¬ ments which it described, both new and old, by the theory of undulations, were common to both. Dr Young having anticipated the publication by at least a dozen years, there could be no question of pri¬ ority ; but it is equally certain that Fresnel was un¬ aware of what Young had done until it was pointed out to him by Arago. His memoir, which was pub¬ lished in great part in the Annales de Chimie for 1816, contains much which is interesting. The mode of observing the diffraction bands directly by means of a lens, without the intervention of a screen, was equally new and important. The observation that the interior fringes of the shadow of a narrow body, such as a wire, disappear when the light is intercepted on either side of the wire, leading to the conclusion that the union of the light from both sides is neces¬ sary for their occurrence, was (as we have seen) one of Young’s capital experiments. The explana¬ tion of Newton’s rings, by the interference of the light reflected from two adjacent surfaces, though partly anticipated by Hooke, was equally important. Nu¬ merous measures of the distances of the exterior diffraction bands from the geometrical shadow, as formed by homogeneous red light, are then given and compared with theory. Here Fresnel was on original ground. These accurate numerical comparisons, af¬ terwards pursued to a greater extent, constituted one of the most important bases of the new theory. In obtaining them he was materially aided by Arago, who, though considerably his senior, generously as¬ sisted him in every respect, and gave him the full ad¬ vantage of his station as a member of the Institute, and of his experience","Young, Young, Young, Young, Newton","UY,FR,US",8,"Uruguay,France,United States","South America,Europe,North America"

In Young’s this memoir he made an important step, by showing theory* that the exterior fringes in diffraction shadows do not depend (as Young had supposed) upon the interfer¬ ence of the direct light with that reflected at a great obliquity from the edge of the diffracting body, but from the interference of the different elementary un¬ dulations which proceed from the disturbed surface forming the front of the grand wave. Decomposing the front of the wave into small portions after the manner of Huygens, he computed the disturbance produced by the integral effect of the whole at a given point of the screen where the picture of the shadow fell and was submitted to examination, and he fouud that such integral effects have a periodic character, presenting points of maximum and minimum distur¬ bance, or of greatest and least illumination as we re¬ cede from the geometrical shadow. These distances being measured in homogeneous red light were found to agree with the results of an arduous computation, requiring, as will easily be seen, an intimate acquain¬ tance with the integral calculus and much skill in MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
(488.) Transverse vibrations —Young and Fres¬ nel,Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"Transverse Vibrations— Young and Fresnel. — Considerable obscurity hangs over the first publi¬ cation of this important discovery. A clear and impartial abstract of the facts will be found in the second volume of Dr WhewelTs History of the Inductive Sciences, and some further documentary evidence, including interesting letters which passed between Young and Fresnel, have more recently been published in the Life and Works of the for¬ mer, edited by Dr Peacock. The difficulty of appor¬ tioning the credit between Young and Fresnel partly arises from the unfortunate system of imperfect pub¬ lication, or non-publication, adopted on professional grounds by the former, and partly from the grievous delays imposed upon the latter by the opposition with which his opinions and experiments were received at the French Academy of Sciences. This continued to the very close of Fresnel’s career. His gi’eatest work was not published in the Memoirs of the Institute until six years after date; another was mislaid for above twenty years, and even the hardy friendship of Arago sometimes almost recoiled before the storm of opposition which the novelties of his associate were sure to excite in the minds of the dominant mathe¬ matical section. It is quite impossible to say pre¬ cisely at what period Young first imagined that the differences of oppositely polarized rays of light might be explained by perpendicularity in the directions of vibration of the ethereal molecules, which he compared to the vibrations of a cord in which the elementary movements are at right angles to the direction of wave- propagation. It seems evident that Young was not possessed of this idea in 1814, when he partly explained depolarization in a few pages of an article in the Quarterly Review. It is equally certain that he an¬ nounced it to Arago (with whom he became person¬ ally acquainted in 1816) in January, 1817; and that he then speaks of it as an idea which apparently had recently occurred to him, most probably since their interview.1 Arago and Fresnel had already, in 1816, made experiments demonstrating that rays oppositely polarized do not produce dark bands by their inter¬ ference, a memorable discovery, requiring very great nicety for its satisfactory proof, which, however, was completely attained. It was this observa¬ tion which (naturally) gave Fresnel the first idea of transverse vibrations, and it is much more than probable that Young worked out a similar solution of the great problem, in consequence of the account of these experiments which he received from Arago in the summer of 1816.2 Be this as it may, Young and Fresnel unquestionably imagined the theory se¬ parately, but Young first announced it, Fresnel being discouraged by the doubts of Arago, and by his awe of the Institute. As clearly, the experiment of non-interference was the first which gave a colour to so bold an assumption, and in the details of its ap¬ plication to double refraction Fresnel had the undi¬ vided merit. What is not least worthy of notice in the affair, is that neither of the amiable rivals (Young and Fresnel) ever published a word in disparagement of the other, nor a single unfriendly reclamation of priority","Young, Young, Young, Young, Young, Young, Young, Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The modifications of the state of polarization of light which takes place by reflection, was equally 1 “ I have also been reflecting on the possibility of giving an imperfect explanation of the affection of light which constitutes polarization, without departing from the genuine doctrine of undulation.” He then refers to “ a transverse vibration propagated in the direction of the radius, the motion of the particles being in a certain constant direction with respect to that radius; and this,” he adds, “ is a polarization.”—Young’s Miscell. Works, vol. i., p. 383",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"2 Peacock’s Life of Young, p. 390",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"Theory of Double Refraction.—The difficulty of accounting for double refraction did not consist in showing how a spheroidal wave might be pro¬ pagated. Young had already shown, in 1809, that it would result from supposing a lamellar arrange¬ ment of the crystalline molecules so that the ether was differently elastic in a direction parallel to the axis than in a plane or planes perpendicular to that line.1 Huygens had shown something similar in accounting for terrestrial atmospheric refraction",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The difficulty was, to account for two waves travel- ■FRESNEL. 905 ling at the same time through the same portion of matter with unequal velocities. The moment that the idea of molecular movement transverse to the line of propagation was admitted, it was easy to see that no contradiction was involved in the idea. Two waves might simultaneously travel in the same direc¬ tion, and through the same medium, provided the molecular displacements were in different planes. So happy a solution could hardly fail to strike such minds as those of Young and Fresnel with the impress of conviction. A closer analysis confirmed the proba¬ bility. Iceland spar (or rather the ether imprisoned within it) is conceived of as a medium of uniform elas¬ ticity in all planes perpendicular to the axis, but of a different and greater elasticity in any direction parallel to the axis. It is shown to result from this, that in the direction of the axis alone is the motion of light independent of the plane of the vibrations of which it is composed, and consequently no separation of rays occurs. When a ray moves parallel to what may by an analogy be called the equatoreal plane of the crystal, its undulation will, generally speaking, be resolved into two whose vibrations are parallel and perpendicular to that plane, and which travel with different velocities though in the same direction. If the ray take any other direction through the crystal, both the direction and velocity of the divided rays differ. The form of the extraordinary wave is exactly the spheroid of Huygens",Young,"IS,UY",8,"Iceland,Uruguay","Europe,South America"
"But what are wre to conclude concerning those crys- (493.) tals (of the discovery of which we shall speak in § 5)Theory of presenting two axes of double refraction ? Fresnel at^^!^ once assumed that the elasticities must in that case axes, vary in three rectangular directions, and he proceeded to calculate the manner of propagation of a wave through a medium thus constituted. I had proposed to attempt some explanation of the steps of his most ingenious and profound argument, but I find it incom¬ patible with the space at my disposal, and at any rate hardly to be apprehended without the use of symbols or figures. For these reasons I shall merely state the results. When the medium presents un¬ equal elasticities in three rectangular directions, the surface of the wave consists of two sheets each tra¬ velling with its peculiar velocity. But neither of these being spherical, the result cannot be expressed by the ordinary law of refraction. In tivo directions within the crystal, the wave surfaces coincide, or the two rays coalesce. These directions are evidently the optic axes, and the w^ave surface in their neigh¬ bourhood has very interesting geometrical and physical properties which have been elucidated by British philosophers, as will be noticed in another section. The true optical axes cannot exceed two, and when two of the three elasticities become equal, they merge into one. This is the 1 Young’s reasoning (Quarterb/ Review 1809, and Works, vol. i. p. 228) is based on an experiment by Chladni on the differing velocity with which sound is propagated in wood, depending on the direction of the fibres",Young,"UY,GB",8,"Uruguay,United Kingdom","South America,Europe"

Arago not only himself made some important optical discoveries in 1811 and the following years, but he was instrumental, as we have seen, in a very important degree, in calling forth the genius of Fresnel, and in obtaining a public recogni¬ tion of the labours of Young ; a service not the less wTorthy of note because of its eminently disinterested character.

"The substances he employed were principally sele- (505.) nite, rock-crystal, and mica. When plates of thePhenoinena first and last of these minerals, formed by their natu- ^a^°lar' ral cleavage, are placed in a beam of polarized light, and the light transmitted by them is then analyzed, by being passed through a doubly-refracting prism or thrown on a screen after reflection at the critical angle from glass, splendid colours are the resxdt. These colours vary with the thickness of the plate, with its in¬ clination to the incident light, and, what is most remark¬ able, they vary in intensity bymerely turning the plate of selenite round in its own plane. When only this last motion is made, there are two positions of the plate where no colour results, the light passing through un¬ changed; and these positions are at right angles to one another. At all intermediate angles colours appear, the light is said to be depolarized, and this depolarization is most complete when the plate is moved 45° from the difficulties inseparable from the biographical system which I have adopted. My intention was to have thrown together the labours of Malus, Fresnel, and Arago into one section. But having written the different portions separately, there seemed so much precision and facility of explanation to be derived from treating of them consecutively, that I sacrificed, in some degree, the biographical principle to that of systematic classification; placing under the name of Malus what referred to the empirical laws of double refraction; under that of Fresnel the doctrine of transverse vibration (though mainly due to Young); and under Arago the discoveries of \oung, Fresnel, Biot, and others, relative to the great subject of chromatic polarization, to which he gave the first impulse. The establishment of the undulatory theory, principally due to Young, Fresnel, and Arago, 1 have con¬ sidered as deserving of a more detailed and systematic treatment than almost any other of the numerous discoveries of which I have to speak in this Dissertation. I may add, that the biography of Arago not appearing in its alphabetical place in the En- cyclopczdia, M. Arago being still alive at the date of the publication of that part of the work, it has been incumbent upon me to enter into more details than I should otherwise have done. l See Chapter III., Art.

"The theory of this simple yet admirable experi¬ ment is one of the happiest examples of Fresnel’s mechanical explanation of double refraction. But it was not attained by a single step, nor effected by a single hand. Malus had observed the fact of depolarization, and the existence of perpendicular neutral axes in the crystalline plate. Arago added to this the knowledge of the phenomena of colour, which Sir David Brewster also observed indepen¬ dently somewhat later. He also invented a par¬ ticular theory to explain them by what he termed moveable 'polarization. But it wras not a success¬ ful effort. M. Biot assiduously studied the empi¬ rical laws of these periodic colours, and traced their dependence on the thickness of the interposed plate, according to a law similar to that of Newton’s rings. Young made an important step farther. He attributed the colour to the interference of the ordi¬ nary and extraordinary rays into which the incident light was divided on entering the crystalline plate ; and he showed by accurate calculation that the retar¬ dation of the slower-moving of the two rays during their passage through the plate, did in fact produce the difference of phase necessary for developing the tints observed by their reunion on leaving the plate, according to the usual laws of interference; and he showed that this theory coincided with M. Biot’s rules.1 But even this was not enough to explain the facts. It wras not clear why the colours due to doubly- refracting plates should not be seen without reaching the eye through an analyzer, or calc-spar prism. To Arago and Fi'esnel jointly we owe the important reply to this difficulty, which in fact forced upon the latter the idea of transversal vibrations. Their joint experiments (mentioned in the last section, art. 488), had shown that oppositely polarized rays cannot in¬ terfere unless they have, first, a common origin and a common plane of polarization; and, secondly, unless they be reduced to a common plane of polaiization (that is, analyzed) before falling on the eye or the screen : so that the theory of the colours of crystal¬ lized plates is, briefly, as follows :— Polarized light is represented by transverse vibra¬ tions of ether, the particles moving all in one plane","Newton, Young","US,UY",8,"United States,Uruguay","North America,South America"

"Foucault (the author of the admirable experiment with the pendulum, demonstrating the earth’s mo¬ tion5), who, by an ingenious combination of fixed and revolving mirrors, succeeded in 1850 in demonstrating the retardation of light in a tube of water only 6^ feet long, and with a velocity of rotation of the move- able mirror not exceeding 200 turns in a second (a ra¬ pidity four times less than had already been obtained by Mr Wheatstone). The rotation was produced by means of the Sirene of M. Cagniard de la Tour, acting by steam. The velocity was thus raised to 1000 revolutions. It was afterwards, however, carried by MM. Fizeau and Breguet to 2000 revolutions. It will be understood, from the account of the method, as applied to the measurement of the velocity of elec¬ tricity, in another chapter, that the retardation is shown by the displacement of the image of a minute object seen through the water, relatively to the image of the same object seen in air. If light moves faster in water (as Newrton imagined), the displacement of the water-image will be (let us say) to the right; but if slower (as Huygens and Young believed), it will be to the left. The calculated displacement, with 800 revolutions in a second, was '004 inch on the first supposition, and ‘003 in the opposite direction in the second, quantities easily visible with a high magnifying power. The result, as has been stated, confirmed Arago’s original experiment of 1815 on the displacement of the interference fringes",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"The special pleader is too often visible, and even the occasional sacrifices of the strong spirit of nation¬ ality by which he was commonly actuated, to some chivalrous adjustment of the rights of discovery, do not always carry conviction to the mind of the reader. The Eloge of Watt, probably the most po¬ pular, appears to us far from being the best of these biographies. Those of Sir W. Herschel and of Dr Young are ably executed, and display much research and candour",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"To meteorology he has been a valuable contributor, having discussed in an able paper the law of the distribution of temperature over the globe, and pointed out the near coincidence of two regions or centres of greatest cold in the northern hemi- sphei’e, with the magnetic poles. His papers are so numerous, and their variety is so great, as to render an enumeration, even of those containing what may reasonably be termed discoveries, impossible within our limits. Few persons have made with their own eyes so vast a number of independent observations ; few have ever observed better, or re¬ corded their observations more faithfully. He has discovered (as we have partly seen) a multitude of laws of phenomena of the greatest importance in the construction of a theory, but he has not been forward in proposing such a theory. Neither the moveable polarization of Biot, nor the transverse undulations of Young and Fresnel, received his cordial assent",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"Generally speaking, he has been favourable to a cor¬ puscular theory of light, without, however, attempting to render the Newtonian view mechanically consistent with the astonishing variety of complex phenomena which he aided in discovering, and which would evi¬ dently require it (to say the least) to be completely remodelled. His scientific glory is different in kind from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization, of biaxal crystals, of op¬ tical mineralogy, and of double refraction by com¬ pression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America

Its origin in the seventeenth century was unattended with sympathy or success. It received little support, and was well nigh forgotten for more than an hundred years: it was then resumed (we might almost say re-invented) in England, but it remained unpopular and almost unknown until re-echoed from a foreign land ; while in France itself the views of Fresnel were (with one or two exceptions) as little appreciated as those of Young had been in England",Young,"FR,UY",8,"France,Uruguay","Europe,South America"

"porary, Dr Thomas Young (than whom no man was ever a less indiscriminate eulogist), that Davy’s researches were “ more splendidly successful than any which have ever before illustrated the physical sciences, in any of their departments and that the contents of the Bakerian Lectures, in particular, “ are as much superior to those of Newton’s Optics, as the Principia are superior to these or any other human work.” 2 A not less impartial tribute to his superla¬ tive genius has been yielded by M. Dumas, who, if I mistake not, has described Davy as being the ablest and most successful chemist who ever lived.

But two others, less noticed at the time, ivere also among her worthiest sons. These were Young and Wollaston. They were all three nearly contemporaries ; all lived on good terms with one an¬ other, and united in promoting natural knowledge in their several spheres. Young was Davy’s early, though less successful colleague at the Royal Institu¬ tion ; and Wollaston wras joint-secretary with him to the Royal Society. All three were originally educated for the medical profession, and they all abandoned it for the pursuit of science. Not the least singular coincidence was in the periods of their deaths, which all occurred within the space of six months","Young, Young",UY,8,Uruguay,South America
"Our notice of Young, the first optical philosopher of his age, belongs to another chapter. Wollaston, though an original observer in nearly every branch of exact science, considered himself as a chemist; and his observations on Electricity were amongst his first and best contributions to science. After the impulse given to discovery by the invention of the Pile, and the proof of the decomposition of water, Wollaston undertook to compare critically the effects of galvanic and frictional electricity—a task of some nicety, and of very great importance at a time when it could hardly be considered as certain that these agents were not specifically different. By methods peculiarly his own, he produced decomposi¬ tion, accompanied with separation of the elements at the respective poles by means of common electricity",Young,UY,8,Uruguay,South America

Davy, then at the height and the^ of his reputation, a copy of a set of notes taken at his stitution” loci'111,68* desiring his assistance “ to escape from trade, and enter into the service of science.” To the credit of the popular and distinguished chemist, he gave Mr Faraday a courteous answer, and appointed him as chemical assistant in the Laboratory of the Royal In¬ stitution in March 1813. Leaving England to travel in the autumn of the same year, Davy engaged Mr Faraday to accompany him as secretary and scien¬ tific assistant; they returned in April 1815, and from that time to the present Mr Faraday has been constantly engaged in the scientific business of the Royal Institution, which is as completely associated with his numerous and splendid dis¬ coveries as Cambridge is with those of Newton, and Slough with those of the elder Herschel. By a rare, perhaps unexampled good fortune, that esta¬ blishment, founded principally for the promotion of original research and the promulgation of dis¬ coveries, has been indebted during the first fifty years of its existence to the talents of two men only, for a succession of new scientific truths which might have done credit to a whole academy; indeed, if to the names of Davy and Mr Faraday we add that of Young, who here first promulgated the doc¬ trines of the Interference of Light, there is scarcely an academy in Europe which has within the same period added so extensively to our choicest stock of original science","March, Cambridge, Newton, Slough, Young","GB,US,UY",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay","Europe,North America,South America"
"To Major-General Edward Sabine, of the Royal Artillery, is mainly due the judicious management of these magnetic explorations, and the speedy and skilful publication of their interesting results. During the course of an active life he has enjoyed opportunities of making extensive observations with magnetic ap¬ paratus and with the pendulum (238) throughout a great range of latitude. His experiments (carried on principally between the years 1819 and 1826) were made in Brazil, the coast of Guinea, Spitzbergen, and Arctic America. His observations on magnetic inten¬ sity are particularly valuable, and first indicated the position of a region of maximum intensity in North America considerably to the south of the magnetic pole as indicated by the dipping needle. To him we also owe a valuable Intensity Chart of the Globe, and a Magnetic Survey of the British Islands, pub¬ lished in the reports of the British Association for 1836 and the two following years",,"BR,GN",8,"Brazil,Guinea","South America,Africa"
