"Of these objections a very obvious one is sug¬ gested by a consideration, of which D’Alembert himself has taken notice,—that the three facul¬ ties to which he refers the whole operations of the understanding are perpetually blended to¬ gether in their actual exercise, insomuch that there is scarcely a branch of human knowledge which does not, in a greater or less degree, furnish employment to them all. It may be said, indeed, that some pursuits exercise and in¬ vigorate particular faculties more than others; that the study of History, for example, al¬ though it may occasionally require the aid both of Reason and of Imagination, yet chiefly fur¬ nishes occupation to the Memory; and that this is sufficient to justify the logical division of our mental powers as the ground-work of a corre¬ sponding Encyclopedical classification.2 This, however, will be found more specious than solid",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"things as they are in themselves knowahle; actions as they depend on us, in order to hap¬ piness ; and the right use of signs, in order to knowledge; being toto ccelo different, they seem¬ ed to me to he the three great provinces of the intellectual world, wholly separate and distinct one from another.”1 From the manner in which Mr Locke ex¬ presses himself in the above quotation, he ap¬ pears evidently to have considered the division proposed in it as an original idea of his own; and yet the truth is, that it coincides exactly with what was generally adopted by the philo¬ sophers of ancient Greece. “ The ancient Greek Philosophy,” says Mr Smith, “ was divid¬ ed into three great branches, Physics, or Natural Philosophy; Ethics, or Moral Philosophy; and Logic. This general division,” he adds, “ seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.” Mr Smith afterwards observes, in strict conformity to Locke’s definitions (of which, however, he seems to have had no recollection when he wrote this passage), “ That, as the human mind and the Deity, in whatever their essence may he supposed to consist, are parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too, productive of the most important effects, what¬ ever was taught in the ancient schools of Greece, concerning their nature, made a part of the sys¬ tem of physics.”2 * Dr Campbell, in his Philosophy of Rhetoric has borrowed from the Grecian schools the same very extensive use of the words physics and physiology, which he employs as synonymous terms; comprehending under this title “ not merely Natural History, Astronomy, Geography, Mechanics, Optics, Hydrostatics, Meteorology, Medicine, Chemistry, hut also Natural Theology and Psychology, which,” he observes, “ have been, in his opinion, most unnaturally disjoined from Physiology by philosophers.” “ Spirit,” he adds, “ which here comprises only the Supreme Being and the human soul, is surely as much in¬ cluded under the notion of natural object as body is; and is knowahle to the philosopher purely in the same way, by observation and experience.”5 A similar train of thinking led the late cele¬ brated M. Turgot to comprehend under the name of Physics, not only Natural Philosophy (as that phrase is understood by the Newtonians), but Metaphysics, Logic, and even History.4 Notwithstanding all this weight of authority, it is difficult to reconcile one’s self to an arrange¬ ment which, while it classes with Astronomy, with Mechanics, with Optics, and with Hy¬ drostatics, the strikingly contrasted studies of Natural Theology and of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, disunites from the two last the far more congenial sciences of Ethics and of Logic. The human mind, it is true, as well as the material world which surrounds it, forms a part of the great system of the Universe; hut is it possible to conceive two parts of the same whole more completely dissimilar, or rather more diametrically opposite, in all their charac- teristical attributes ?

"For us who have been accustomed, from our in¬ fancy, to the use of hooks, it is not easy to form an adequate idea of the disadvantages which those laboured under, who had to acquire the whole of their knowledge through the medium of universities and schools;—blindly devoted as the generality of students must then have been to the peculiar opinions of the teacher who first unfolded to their curiosity the treasures of lite¬ rature and the wonders of science. Thus error was perpetuated; and, instead of yielding to time, acquired additional influence in each suc¬ cessive generation.* In modern times, this in¬ fluence of names is, comparatively speaking, at an end. The object of a public teacher is no longer to inculcate a particular system of dog¬ mas, but to prepare his pupils for exercising their own judgments; to exhibit to them an outline of the different sciences, and to suggest subjects for their future examination. The few attempts to establish schools and to found sects, have all, after perhaps a temporary success, proved abortive. Their effect, too, during their short continuance, has been perfectly the reverse of that of the schools of antiquity; for where¬ as these were instrumental, on many occasions, in establishing and diffusing error in the world, the founders of our modern sects, by mixing up important truths with their own peculiar tenets, and by disguising them under the garb of a tech¬ nical phraseology, have fostered such prejudices against themselves, as have blinded the public mind to all the lights they were able to commu¬ nicate. Of this remark a melancholy illustra¬ tion occurs, as M. Turgot long ago predicted, in the case of the French Economists; and many examples of a similar import might be pro¬ duced from the history of science in our coun¬ try; more particularly from the history of the va¬ rious medical and metaphysical schools which successively rose and fell during the last century",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"19 den impulse which the human mind had just re¬ ceived. The same century which the invention of printing and the revival of letters have made for ever memorable, was also illustrated by the dis¬ covery of the New World, and of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope;—events which may be justly regarded as fixing a new era in the political and moral history of mankind, and which still continue to exert a growing influence over the general condition of our species. “ It is an era,” as Raynal observes, “ which gave rise to a revolution, not only in the commerce of nations, but in the manners, industry, and government of the world. At this period new connections were formed by the inhabitants of the most distant regions, for the supply of wants which they had never before experienced. The productions of climates situated under the equa¬ tor, were consumed in countries bordering on the pole; the industry of the north was trans¬ planted to the south; and the inhabitants of the west were clothed with the manufactures of the east; a general intercourse of opinions, laws and customs, diseases and remedies, virtues and vices, was established among men.” <£ Every thing,” continues the same writer, “ has changed, and must yet change more. But it is a question, whether the revolutions that are past, or those which must hereafter take place, have been, or can he, of any utility to the hu¬ man race. Will they add to the tranquillity, to the enjoyments, and to the happiness of man¬ kind ? Can they improve our present state, or do they only change it ?” I have introduced this quotation, not with the design of attempting at present any reply to the very interesting question with which it con¬ cludes, hut merely to convey some slight notion of the political and moral importance of the events in question. I cannot, however, forbear to remark, in addition to Raynal’s eloquent and impressive summary, the inestimable treasure of new facts which these events have furnished for illustrating the versatile nature of man, and the history of civil society. In this respect (as Ba¬ con has well observed) they have fully verified the Scripture prophecy, multi pertransibunt et au- gebitur scientia ; or, in the still more emphatical words of our English version, “ Many shall go to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.”1 The same prediction may be applied to the gra¬ dual renewal, (in proportion as modern govern¬ ments became effectual in securing order and tranquillity) of that intercourse between the dif¬ ferent states of Europe, which had, in a great measure, ceased during the anarchy and turbu¬ lence of the middle ages",,"IN,UK",8,"India,N/A","Asia,N/A"
"The consequences of the prevalence of such a creed among the rulers of mankind were such as might he expected. “ Infamous crimes, as¬ sassinations, and poisonings (says a French his¬ torian), prevailed more than ever. They were thought to he the growth of Italy, where the rage and weakness of the opposite factions con¬ spired to multiply them. Morality gradually disappeared, and with it all security in the inter¬ course of life. The first principles of duty were obliterated by the joint influence of atheism and of superstition.”1 And here, may I he permitted to caution my readers against the common error of confound¬ ing the double doctrine of Machiavelian politi¬ cians, with the benevolent reverence for establish¬ ed opinions, manifested in the noted maxim of Fontenelle,—“ that a wise man, even when his hand was full of truths, would often content himself with opening his little finger.” Of the advocates for the former, it may he justly said, that “ they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil;” well knowing, if I may borrow the words of Bacon, “ that the open day-light doth not show the masks and mummeries, and triumphs of the world, half so stately as candle-light.” The philosopher, on the other hand, who is duly impressed with the latter, may be compared to the oculist, who, after removing the cataract of his patient, pre¬ pares the still irritable eye, by the glimmering dawn of a darkened apartment, for enjoying in safety the light of day.® Machiavel is well known to have been, at bottom, no friend to the priesthood; and his character has been stigmatized by many of the order with the most opprobrious epithets. It is nevertheless certain, that to his maxims the royal defenders of the Catholic faith have been indebted for the spirit of that policy which they have uniformly opposed to the innovations of the Reformers.

"1 How strange is the following misrepresentation of Fontenelle’s fine and deep saying, by the comparatively coarse hand of the Baron de Grimm ! “ II disoit, que s’il eut tenu la verite dans ses mains comme un oiseau, il 1’auroit etouffee, tant il regardoit le plus beau present du ciel inutile et dangereux pour le genre humain.”—(Memoires Historiqnes, &c. par le Baron de Grimm. Londres, 1814. Tome I. p. 340.) Of the complete inconsistency of this statement, not only with the testimony of his most authentic biographers, hut with the general tenor both of his life and writings, a judgment may be formed from an expression of B’Alembert, in his very ingenious and philosophical parallel between Fontenelle and La Motte. “ Tous deux ont porte trop loin leur revolte ddcidee, quoique douce en apparence, contre les dieux et les lois du Pamasse ; mais la libertd des opinions de la Motte semble tenir plus intimement a 1’interet personnel qu’il avoit de les soutenir; et la liberte des opinions de Fontenelle a V inter et general, peut-ltre quelquefois mal entendu, qu'il prenoit au progres de la raison dans tous les genres. What follows may be regarded in the light of a comment on the maxim above quoted : “ La finesse de la Motte est plus developpee, celle de Fontenelle laisse plus a deviner a son lecteur. La Motte, sans jamais en trop dire, n’oublie de ce que son sujet lui presente, met habilement tout en oeuvre, et semble craindre perdre par des reticences trop subtiles quelqu’un de ses avantages ; Fontenelle, sans jamais etre obscur, excepte pour ceux qui ne meritent pas meme qu’on soit clair, se manage a la fois et le plaisir de sous-entendre, et celui d’esperer qu’il sera pleine- ment entendu par ceux qui en sont dignes.”—Eloge de la Motte",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

"Art. 2.) Of his Political Aphorisms, which form the third part of his treatise on Morals, a sufficient idea for our purpose is conveyed by the concluding corollary, “ Probitas custodit regem populosque; non autem indocta Machiavellistarum astu- tia.” On the other hand, Campanella’s works abound with immoralities and extravagancies far exceeding those of Hobbes. In his idea of a pei'fect commonwealth (to which he gives the name of Civitas Solis), the impurity of his imagi¬ nation, and the unsoundness of his judgment, are equally conspicuous. He recommends, under certain regulations, a com¬ munity of women ; and, in every thing connected with procreation, lays great stress on the opinions of astrologers",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Contemporary with these great men was Bo- din (or Bodinus),8 an eminent French lawyer, who appears to have been one of the first that united a philosophical turn of thinking with an extensive knowledge of jurisprudence and of history. His learning is often ill digested, and his conclusions still oftener rash and unsound; yet it is hut justice to him to acknowledge, that, in his views of the philosophy of law, he has approached very nearly to some leading ideas of Lord Bacon;3 while, in his refined combina¬ tions of historical facts, he has more than once struck into a train of speculation, hearing a strong resemblance to that afterwards pursued by Montesquieu.4 Of this resemblance, so re¬ markable an instance occurs in his chapter on the moral effects of Climate, and on the atten¬ tion due to this circumstance by the legislator, that it has repeatedly subjected the author of The Spirit of Laws (but in my opinion without any good reason) to the imputation of plagia¬ rism.5 A resemblance to Montesquieu, still more honourable to Bodinus, may be traced in their common attachment to religious as well as to civil liberty. To have caught, in the six¬ teenth century, somewhat of the philosophical spirit of the eighteenth, reflects less credit on the force of his mind, than to have imbibed, in the midst of the theological controversies of his age, those lessons of mutual forbearance and charity, which a long and sad experience of the fatal effects of persecution has to this day so im¬ perfectly taught to the most enlightened nations of Europe",Of,"TR,FR",8,"Turkey,France","Asia,Europe"
"One of the most extraordinary of these, is his elaborate argument to prove, that, in a w^ell con¬ stituted state, the father should possess the right of life and death over his children ;—a paradox which forms an unaccountable contrast to the general tone of humanity which characterizes his opinions. Of the extent of his credulity on the subject of witchcraft, and of the deep horror with which he regarded those who affected to be sceptical about the reality of that crime, he has left a lasting memorial in a learned and curious volume entitled Demonomanie;5 * * while the ec- 1 Book iv. chap, iii The book from which this quotation is taken was published only twenty-three years after the mur¬ der of Servetus at Geneva ; an event which leaves so deep a stain on the memory not only of Calvin, but on that ot the milder and more charitable Melanchthon.

"Of this apparent inconsistency, Bodinus dues not furnish a solitary example. The same re¬ mark may be extended, in a greater or less de¬ gree, to most of the other celebrated names hitherto mentioned. Melanchthon, as appears from his letters, was an interpreter of dreams, and a caster of nativities; * and Luther not only sanctioned, by his authority, the popular fables about the sexual and prolific intercourse of Satan with the human race, but seems to have serious¬ ly believed that he had himself frequently seen the arch enemy face to face, and held arguments with him on points of theology.5 Nor was the study of the severer sciences, on all occasions, an effectual remedy against such illusions of the imagination. The sagacious Kepler was an as¬ trologer and a visionary ; and his friend Tycho Brahe, the Prince of Astronomers, kept an idiot in his service, to whose prophecies he listened as revelations from above.4 During the long night of Gothic barbarism, the intellectual world had again become, like the primitive earth, “ with¬ out form and voidthe light had already ap¬ peared ; ii and God had seen the light that it was goodbut the time was not yet come to “ di¬ vide it from the darkness.”5 In the midst of the disorders, both political and moral, of that unfortunate age, it is pleasing to observe the anticipations of brighter pro¬ spects, in the speculations of a few individuals",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"* See the Life of Tycho Brahe, by Gassendi. _ _ 5 I have allotted to Bodin a larger space than may seem due to his literary importance; but the truth is, I know of no political writer, of the same date, whose extensive and various and discriminating reading appears to me to have contri¬ buted more to facilitate and to guide the researches of his successors, or whose references to ancient learning have been more frequently transcribed without acknowledgment. Of late his works have fallen into very general^ neglect; otherwise it is impossible that so many gross mistakes should be current about the scope and spirit of his principles. By many he has been mentioned as a zealot for republican forms of government, probably for no better reason than that he chose to call his book a Treatise De Republica; whereas, in point of fact, he is uniformly a warm and able advocate for monarchy ; and, although no friend to tyranny, has, on more than one occasion, carried his monarchical principles to a very blameable ex¬ cess JSee, in particular, chapters fourth and fifth of the Sixth Book.) On the other hand, Grouvelle, a writer of some note, has classed Bodin with Aristotle, as an advocate for domestic slavery. “ The reasonings of both,” he says, “ are re¬ futed by Montesquieu.” (De VAutorite, de Montesquieu dans la Revolution presente. Paris, 1789.) _ Whoever has the curiosity to compare Bodin and Montesquieu together, will be satisfied, that, on this point, their sentiments were exactly the same; and that, so far from refuting Bodin, Montesquieu has borrowed from him more than one argument in support of his general conclusion. ,","Of, Paris","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"
"3 Dr Barrow, in one of his mathematical lectures, speaks of Ramus in terms far too contemptuous. “ Homo, ne quid gravius dicam, argutulus et dicacnlus.""—“ Sane vix indignationi meae tempero, quin ilium accipiam pro suo merito, regeram- que validius in ejus caput, quae contra veteres jactat convicia.” Had Barrow confined this censure to the weak and arro¬ gant attacks made by Ramus upon Euclid (particularly upon Euclid’s definition of Proportion), it would not have been more than Ramus deserved ; but it is evident he meant to extend it also to the more powerful attacks of the same reformer upon the logic of Aristotle. Of these there are many which may be read with profit even in the present times. I select one passage as a specimen, recommending it strongly to the consideration of those logicians who have lately stood forward as advocates for Aristotle’s abecedarian demonstrations of the syllogistic rules. “ In Aristotelis arte, unius pnecepti uni- cum exemplum est, ac ssepissime nullum : sed unico et singular! exemplo non potest artifex effici; pluribus opus est et dissimilibus. Et quidem, ut Aristotelis exempla tantummodo non falsa sint, qualia tamen sunt ? Omne 6 est a : omne c est b : ergo omne c est a.

Rami pro Philosophica Parisiensis Academia; Disciplina Oratio, 1550). If these strictures should be thought too loose and declamatory, the reader may consult the fourth chapter (De Conversionibus) of the seventh Look of Ramus’s Dialectics, where the same charge is urged, in my opinion, with irresistible force of argument","Euclid, Euclid, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"The dialogue of our illustrious countryman Buchanan, De Jure Regni apud Scotos, though occasionally disfigured by the keen and indig¬ nant temper of the writer, and by a predilection (pardonable in a scholar warm from the schools of ancient Greece and Rome) for forms of policy unsuitable to the circumstances of modern Europe, bears, nevertheless, in its general spirit, a closer resemblance to the political philosophy of the eighteenth century, than any composition which had previously appeared. The ethical paradoxes afterwards inculcated by Hobbes as the ground-work of his slavish theory of govern¬ ment, are anticipated and refuted, and a power¬ ful argument is urged against that doctrine of Utility which has attracted so much notice in our times. The political reflections, too, inci¬ dentally introduced by the same author in his History of Scotland, bear marks of a mind worthy of a better age than fell to his lot.

"In Bacon’s scattered hints on topics connected with the Philosophy of the Mind, strictly so called, nothing is more remarkable than the pre¬ cise and just ideas they display of the proper aim of this science. He had manifestly re¬ flected much and successfully on the operations of his own understanding, and had studied with uncommon sagacity the intellectual characters of others. Of his reflections and observations on both subjects, he has recorded many im¬ portant results, and has in general stated them without the slightest reference to any physiolo¬ gical theory concerning their causes, or to any analogical explanations founded on the caprices of metaphorical language. If, on some occasions, he assumes the existence of animal spirits, as the medium of communication between Soul and Body, it must be remembered, that this was then the universal belief of the learned; and that it was at a much later period not less confidently avowed by Locke. Nor ought it to be over¬ looked (I mention it to thecredit of both authors), 1 “ Cum mumlus sensibilis sit anima rational! dignitate inferior, videtur Potsis haec humanae naturae largiri quae historia denegat; atque animo umbris rerum utcunque satisfacere, cum solida haberi non possint.

"43 which runs through the philological materialism of Mr Horne Tooke. It is probable, indeed, that this last author borrowed it, at second¬ hand, from a hint in Locke’s Essay; but it is repeatedly stated by Hobbes, in the most ex¬ plicit and confident terms. Of this idea (than which, in point of fact, nothing can be imagin¬ ed more puerile and unsound), Mr Tooke’s etymologies, when he applies them to the solu¬ tion of metaphysical questions, are little more than an ingenious expansion, adapted and level¬ led to the comprehension of the multitude",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"The Intellectual System of Cudworth embraces a field much wider than his treatise of Immu¬ table Morality. The latter is particularly direct¬ ed against the ethical doctrines of Hobbes, and of the Antinomians; but the former aspires to tear up by the roots all the principles, both phy¬ sical and metaphysical, of the Epicurean philo¬ sophy. It is a work, certainly, which reflects much honour on the talents of the author, and still more on the boundless extent of his learn¬ ing ; but it is so ill suited to the taste of the present age, that, since the time of Mr Harris and Dr Price, I scarcely recollect the slightest reference to it in the writings of our British me¬ taphysicians. Of its faults (beside the general disposition of the author to discuss questions placed altogether beyond the reach of our facul¬ ties), the most prominent is the wild hypothesis of a plastic nature ; or, in other words, 44 of a vital and spiritual, but unintelligent and neces¬ sary agent, created by the Deity for the execu- other thoughts laid open before it, and variety of knowledge, logical, mathematical, and moral, displayed ; but also clearly read the divine wisdom and goodness in every page of this great volume, as it were written in large and legible characters.” I do not pretend to be an adept in the philosophy of Kant; but I certainly think I pay it a very high compliment, when I suppose, that, in the Critic of Pure Reason, the leading idea is somewhat analogous to what is so much better expressed in the foregoing passage. To Kant it was probably suggested by the following very acute and decisive remark of Leibnitz on Locke’s Essay : “ Nempe, nihil est in intellectu, quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi ipse intellectus.” In justice to Aristotle, it may be here observed, that, although the general strain of his language is strictly conformable to the scholastic maxim just quoted, he does not seem to have altogether overlooked the important exception to it pointed out by Leibnitz.

"“ If we scan,” says he, “ the particular nature, and search into the original causes of the seve¬ ral kinds of naughty dispositions in our souls, and of miscarriages in our lives, we shall find inordinate self-love to be a main ingredient, and a common source of them all; so that a divine of great name had some reason to affirm,—that original sin (or that innate distemper from which men generally become so very prone to evil, and averse to good), doth consist in self-love, dispo¬ sing us to all kinds of irregularity and excess.” In another passage, the same author expresses himself thus:—“ Reason dictateth and pre- scribeth to us, that we should have a sober re¬ gard to our true good and welfare ; to our best interests and solid content; to that which (all things being rightly stated, considered, and com¬ puted) will, in the final event, prove most bene¬ ficial and satisfactory to us: a self-love working in prosecution of such things, common sense cannot hut allow and approve.” Of these two opposite and irreconcileable opi¬ nions, the latter is incomparably the least wide of the truth; and accordingly Mr Locke, and his innumerable followers, both in England and on the Continent, have maintained, that virtue and an enlightened self-love are one and the same. I shall afterwards find a more conve¬ nient opportunity for stating some objections to the latter doctrine, as well as to the former. I have quoted the two passages here, merely to show the very little attention that had been paid, at the era in question, to ethical science, by one of the most learned and profound divines of his age. This is the more remarkable, as his works everywhere inculcate the purest lessons of practical morality, and evince a singular acuteness and justness of eye in the observation of human character. Whoever compares the views of Barrow, when he touches on the theory of morals, with those opened about fifty years afterwards by Dr Butler, in his Discourses on Human Nature, will be abundantly satisfied, that, in this science, as well as in others, the progress of the philosophical spirit during the intervening period was not inconsiderable",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

With all the ingenuity displayed in them, they cannot be considered as accessions of much value to science; and the long period since elapsed, during which no at¬ tempt has been made to turn them to any prac¬ tical use, affords of itself no slight presumption against the solidity of the project",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"By setting the example of submitting every thing to the examination of a severe logic, they have dissipated the prejudices which had too long reigned in the sciences, and which the strongest minds of the preceding centuries had not been able to resist. They have constantly opposed to empiricism a mass of knowledge, against which the errors adopted by the vulgar, with an enthusiasm which, in former times, would have perpetuated their empire, have spent their force in vain. In a word, it has been in their bosoms that those grand theories have been conceived, which, although far exalted by their generality above the reach of the multitude, are for this very reason entitled to special encourage¬ ment, from their innumerable applications to the phenonema of nature, and to the practice of the arts.”® In confirmation of these judicious remarks, it 1 Throughout the whole of this Discourse, I have avoided touching on the discussions which, on various occasions, have arisen with regard to the theory of government, and the comparative advantages or disadvantages of different political forms. Of the scope and spirit of these discussions it would be seldom possible to convey a just idea, without entering into details of a local or temporary nature, inconsistent with my general design. In the present circumstances of the world, besides, the theory of government (although, in one point of view, the most important of all studies) seems to possess a very subordinate interest to inquiries connected with political economy, and with the fundamental principles of legisla¬ tion. What is it, indeed, that renders one form of government more favourable than another to human happiness, but the superior security it provides for the enactment of wise laws, and for their impartial and vigorous execution ? These considerations will sufficiently account for my passing over in silence, not only the names of Needham, of Sidney, and of Milton, but that of Harrington, whose Oceana is justly regarded as one of the boasts of English literature, and is pronounced by Hume to be “ the only valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offered to the public.”—Essays and Trea¬ tises, Yol.

At present, I shall only observe, that, in these fugitive and now neglected tracts, are to be found the first rudiments of that science of Political Economy, which is justly considered as the boast of the present age; and which, although the aid of learning and philosophy was necessary to rear it to maturity, may he justly said to have had its cradle in the Royal Exchange of London","Of, London","UK,TR,GB",8,"N/A,Turkey,United Kingdom","N/A,Asia,Europe"
"The minds of the most serious men, all over Christendom, must have been then unsettled in an extraordinary degree; and where any pre¬ disposition to scepticism existed, every external circumstance must have conspired to cherish and confirm it. Of the extent to which it was car¬ ried, about the same period, in England, some judgment may be formed from the following de¬ scription of a Sceptic by a winter not many years posterior to Montaigne",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"He would be wholly a Christian, but that he is something of an Atheist; and wholly an Atheist, but that he is partly a Christian; and a perfect Heretic, but that there are so many to distract him. He finds reason in all opinions, truth in none; indeed, the least reason perplexes him, and the best will not satisfy him. He finds doubts and scruples better than resolves them, and is ahvays too hard for himself”2 If this portrait had been presented to Montaigne, I have little doubt that he would have had the candour to acknowledge, that he recognised in it some of the most prominent and characteristical fea¬ tures of his own mind.3 The most elaborate, and seemingly the most serious, of all Montaigne’s essays, is his long and somewhat tedious Apology for Haimond de Sebonde, contained in the twelfth chapter of his second book. This author appears, from Mon¬ taigne’s account, to have been a Spaniard, who professed physic at Thoulouse, towards the end of the fourteentli century; and who published a treatise, entitled, Theologia Naturalis, which was put into the hands of Montaigne’s father by a friend, as a useful antidote against the inno¬ vations with which Luther was then beginning to disturb the ancient faith. That, in this parti¬ cular instance, the book answered the intended purpose, may be presumed from the request of old Montaigne to his son, a few days before his 1 “ Sentant sa fin approcher, il fit dire la messe dans sa chambre.

"death, to translate it into French from the Spa¬ nish original. His request was accordingly- complied with; and the translation is referred to hy Montaigne in the first edition of his Essays, printed at Bourdeaux in 1580; hut the execu¬ tion of this filial duty seems to have produced on Montaigne’s own mind very different effects from what his father had anticipated.1 The principal aim of Sehonde’s hook, accord¬ ing to Montaigne, is to show that “ Christians are in the wrong to make human reasoning the basis of their belief, since the object of it is only conceived hy faith, and by a special inspiration of the divine grace.” To this doctrine Mon¬ taigne professes to yield an implicit assent; and, under the shelter of it, contrives to give free vent to all the extravagances of scepticism. The essential distinction between the reason of man, and the instincts of the lower animals, is at great length, and with no inconsiderable inge¬ nuity, disputed; the powers of the human un¬ derstanding, in all inquiries, whether physical or moral, are held up to ridicule; an universal Pyrrhonism is recommended; and we are again and again reminded, that “ the senses are the be¬ ginning and the end of all our knowledge” Who¬ ever has the patience to peruse this chapter with attention, will be surprised to find in it the ru¬ diments of a great part of the licentious philo¬ sophy of the eighteenth century; nor can he fail to remark the address with which the author avails himself of the language afterwards adopt¬ ed by Bayle, Helvetius, and Hume :—“ That, to be a philosophical sceptic, is the first step to¬ wards becoming a sound believing Christian.”3 It is a melancholy fact in ecclesiastical history, that this insidious maxim should have been sanctioned, in our times, hy some theologians of no common pretensions to orthodoxy; who, in direct contradiction to the words of Scripture, have ventured to assert, that “ he who comes to God must first believe that he is not.” Is it necessary to remind these grave retailers of Bayle’s sly and ironical sophistry, that every argument for Christianity, drawn from its in¬ ternal evidence, tacitly recognises the authority of human reason; and assumes, as the ultimate criteria of truth and of falsehood, of right and of wrong, certain fundamental articles of belief, discoverable hy the light of Nature ?5 Charron is well known as the chosen friend of Montaigne’s latter years, and as the confi¬ dential depositary of his philosophical senti¬ ments. Endowed with talents far inferior in force and originality to those of his master, he possessed, nevertheless, a much sounder and more regulated judgment; and as his reputation, notwithstanding the liberality of some of his peculiar tenets, was high among the most re¬ spectable and conscientious divines of his own church, it is far from improbable, that Mon¬ taigne committed to him the guardianship of his posthumous fame, from motives similar to those which influenced Pope, in selecting Warburton as his literary executor. The discharge of this trust, however, seems to have done less good to Montaigne than harm to Charron; for while the unlimited scepticism, and the indecent levities The very few particulars known with respect to Sebonde have been collected by Bayle.—See his Dictionary, Art","Mon, Mon, Warburton","IN,PK,FR",8,"India,Pakistan,France","Asia,Asia,Europe"
"In reading La Rochefoucauld, it should ne¬ ver be forgotten, that it was within the vortex of a court he enjoyed his chief opportunities of studying the world; and that the narrow and exclusive circle in which he moved was not likely to afford him the most favourable speci¬ mens of human nature in general. Of the Court of Lewis XIV. in particular, we are told by a very nice and reflecting observer (Madame de la Fayette), that C£ ambition and gallantry were the soul, actuating alike both men and wo¬ men. So many contending interests, so many different cabals were constantly at work, and in all of these, women bore so important a part, that love was always mingled with business, and business with love. Nobody was tranquil or in¬ different. Every one studied to advance him¬ self by pleasing, serving, or ruining others. Idle¬ ness and languor were unknown, and nothing was thought of but intrigues or pleasures.” In the passage already quoted from Voltaire, he takes notice of the effect of La Rochefou¬ cauld’s Maxims, in improving the style of French composition. We may add to this remark, that their effect has not been less sensible in vitiating the tone and character of French philosophy, by bringing into vogue those false and degrading representations of human nature and of human life, which have prevailed in that country, more or less, for a century past. Mr Addison, in one of the papers of the Taller, expresses his in¬ dignation at this general bias among the French writers of his age. “ It is impossible,” he ob¬ serves, “ to read a passage in Plato or Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without being a greater and better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modish French authors, or those of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that nation, without being, for some time, out of humour with myself, and at everything about me. Their business is to depreciate human nature, and to consider it under the worst appearances; they give mean interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions. In short, they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man, or between the species of man and that of the brutes.”1 It is very remarkable, that the censure here bestowed by Addison on the fashionable French wits of his time should be so strictly applicable to Helvetius, and to many others of the most admired authors whom France has produced in our own day. It is still more remarkable to find the same depressing spirit shedding its malig¬ nant influence on French literature, as early as the time of La Rochefoucauld, and even of Mon¬ taigne ; and to observe how very little has been done by the successors of these old writers, but to expand into grave philosophical systems their loose and lively paradoxes; disguising and for¬ tifying them by the aid of those logical princi¬ ples, to which the name and authority of Locke have given so wide a circulation in Europe","Of, Plato, Addison, Mon","FR,TR,CO,US,IN",8,"France,Turkey,Colombia,United States,India","Europe,Asia,South America,North America,Asia"
"57 ber or importance of the facts which he has re¬ marked concerning our intellectual powers, to various other writers of an earlier date. I al¬ lude merely to his clear and precise conception of that operation of the understanding (distin¬ guished afterwards in Locke’s Essay by the name of Reflection), through the medium of which all our knowledge of Mind is exclusively to be ob¬ tained. Of the essential subserviency of this power to every satisfactory conclusion that can be formed with respect to the mental phenome¬ na, and of the futility of every theory which would attempt to explain them by metaphors borrowed from the material world, no other phi¬ losopher prior to Locke seems to have been ful¬ ly aware ; and from the moment that these truths were recognised as logical principles in the study of mind, a new era commences in the history of that branch of science. It will be necessary, therefore, to allot to the illustration of this part of the Cartesian philosophy a larger space than the limits of my undertaking will permit me to afford to the researches of some succeeding inquirers, who may, at first sight, appear more worthy of attention in the present times",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Of this a very remarkable example has since oc¬ curred in the case of Mr Locke, who, although he has been at great pains to show, that the power of refection bears the same relation to the study of the mental phenomena, which the power of observation bears to the study of the material world, appears, nevertheless, to have been far less decided than Descartes with respect to the essential distinction between Mind and Matter ; and has even gone so far as to hazard the un¬ guarded proposition, that there is no absurdity in supposing the Deity to have superadded to the other qualities of matter the power of thinking",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"61 knowing, affirming, denying, consenting, refu¬ sing, susceptible of pleasure and of pain.1 Of all these things I might have had complete ex¬ perience, without any previous acquaintance with the qualities and laws of matter; and therefore it is impossible that the study of mat¬ ter can avail me aught in the study of my¬ self. This, accordingly, Descartes laid down as a first principle, that nothing comprehensible by the imagination can be at all subservient to the knowledge of Mind ; and that the sensible images involved in all our common forms of speaking concerning its operations, are to he guarded against with the most anxious care, as tending to confound, in our apprehensions, two classes of phenomena, which it is of the last importance to distinguish accurately from each other.2 To those who are familiarly acquainted with the writings of Locke, and of the very few among his successors who have thoroughly en¬ tered into the spirit of his philosophy, the fore¬ going observations may not appear to possess much either of originality or of importance; hut when first given to the world, they formed the greatest step ever made in the science of Mind, by a single individual. What a contrast do they ex¬ hibit, not only to the discussions of the school¬ men, but to the analogical theories of Hobbes at the very same periotf! and how often have they been since lost sight of, notwithstanding the clearest speculative conviction of their truth and importance, by Locke himself, and by the greatest part of his professed followers ! Had they been duly studied and understood by Mr Horne Tooke, they would have furnished him with a key for solving those etymological riddles, which, although mistaken by many of his con¬ temporaries for profound philosophical discove¬ ries, derive, in fact, the whole of their mystery, from the strong bias of shallow reasoners to re¬ lapse into the same scholastic errors, from which Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid, have so successfully laboured to emancipate the mind","Of, Berkeley","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"

"I have elsewhere observed, that Descartes has been very generally charged by the writers of the last century, with a sophistical play upon words in his doctrine concerning the non-exist¬ ence of secondary qualities; while, in fact, he was the first person by whom the fallacy of this scholastic paralogism was exposed to the world.1 In proof of this, it might be sufficient to refer to his own statement, in the first part of the Prin- cipia ;2 hut, for a reason which will immediate¬ ly appear, I think it more advisable, on this occa¬ sion, to borrow the words of one of his earliest and ablest commentators. <{ It is only (says Father Malehranche) since the time of Descartes, that to those confused and indeterminate questions, whether fire is hot, grass green, and sugar sweet, philosophers are in use to reply, hy distinguish¬ ing the equivocal meaning of the words express¬ ing sensible qualities. If hy heat, cold, and savour, you understand such and such a dispo¬ sition of parts, or some unknown motion of sensible qualities, then fire is hot, grass green, and sugar sweet. But if by heat and other qualities you understand what I feel hy fire, what I see in grass, &c. fire is not hot, nor grass green ; for the heat I feel, and the colours I see, are only in the soul.”5 It is surprising how this, and other passages to the same purpose in Male¬ hranche, should have escaped the notice of Dr Reid; for nothing more precise on the ambigui¬ ty in the names of secondary qualities is to be found in his own works. It is still more sur¬ prising that Buffier, who might have been ex¬ pected to have studied with care the speculations of his illustrious countryman, should have di¬ rectly charged, not only Descartes, but Male¬ hranche, with maintaining a paradox, whicx they were at so much pains to banish from the schools of philosophy.4 The important observations of Descartes upon this subject, made their way into England very soon after his death. They are illustrated at considerable length, and with great ingenuity, hy Glanville, in his Scepsis Scientifica, published “Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke, revived the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. But thev made the secondary qualities mere sensations, and the primary ones resemblances of our sensations. They maintained that colour, sound, and heat, are not any thing in bodies, but sensations of the mind. The paradoxes of these philo¬ sophers were only an abuse of words. For when they maintain, as an important modern discovery, that there is no heat in the fire, they mean no more than that the fire does not feel heat, which every one knew before.”—Reid’s Inquiry, chan, v. sect. viii","Male, Male",MV,8,Maldives,Asia
"amples of this occurs in the acquired perceptions of sight, where our estimates of distance are frequently the result of an intellectual process, comparing a variety of different signs together, without a possibility on our part, the moment afterwards, of recalling one single step of the process to our recollection. Our inattention to the sensations of colour, consiclered as affections of the Mind, or as modifications of our own being, appears to me to he a fact of precisely the same description; for all these sensations were plainly intended by nature to perform the office of signs, indicating to us the figures and distances of things external. Of their essential importance in this point of view, an idea may be formed, by supposing for a moment the whole face of nature to exhibit only one uniform colour, without the slightest variety even of light and shade. Is it not self-evident that, on this sup¬ position, the organ of sight would be entirely useless, inasmuch as it is by the varieties of colour alone that the outlines or visible figures of bodies are so defined, as to be distinguishable one from another ? Nor could the eye, in this case, give us any information concerning diver¬ sities of distance ; for all the various signs of it, enumerated by optical writers, pre-suppose the antecedent recognition of the bodies around us, as separate objects of perception. It is not there¬ fore surprising, that signs so indispensably sub¬ servient to the exercise of our noblest sense, should cease, in early infancy, to attract notice as the subjects of our consciousness; and that afterwards they should present themselves to the imagination rather as qualities of Matter, than as attributes of Mind.1 To this reference of the sensation of colour to the external object, I can think of nothing so analogous as the feelings we experience in sur¬ veying a library of books. We speak of the volumes piled up on its shelves, as treasures or magazines of the knowledge of past ages; and contemplate them with gratitude and reverence, as inexhaustible sources of instruction and delight to the mind. Even in looking at a page of print or of manuscript, we are apt to say, that the ideas we acquire are received by the sense of sight; and we are scarcely conscious of a metaphor, when we employ this language. On such oc¬ casions we seldom recollect, that nothing is per¬ ceived by the eye but a multitude of black strokes drawn upon white paper, and that it is our own acquired habits which communicate to these strokes the whole of that significancy whereby they are distinguished from the unmeaning scrawling of an infant or a changeling. The knowledge which we conceive to be preserved in books, like the fragrance of a rose, or the gild¬ ing of the clouds, depends, for its existence, on the relation between the object and the percipient mind; and the only difference between the two cases is, that in the one, this relation is the local and temporary effect of conventional habits; in the other, it is the universal and the unchange¬ able work of nature. The art of printing, it is to be hoped, will in future render the former relation, as well as the latter, coeval with our species; but, in the past history of mankind, it is impossible to say how often it may have been dissolved. What vestiges can now be traced of those scientific attainments which, in early times, drew to Egypt, from every part of the civilised world, all those who were anxious to be initia¬ ted in the mysteries of philosophy ? The sym¬ bols which still remain in that celebrated coun¬ try, inscribed on eternal monuments, have long lost the correspondent which reflected upon them their own intellectual attributes. To us ' In Dr Iteid’s Inquiry, he has introduced a discussion concerning the perception of visible figure, which has puzzled me since the first time (more than forty years ago) that I read his work. The discussion relates to this question, “ Whether there be any sensation proper to visible figure, by which it is suggested in vision ?” The result of the argument is, that “ our eye might have been so framed as to suggest the figure of the object, without suggesting colour, or any other quality ; and, of consequence, there seems to be no sensation appropriated to visible figure; this quality being suggested immediately by the material impression upon the organ, of which impression we are not conscious.”—Inquiry, chap. vi. sect. 8. To my apprehension, nothing can appear more manifest than this, that, if there had been no variety in our sensations of colour, and still more, if we had had no sensation of colour whatsoever, the organ of sight could have given us no information, either with respect to figures or to distances ; and, of consequence, would have been as useless to us, as if we had been af¬ flicted, from the moment of our birth, with a gutta serena",Of,"EG,TR",8,"Egypt,Turkey","Africa,Asia"
"It is mortifying to reflect on the inconceivably small number of subsequent inquirers by whom the spirit of this cardinal maxim has been fully seized; and that, even in our own times, the old and inveterate prejudice to which it is op¬ posed, should not only have been revived with success, but should have been very generally re¬ garded as an original and profound discovery in metaphysical science. These circumstances must plead my apology for the space I have as¬ signed to the Cartesian Metaphysics in the crowded historical picture which I am at present attempting to sketch. The fulness of illustra¬ tion which I have bestowed on the works of the master, Avill enable me to pass over those of his disciples, and even of his antagonists, with a correspondent brevity.1 After having said so much of the singular merits of Descartes as the father of genuine me¬ taphysics, it is incumbent on me to add, that his errors in this science were on a scale ol propor¬ tionate magnitude. Of these the most promi¬ nent (for I must content myself with barely mentioning a few of essential importance) were his obstinate rejection of all speculations about final causes;2 his hypothesis concerning the lower animals, which he considered as mere ma¬ chines;3 4 his doctrine of innate ideas, as under¬ stood and expounded by himself;* his noted para¬ dox of placing the essence of mind in thinking, and of matter in extension ;5 and his new modi¬ fication of the ideal theory of perception, adopt¬ ed afterwards, with some very slight changes, by Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.0 To some of these errors I shall have occasion to refer in the sequel of this Discourse.

"In what I have hitherto said of Descartes, I have taken no notice of his metaphysico-physio- logical theories relative to the connection be¬ tween soul and body. Of these theories, how¬ ever, groundless and puerile as they are, it is necessary for me, before I proceed farther, to say a few words, on account of their extensive and lasting influence on the subsequent history of the science of Mind, not only upon the Con¬ tinent, but in our own island",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"“ C’est done avec raison que plusieurs Parle- mens ne punissent point les sorciers: ils s’en trouve beaucoup moins dans les terres de leur ressort: Et 1’envie, et la malice des medians ne peuvent se servir de ce pretexte pour accabler les innocens.” How strikingly has the sagacity of these an¬ ticipations and reflections been verified, by the subsequent history of this popular superstition in our own country, and indeed in every other instance where the experiment recommended by Malebranche has been tried ! Of this sagacity much must, no doubt, be ascribed to the native vigour of a mind struggling against and control¬ ling early prejudices; but it must not be for¬ gotten, that, notwithstanding his retired and monastic life, Malebranche had breathed the same air with the associates and friends of Des¬ cartes and of Gassendi ; and that no philosopher seems ever to have been more deeply impressed with the truth of that golden maxim of Mon¬ taigne—“ II est bon de frotter et limer notre cervelle contre eelle d’autrui.” Another feature in the intellectual character of Malebranche, presenting an unexpected con¬ trast to his powers of abstract meditation, is the attentive and discriminating eye with which he appears to have surveyed the habits and man¬ ners of the comparatively little circlcr around him; and the delicate yet expressive touches with which he has marked and defined some of the nicest shades and varieties of genius.2 To this branch of the Philosophy of Mind, not cer¬ tainly the least important and interesting, he i • !a!1S ^lsPosl.tlon to blend theological dogmas with philosophical discussions, Malebranche was so little conscious m mmselt, that he senously warned his readers against it, by quoting an aphorism of Bacon’s, peculiarly applicable to his own n mgs. x divinorum et humanorum malesana admixtione non solum educitur philosophiaphantastica, sed etiam reli- gxo hseretica. Itaque salutare admodum est si mente sobria fidei tantum dentur quse fidei sunt.” In transcribing these words, it is amusing to observe, that Malebranche has slily suppressed the name of the author from whom they are bor¬ rowed ; manifestly from an unwillingness to weaken their effect, by the suspicious authority of a philosopher not in com- munion with the Church of Home.—Recherche de la Verite, Liv. ii. chap. ix","Of, Mon","TR,IN",8,"Turkey,India","Asia,Asia"

"The Adventures of Telemachus, when consider¬ ed as a production of the seventeenth centmy, and still more as the work of a Roman Catholic Bishop, is a sort of prodigy; and it may, to this day, be confidently recommended, as the best manual extant, for impressing on the minds of youth the leading truths, both of practical mo¬ rals and of political economy.

"£t It might have been expected,” says Mr Smith, {C that the reasonings of lawyers upon the different imperfections and improvements of the laws of different countries, should have given occasion to an inquiry into what were the natural rules of justice, independent of all positive institution. It might have been ex¬ pected, that these reasonings should have led them to aim at establishing a system of what might properly be called Natural Jurisprudence, or a theory of the principles which ought to run through^ and to he the foundation of the laws of all nations. But, though the reasonings of lawyers did produce something of this kind, and though no man has treated systematically of the laws of any particular country, without intermixing in his work many observations of this sort, it was very late in the world before any such general system was thought of, or before the philosophy of laws was treated of by itself, and without regard to the particular institutions of any na¬ tion. Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which ought to run through, and be the foundation of the laws of all nations; and his Treatise of the Laws of Peace and War, with all its imperfections, is per¬ haps, at this day, the most complete work that has yet been given on the subject.” Whether this was, or was not, the leading object of Grotius, it is not material to decide; but if this was his object, it will not be disputed that he has executed his design in a very desul¬ tory manner, and that he often seems to have lost sight of it altogether, in the midst of those miscellaneous speculations on political, ethical, and historical subjects, which form so large a portion of his Treatise, and which so frequently succeed each other without any apparent con¬ nection or common aim.1 Nor do the views of Grotius appear always enlarged or just, even when he is pointing at the object described by Mr Smith. The Roman system of Jurisprudence seems to have warped, in no inconsiderable degree, his notions on all questions connected with the theory of legisla¬ tion, and to have diverted his attention from that philosophical idea of law, so well expressed by Cicero,—“ Non a prsetoris edicto, neque a duodecim tabulis, sed penitus ex intima philo- sophia, hauriendam juris disciplinam.” In this idolatry, indeed, of the Roman law, he has not gone so far as some of his commentators, who have affirmed, that it is only a different name for the Law of Nature; but that his partiality for his professional pursuits has often led him to overlook the immense difference between the state of society in ancient and modern Europe, will not, I believe, be now disputed. It must, at the same time, be mentioned to his praise, that no writer appears to have been, in theory) more completely aware of the essential distinc¬ tion between Natural and Municipal laws. In one of the paragraphs of his Prolegomena) he mentions it as a part of his general plan, to illus¬ trate the Roman code, and to systematise those parts of it which have their origin in the Law of Nature. <£ The task,” says he, ££ of mould¬ ing it into the form of a system, has been pro¬ jected by many, but hitherto accomplished by none. Nor indeed was the thing possible, while so little attention was paid to the distinction between natural and positive institutions; for the former being everywhere the same, may be easily traced to a few general principles, while the latter, exhibiting different appearances at different times, and in different places, elude 1 “ Of what stamp,” says a most ingenious and original thinker, “ are the works of Grotius, Puffendorff, and Ilurla- maqui?

"Of the truth of this last proposition Bacon seems to have been fully aware; and it was manifestly some ideas of the same kind which gave birth to Montesquieu’s historical specula¬ tions with respect to the origin of laws, and the reference which they may he expected to hear, in different parts of the world, to the physical and moral circumstances of the nations among whom they have sprung up.

"Of the circumstances which gave occasion to this great and memorable undertaking, the fol¬ lowing interesting account is given in the Pre¬ fatory Epistle to the Reader. “ Five or six friends, meeting at my chamber, and discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found them¬ selves quickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had a while puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course, and that, before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to ex¬ amine our own abilities, and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all readily assented, and thereupon it was agreed, that this should be our first inquiry",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"No one has opened a better and clearer way to reasoning.”2 In a passage of one of Warburton’s letters to Hurd, which I had occasion to quote in the first part of this Dissertation, it is stated as a fact, that, £C when Locke first published his Essay, he had neither followers nor admirers, and hardly a single approver.” I cannot help suspecting very strongly the correctness of this assertion, not only from the flattering terms in which the Essay is mentioned by Shaftesbury in the foregoing quotation, and from the frequent allusions to its doctrines by Addison and other popular writers of the same period, but from the unexampled sale of the book, during the fourteen years which elapsed between its publication and Locke’s death. Four editions were printed in the space of ten years, and three others must have ap¬ peared in the space of the next four; a refer¬ ence being made to the sixth edition by the au¬ thor himself, in the epistle to the reader, prefix¬ ed to all the subsequent impressions. A copy of the thirteenth edition, printed as early as 1748, is now lying before me. So rapid and so extensive a circulation of a work, on a subject so little within the reach of common readers, is the best proof of the established popularity of the author’s name, and of the respect generally entertained for his talents and his opinions","Warburton, Addison","PK,US",8,"Pakistan,United States","Asia,North America"

Heineccius, a native of Saxony, in a Sketch of the History of Philosophy, printed in 1728, omits altogether the name of Locke in his enumeration of the logical and metaphysical writers of modern Europe. In a passage of his logic, where the same author treats of clear and obscure, adequate and inadequate ideas (a subject on which little or nothing of any value had been advanced before Locke), he observes, in a note, “ Debemus hanc Doctrinam Leibnitio, eamque deinde sequutus est illust. Wolfius.” 4 Of the Essay on Human Understanding Crousaz speaks m the following terms : “ Clarissimi, et merito celebratissimi Lockii de Intellectu Humano eximium opus, et auctore suo dignissimum, logicis utilissimis semper annumerabitur.”— {Prcefat.) If Pope had ever looked into this Treatise, he could not have committed so gross a mistake, as to introduce the author into the Dunciad, among Locke’s Aristotelian opponents; a distinction for which Crousaz was probably indebted to his acute strictures on those passages in the Essay on Man, which seem favourable to fatalism","Of, Man","TR,CI",8,"Turkey,Côte d'Ivoire","Asia,Africa"
"Warburton, with his usual scurrility towards all Pope’s adversaries as well as his own, has called Crousaz a blundering Swiss ; but a very different estimate of his merits has been formed by Gibbon, who seems to have studied his works much more carefully than the Right Reverend Commentator on the Dunciad",Warburton,"PK,SZ",8,"Pakistan,Eswatini","Asia,Africa"
"Of this extraordinary man Gibbon gives the following account in his Journal; “ C’est un ministre dans le Pays de Vaud, et un des plus beaux genies que je connoisse. II a voulu embrasser tous les genres ; mais c’est la. Philosophic qu’il a le plus approfondi. Sur toutes les questions il s’est fait des systemes, ou du moins des argumens toujours originaux et tou- jours ingenieux. Ses idees sont fines et lumineuses, son expression heureuse et facile. On lui reproche avec raison trop de rafinement et de subtilitd dans 1’esprit; trop de fierte, trop d’ambition, et trop de violence dans le caractere. Cet homme, qui auroit pu eclairer ou troubler une nation, vit et mourra dans 1’obscurite'.” It is of the same person that Gibbon sneeringly says, in the words of Vossius, “ Est sacrificulus in pago, et rusticos decipit.” 2 “ Je peux vous assurer qu’avant moi personne en France ne connoissoit la poesie Angloise; h peine avoit on entendu parler de Locke. J’ai e'te' persecute' pendant trente ans par une nude de fanatiques pour avoir dit que Locke est 1’Her- cule de la Metaphysique, qui a pose les bornes de I’Esprit Humain.”—(Ferney, 1768.) In the following passage of the Age of Louis XIV. the same celebrated writer is so lavish and undistinguishing in his praise of Locke, as almost to justify a doubt whether he had ever read the book which he extols so highly. “ Locke seul a developpd Ventendement humain, dans un livre oil il n’y a que des veritds; et ce qui rend 1’ouvrage parfait, toutes ces verites sont claires.” 3 Moliere was in his youth so strongly attached to the Epicurean theories, that he had projected a translation of Lu¬ cretius into French. He is even said to have made some progress in executing his design, when a trifling accident de¬ termined him, in a moment of ill humour, to throw his manuscript into the fire. The plan on which he was to proceed in this bold undertaking does honour to his good sense and good taste, and seems to me the only one on.which a successful version of Lucretius can ever be executed. The didactic passages of the poem were to be translated into prose, and. the descriptive passages into verse. Both paxts would have gained greatly by this compromise; for, where Lucretius wishes to unfold the philosophy of his master, he is not less admirable for the perspicuity and precision of his expressions, than he is on other occasions, where his object is to detain and delight the imaginations of his readers, for the charms of his figurative diction, and for the bold relief of his images. In instances of the former kind, no modern language can give 108 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Of,"FR,TR",8,"France,Turkey","Europe,Asia"

Of the three persons just men¬ tioned, the two last died only a few years before Locke’s Essay was published; and may be pre¬ sumed to have left behind them many younger pupils of the same school.

"“ First, then, it appears to me, that all the most complex ideas arise from sensation, and that reflection is not a distinct source, as Mr Locke makes it.”—(Hartley on Man, 4th Ed. p. 360 of the Introduction.) This last proposition Hartley seems to have considered as an important and original improvement of his own on Locke’s it no mean praise, if I have been sometimes able to dispose into method, to collect into heads and articles, or to exhibit in more compact and tangible masses, what, in that excellent performance, is spread over too much surface.”—(Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, Preface, pp. 25, 26.) Of an author whom Dr Paley has honoured with so very warm an eulogy, it would be equally absurd and presumptuous to dispute the merits. Nor have I any wish to detract from the praise here bestowed on him as an original thinker and ob¬ server. I readily admit, also, his talent for illustration, although it sometimes leads him to soar into bombast, and more frequently to sink into buffoonery. As an honest inquirer after moral and religious truth, he is entitled to the most un¬ qualified approbation. But, I must be permitted to add, that, as a metaphysician, he seems to me much more fanciful than solid ; and, at the same time, to be so rambling, verbose, and excursive, as to be more likely to unsettle than to fix the principles of his readers","Man, Of","CI,TR",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,Turkey","Africa,Asia"
"La Harpe proceeds in the same panegyrical strain through more than seventy pages, and concludes his eulogy of Con¬ dillac with these words : “ Le style de Condillac est clair et pur comme ses conceptions; c’est en general 1’esprit le plus juste et le plus lumineux qui ait contribue, dans ce siecle, aux progres de la bonne philosophic.”.—(Ibid. p. 214.) La Harpe’s account of the power of Refiection wrill form an appropriate supplement to his comments on Condillac. “ L’im- pression sentie des objets se nomme perception; Paction de 1’ame qui les considere, se nomme reflexion. Ce mot, il est vrai, exprime un mouvement physique, celui de se replier sur soi-meme ou sur quelque chose ; mais Unites nos idees venant des sens, nous sommes souvent obliges de nous servir de termes physiques pour exprimer les operations de Pame.”—(Ibid. p. 158.) In another passage, he defines Reflection as follows : “ La facultd de reflexion, e’est-a-dire, le pouvoir qu’a notre ame, de comparer, d’assembler, de combiner les perceptions.”—(Ibid. p. 183.) How widely do these definitions of reflection differ from that given by Locke; and how exactly do they accord with the Philosophy of Gassendi, of Hobbes, and of Diderot! In a lately published sketch Of the State of French Literature during the Eighteenth Century (a work, to which the Author’s taste and powers as a writer have attracted a degree of public attention something beyond what was due to his philosophi¬ cal depth and discernment), there are some shrewd, and, in my opinion, sound remarks, on the moral tendency of that me¬ taphysical system to which Condillac gave so much circulation and celebrity. I shall quote some of his strictures which bear more particularly on the foregoing argument",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"(For the preservation of this precious memorial of Mr Locke, the public is indebted to the descendants of his friend and relation the Lord Chancellor King, to whom his papers and library were bequeathed. The original is still in the posses¬ sion of the present representative of that noble family ; for whose flattering permission to enrich my Dissertation with the above extracts, I feel the more grateful, as I have not the honour of being personally known to his Lordship.) 1 Mr Locke, it would appear, had once intended to publish his thoughts on the Conduct of the Understanding, as an ad¬ ditional chapter to his Essay. “ I have lately,” says he, in a Letter to Mr Molyneux, “ got a little leisure to think of some additions to my book against the next edition, and within these few days have fallen upon a subject that I know not how far it will lead me. I have written several pages on it, but the matter, the farther I go, opens the more upon me, and I cannot get sight of any end of it. The title of the chapter will be, Of the Conduct of the Understanding, which, if I shall pursue as far as I imagine it will reach, and as it deserves, will, 1 conclude, make the largest chapter of my Essay.” (Locke’s JFbrfo, Yol. IX. p. 407.) 2 A similar remark may be extended to a letter from Locke to his friend Mr Samuel Bold, who had complained to him of the disadvantages he laboured under from a weakness of memory. It contains nothing but what might have come from the pen of one of Newberry’s authors ; but with what additional interest do we read it, when considered as a comment by Locke on a suggestion of Bacon’s !—(Locke’s Works, Yol. X. p. 317-) It is a judicious reflection of Shenstone’s, that “ every single observation published by a man of genius, be it ever so tri¬ vial, should be esteemed of importance, because he speaks from his own impressions ; whereas common men publish common things, which they have perhaps gleaned from frivolous writers. I know of few authors to whom this observation applies more forcibly and happily than to Locke, when he touches on the culture of the intellectual powers. His precepts, indeed, are not all equally sound ; but they, in general, contain a large proportion of truth, and may always furnish to a specula¬ tive mind matter of useful meditation",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"1. According to the system of Pre-established Harmony, the human mind and human body are two independent but constantly correspond¬ ent machines ;—adjusted to each other like two unconnected clocks, so constructed, that, at the same instant, the one should point the hour, and the other strike it. Of this system the follow¬ ing summary and illustration are given by Leib¬ nitz himself, in his Essay entitled Theodiccea : “ I cannot help coming into this notion, that God created the soul in such manner at first, that it should represent within itself all the simultaneous changes in the body; and that he has made the body also in such manner, as that it must of itself do what the soul wills :—So that the laws which make the thoughts of the soul follow each other in regular succession, must produce images which shall he coincident with the impressions made by external objects upon our organs of sense; while the laws by which the motions of the body follow each other, are likewise so coincident with the thoughts of the soul, as to give to our volitions and actions the very same appearance, as if the latter were really the natural and the necessary consequences of the former.”—(Leib. Op. I. p. 163.) Upon another occasion he observes, that {£ every thing goes on in the soul as if it had no body, and that every thing goes on in the body as if it had no soul.” {Ibid. II. p. 44.) To convey his meaning still more fully, Leib¬ nitz borrows from Mr Jaquelot1 a comparison, which, whatever may he thought of its justness, must he at least allowed some merit in point of ingenuity. “ Suppose that an intelligent and powerful being, who knew, beforehand, every particular thing that I should order my footman to do to-morrow, should make a machine to re¬ semble my footman exactly, and punctually to perform, all day, whatever I directed. On this supposition, would not my will in issuing all the details of my orders, remain, in every respect, in the same circumstances as before? And would not my machine-footman, in performing his dif¬ ferent movements, have the appearance of acting only in obedience to my commands ?” The in¬ ference to he drawn from this comparison is, that the movements of my body have no direct dependence whatever on the volitions of my mind, any more than the actions of my machine- footman would have on the words issuing from my lips. The same inference is to he extended to the relation which the impressions made on my different senses hear to the co-existent percep¬ tions arising in my mind. The impressions and perceptions have no mutual connection, resembling that of physical causes with their effects; hut the one series of events is made to correspond invariably with the other, in consequence of an eternal harmony between them pre-established by their common Creator",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

"“ Two things” (says Warburton, who professes to speak Pope’s sentiments) “ the most self-evident, the existence of our souls and the freedom of our will!” 2 So completely, indeed, and so mathematically linked, did Leibnitz conceive all truths, both physical and moral, to be with each other, that he represents the eternal geometrician as incessantly occupied in the solution of this problem,— The State of one Monad (or elementary atom) being given, to determine the state, past, present, and future, of the whole universe",Warburton,PK,8,Pakistan,Asia
"I. Of the principle of the Sufficient Reason, the following succinct account is given by Leib¬ nitz himself, in his controversial correspondence with Dr Clarke: “ The great foundation of Mathematics is the principle of contradiction or identity; that is, that a proposition cannot be true and false at the same time. But, in order to proceed from Mathematics to Natural Philo¬ sophy, another principle is requisite (as I have observed in my Theodiccea); I mean, the prin¬ ciple of the Sufficient Reason ; or, in other words, that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so, rather than otherwise : And, ac¬ cordingly, Archimedes was obliged, in his book De JEquilibrio, to take for granted, that if there be a balance, in which every thing is alike on both sides, and if equal weights are hung on the two ends of that balance, the whole will be at rest. It is because no reason can be given why one side should weigh down rather than the other. Now, by this single principle of the Sufficient Reason, may be demonstrated the being of a God, and all the other parts of Metaphysics or Natural Theology; and even, in some measure, those physical truths that are independent of Mathematics, such as the Dynamical Principles, or the Principles of Forces.” to a Scotch gentleman, Mr Burnet of Kemney ; to whom he seems to have unbosomed himself on all subjects without any reserve: “ Mon livre intitule' Essais de Theodicee, sur la bonte de Dieu, la liberte de I’homme, et 1’origine de mal, sera bientot acheve. La plus grande partie de cet ouvrage avoit ete' faite par lambeaux, quand je me trouvois chez la feue Heine de Prusse, oil ces matieres dtoient souvent agite'es a 1’occasion du Dictionnaire et des autres ouvrages de M. Bayle, qu’on y lisoit beaucoup. Apres la mort de cette grande Princesse, j’ai rassemble' et augments ces pie'ces sur Pexhortation des amis qui en e'toient informes, et j’en ai fait Pouvrage dont je viens de parler. Comme j’ai medite' sur cette matiere depuis ma jeunesse, je pretends de Pavoir discutee a fond.”—(Leibnitz, Opera, Tom. VI. p. 284.) In another letter to the same correspondent, he expresses himself thus: / “ La plupart de mes sentimens ont e'te' enfin arrete's apres une deliberation de 20 ans: car j’ai commence bien jeune a mediter, et je n’avois pas encore 15 ans, nuand je me promenois des journees entieres dans un bois, pour prendre parti entre Aristote et Lemocrite. Cependant j’ai change et rechange sur des nouvelles lumieres, et ce n’est que depuis environ 12 ans que je me trouve satisfait, et que je suis arrive a des demonstrations sur ces matieres qui n en paroissent point capables : Cependant de la maniere que je m’y prends, ces demonstrations peuvent etre sensibles comme cedes des nombres, quoique le sujet passe 1’imagination.”—(Ibid. p. 253.) The letter from which this last paragraph is taken is dated in the year 1697> My chief reason for introducing these extracts, was to do away an absurd suspicion, which has been countenanced by some respectable writers (among others bv Le Clerc), that the opinions maintained in the Theodicee of Leibnitz were not his real sentiments, and that his own creed, on the most important questions there discussed, was not very different from that of Bayle. Gibbon has even gone so far as to say, that “ in his defence of the attributes and providence of the Deity, he was suspected of a secret correspondence with his adversary.”—(Antiquities of the House of Brunswick.) In support of this very improbable charge, I do not know that any evidence has ever been produced, except the following passage, in a letter of his, addressed to a Professor of Theology in the University of Tubingen (Pfaffius):—“ Ita prorsus est, vir summe re- verende, uti scribis, de Theodicaea mea. Item acu tetigisti; et miror, neminem hactenus fuisse, qui sensum hunc meum senserit. Neque enim Philosophorum est rem serio semper agere ; qui in fingendis hypothesibus, uti bene mones, ingenii sui vires experiuntur. Tu, qui Theologus, in refutandis erroribus Theologum agis.” In reply to this it is observed, by the learned editor of Leibnitz’s works, that it is much more probable that Leibnitz should have expressed himself on this particular occasion in jocular and ironical terms, than that he should have wasted so much ingenuity and learning in sup¬ port of an hypothesis to which he attached no faith whatever; an hypothesis, he might have added, with which the whole principles of his philosophy are systematically, and, as he conceived, mathematically connected. It is difficult to believe, that among the innumerable correspondents of Leibnitz, he should have selected a Professor of Theology at Tubingen, as the sole depository of a secret which he was anxious to conceal from all the rest of the world","Of, Mon, Brunswick, University","US,TR,IN",8,"United States,Turkey,India","North America,Asia,Asia"
"With respect to the principle from which these important consequences were deduced, it is ob¬ servable, that it is stated by Leibnitz in terms so general and vague, as to extend to all the different departments of our knowledge; for he tells us, that there must be a sufficient reason for every existence, for every event, and for every truth. This use of the word reason is so extreme¬ ly equivocal, that it is quite impossible to annex any precise idea to the proposition. Of this it is unnecessary to produce any other proof than the application which is here made of it to things so very different as existences, events, and truths; in all of which cases, it must of necessity have different meanings. It would be a vain attempt, therefore, to combat the maxim in the form in which it is commonly appealed to: Nor, indeed, can we either adopt or reject it, without con¬ sidering particularly how far it holds in the va¬ rious instances to which it may be applied",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Whether this vagueness of language was the effect of artifice, or of a real vagueness in the author’s notions, may perhaps he doubted; but that it has contributed greatly to extend his re¬ putation among a very numerous class of readers, may be confidently asserted. The possession of a general maxim, sanctioned by the authori¬ ty of an illustrious name, and in which, as in those of the schoolmen, more seems to he meant than meets the ear, affords of itself no slight gratification to the vanity of many; nor is it inconvenient for a disputant, that the maxims to which he is to appeal should he stated in so du¬ bious a shape, as to enable him, when pressed in an argument, to shift his ground at pleasure, from one interpretation to another. The extra¬ ordinary popularity which, in our own times, the philosophy of Kant enjoyed, for a few years, among the countrymen of Leibnitz, may, in like manner, be in a great degree ascribed to the imposing aspect of his enigmatical oracles, and to the consequent facility of arguing without end, in defence of a system so transmutable and so elusive in its forms",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"2 While Bonnet was thus employing his ingenuity in generalising, still farther than his predecessors had done, the law of continuity, one of the most distinguished of his fellow citizens, with whom he appears to have been connected in the closest and most confidential friendship (the very ingenious M. Le Sage), was led, in the course ol his researches concerning^ the physical cause of gravitation, to deny the existence of the law, even in the descent of heavy bodies. “ The action ot gravity (according to him) is not continuous.” In other words, “ each of its impressions is finite; and the interval or time which separates it from the following impression is of a finite duration.” Of this proposition he offers a proof, which he considers as demonstrative; and thence deduces the following very paradoxical corollary, That “ Projectiles do not move in curvilinear paths, but in rectilinear polygons.” *—“ C’est ainsi (he adds) qu’un prds, qui yu de pres, se trouve couvert de parties vertes reellement separees, offre cependant aux personnes qui le regardent de loin, la sensation dune verdure continue : Et qu’un corps poli, auquel le microscope decouvre mille solutions de continuite, paroit a I’oeil nu, posseder une continuity parfaite.” . ' , “ Ge'ndralement, le simple bons sens, qui veut, qu’on suspende son jugement sur ce qu’on ignore, et que 1 on ne tranche pas hardiment sur la non-existence de ce qui echappe a nos sens, auroit du empecher des gens qui s’appelloient phxlosophes de decider si dogmatiquement, la continuite reelle, de ce qui avoit une continuity apparente ; et la non-existenar des. m- tervalles qu’ils n’apercevoient pas.”—fEssai de Chymie Mecanique. Couronne en 1758, par 1’Academic de Rouen : Impnme a Geneve, 1761. pp. 94. 95. 96.) . , , i c r r i 3 It may, perhaps, be alleged, that the above allusion to the Law of Continuity was introduced merely for the sake or il¬ lustration, and that the author did not mean his words to be strictly interpreted; but this remark will not be made by those who are acquainted with the philosophy of Helvetius. . , ' Let me add, that, in selecting Corneille as the only exemplification of this theory, Helvetius has been singularly unlor- tunate. It would have been difficult to have named any other modern poet, in whose works, when compared with those ol his immediate predecessors, the Law of Continuity has been more remarkably violated. “Corneille (says a most judicious French critic) est, pour ainsi dire, de notre terns; mais ses contemporains n’en sont pas. Le Cid, les Horaces, Cinna, o- lieucte, forment le commencement de cette chaine brillante qui reunit notre litterature actuelle de celle du regne e ic e- lieu et de la minority de Louis XIV.; mais autour de ces points lumineux regne encore une nuit profonde ; leur eclat les rapproche en apparence de nos yeux; le reste, repousse dans Pobscurity, semble bien loin de nous. Pour nous ornei w est moderne, et Rotrou ancien,” &c. (For detailed illustrations and proofs of these positions, see a slight but masterly His¬ torical sketch of the French Theatre, by M.

"when kept within certain limits, is not only so¬ lid but important; a mode of reasoning', which, although it may be always safely followed out in pure Mathematics (where the principles on which we proceed are mere definitions), is a never-failing source of error in all the other sciences; and which, when practically applied to the concerns of life, may be regarded as an infallible symptom of an understanding better fitted for the subtle contentions of the schools, than for those average estimates of what is ex¬ pedient and practicable in the conduct of affairs, which form the chief elements of political saga¬ city and of moral wisdom.1 If on these two celebrated principles of Leib¬ nitz, I have enlarged at greater length than may appear to some of my readers to be necessary, I must remind them, ls£, Of the illustration they afford of what Locke has so forcibly urged with respect to the danger of adopting, upon the faith of reasonings a priori, metaphysical conclu¬ sions concerning the laws by which the universe is governed: 2dly, Of the proof they exhibit of the strong bias of the human mind, even in the present advanced stage of experimental know¬ ledge, to grasp at general maxims, without a careful examination of the grounds on which they rest; and of that less frequent, but not less unfortunate bias, which has led some of our most eminent mathematicians to transfer to sciences, resting ultimately on an appeal to facts, those habits of thinking which have been formed amidst the hypothetical abstractions of pure geometry : Lastly, Of the light they throw on the mighty influence which the name and autho¬ rity of Leibnitz have, for more than a century past, exercised over the strongest and acutest understandings in the most enlightened coun¬ tries of Europe","Of, Of, Of",TR,8,Turkey,Asia

Bailly, a writer by no means partial to D’Alembert, quotes, with entire approbation, the foregoing observa¬ tions; subjoining to them, in the following terms, his own judgment on the merits of this branch of the controversy be¬ tween Clarke and Leibnitz. “ La notion du temps et de 1’espace, est un des points sur lesquels Leibnitz a combattu cen¬ tre Clarke ; mais il nous semble que 1’Anglois n’a rien oppose de satisfaisant aux raisons de Leibnitz.”—(Eloge de Leibnitz. ) As for the point here in dispute, I must own, that it does not seem to me a fit subject for argument; inasmuch as I can¬ not even form a conception of the proposition contended for by Leibnitz. The light in which the question struck Clarke in his childhood, is the same in which I am still disposed to view it; or rather, I should say, is the light in which I must ever view it, while the frame of my understanding continues unaltered. Of what data is human reason possessed, from which it is entitled to argue in opposition to truths, the contrary of which it is impossible not only to prove, but to express in terms comprehensible by our faculties ?

"* Mr Gibbon, in commenting upon the celebrated lines of Virgil, “ Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus, “ Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet,” observes, that “ the mind which is infused into the different parts of matter, and which mingles itself with the mighty mass, scarcely retains any property of a spiritual substance, and bears too near an affinity to the principles which the im¬ pious Spinoza revived rather than invented.” He adds, however, that “ the poverty of human language, and the obscu¬ rity of human ideas, make it difficult to speak worthily of the great first cause ; and that our most religious, poets (particularly Pope and Thomson), in striving to express the presence and energy of the Deity in every part of the universe, deviate unwarily into images which require a favourable construction. But these writers (he candidly remarks) deserve that favour, by the sublime manner in which they celebrate the Great Father of the universe, and by those effusions of love and gratitude which are inconsistent with the materialist’s system.”—{Misc. Works, Vol. II. pp. 509,. 510.) May I be permitted here to remark, that it is not only difficult but impossible to speak of the omnipresence and omnipo¬ tence of God, without deviating into such images ? With the doctrine of the Anima Mundi, some philosophers, both ancient and modern, have connected another theory, according to which the souls of men are portions of the Supreme Being, wdth whom they are re-united at death, and in whom they are finally absorbed and lost. To assist the imagination in conceiving this theory, death has been, compared to the breaking of a phial of water, immersed in the ocean. It is needless to say, that this incomprehensible jargon has no necessary connection with the doctrine which represents God as the soul of the world, and that it would have been loudly disclaimed, not only by Pope and Thomson, but by Epictetus, Antoninus, and all the wisest and soberest of the Stoical school. Whatever objections, therefore, may be made to this doctrine, let not its supposed consequences be cnxigea upon any but those who may expressly avow them. On such a subject, as Gibbon has well remarked, “ we should be slow to suspect, and still slower to condemn.”—(/6id. p. 510.) Sir William Jones mentions a very curious modification of this theory of absorption, as one ot the doctrines of the Vedanta school. “ The Vedanta school represent Elysian happiness as a total absorption, though not such as to destroy consciousness, in the Divine Essence.”—(Dissertation on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India.) 148 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",,"GR,IT,IN",8,"Greece,Italy,India","Europe,Europe,Asia"

"It does not seem to me a very improbable conjecture, that Bayle had intended, and per¬ haps attempted, to write an account of Mon¬ taigne ; and that he had experienced greater difficulties than he was aware of, in the execu¬ tion of his design. Notwithstanding their com¬ mon tendency to scepticism, no two characters were ever more strongly discriminated in their most prominent features; the doubts of the one resulting from the singular coldness of his mo¬ ral temperament, combined with a subtlety and over-refinement in his habits of thinking, which rendered his ingenuity, acuteness, and erudition, more than a match for his good sense and sa¬ gacity;—the indecision of the other partaking 1 See, in particular, his account of the effects produced on the character of Pericles by the sublime lessons of Anaxagoras",Mon,IN,8,India,Asia
"153 more of the shrewd and soldier-like etourderie of Henry IV. when he exclaimed, after hearing two lawyers plead on opposite sides of the same question, “ Ventre St Gris ! il me sembk que tons les deux ont raison.” Independently of Bayle’s constitutional bias towards scepticism, some other motives, it is probable, conspired to induce him, in the com¬ position of his Dictionary, to copy the spirit and tone of the old Academic school. On these col¬ lateral motives a strong and not very favourable light is thrown by his own candid avowal in one of his letters. “ In truth (says he to his correspondent Minutoli), it ought not to be thought strange, that so many persons should have inclined to Pyrrhonism; for of all things in the world it is the most convenient. You may dispute with impunity against every body you meet, without any dread of that vexatious argument which is addressed ad hominem. You are never afraid of a retort; for as you announce no opinion of your own, you are always ready to abandon those of others to the attacks of so¬ phists of every description. In a word, you may dispute and jest on all subjects without in¬ curring any danger from the lex talionis.”1 It is amusing to think, that the Pyrrhonism which Bayle himself has here so ingeniously accounted for, from motives of conveniency and of literary cowardice, should have been mistaken by so many of his disciples for the sportive triumph of a superior intellect over the weaknesses and errors of human reason.1 2 3 * The profession of Bayle, which made it an object to him to turn to account even the sweep¬ ings of his study, affords an additional explana¬ tion of the indigested mass of heterogeneous and inconsistent materials contained in his Dictio¬ nary. Had he adopted any one system exclusive¬ ly, his work would have shrunk in its dimen¬ sions into a comparatively narrow compass.5 When these different considerations are ma¬ turely weighed, the omission by Bayle of the article Montaigne will not be much regretted by the admirers of the Essays. It is extremely doubtful if Bayle would have been able to seize the true spirit of Montaigne’s character; and, at any rate, it is not in the delineation of charac¬ ter that Bayle excels. His critical acumen, indeed, in the examination of opinions and 1 “ En verite, il ne faut pas trouver etrange que tant des gens aient donnd dans le Pyrrhonisme. Car c’est la chose du monde le plus commode. Vous pouvez impunement disputer centre tous venans, et sans craindre ces argumens ad hominem, qui font quelquefois tant de peine. Vous ne craignez point la retorsion; puisque ne soutenant rien, vous abandonnez de bon coeur a tous les sophismes et a tous les raisonnemens de la terre quelque opinion quece soit. Vous n’etes jamais obligd den venu a la defensive. En un mot, vous contestez et vous daubez sur toutes choses tout votre saoul, sans craindre la peine du talion.”—(Oeuv. Div. de Bayle, IV. p. 537.) “ The estimate formed by Warburton of Bayle’s character, both intellectual and moral, is candid and temperate. “ A writer whose strength and clearness of reasoningcan only be equalled by the gaiety, easiness, and delicacy, of his wit; who, pervading human nature with a glance, struck into the province of paradox, as an exercise for the restless vigour of his mind: who, with a soul superior to the sharpest attacks ol fortune, and a heart practised to the best philosophy, had not yet enough of real greatness, to overcome that last foible of superior geniuses, the temptation of honour, which the acade¬ mical exercise of wit is supposed to bring to its professors.—Legation.) If there be anything objectionable in this panegyric, it is the unqualified praise bestowed on Bayle’s wit, which, though it seldom fails in copiousness, in poignancy, or in that grave argumentative irony, by which it is still more characte¬ ristically marked, is commonly as deficient in gaiety and delicacy as that of Warburton himself","Warburton, Warburton",PK,8,Pakistan,Asia
"4 In justice to Bayle, and also to Gibbon, it should be remembered, that over the most offensive passages in their works they have drawn the veil of the learned languages. It was reserved for the translators of the Historical and Critical Dic¬ tionary to tear this veil asunder, and to expose the indelicacy of their author to every curious eye. It is impossible to ob¬ serve the patient industry and fidelity with which they have executed this part of their task without feelings of indignation and disgust. For such an outrage on taste and decorum, their tedious and feeble attacks on the Manicheism of Bayle offer but a poor compensation. Of all Bayle’s suspected heresies, it was perhaps that which stood the least in need of a serious refutation; and, if the case had been otherwise, their incompetency to contend with such an adversary would have only injured the cause which they professed to defend",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"depth,1 are to be numbered among the charac- teristical attributes of his genius. Far less does he ever anticipate, by the moral lights of the soul, the slow and hesitating decisions of the un¬ derstanding; or touch with a privileged hand those mysterious chords to which all the social sympathies of our frame are responsive. Had his ambition, however, been more exalted, or his philanthropy more warm and diffusive, he would probably have attempted less than he actually accomplished ; nor would he have stooped to en¬ joy that undisputed pre-eminence which the public voice has now unanimously assigned him, among those inestimable though often ill requit¬ ed authors, whom Johnson has called “ the pioneers of literature.” The suspense of judgment which Bayle’s Dictionary inspires with respect to facts, is, per¬ haps, still more useful than that which it en¬ courages in matters of abstract reasoning. Fon- tenelle certainly went much too far, when he said of history, that it was only a collection of Fables Convenues ;—a most significant and happy phrase, to which I am sorry that I cannot do justice in an English version. But though Fon- tenelle pushed his maxim to an extreme, there is yet a great deal of important truth in the re¬ mark ; and of this I believe every person’s con¬ viction will he stronger, in proportion as his knowledge of men and of books is profound and extensive.2 Of the various lessons of historical scepticism to be learned from Bayle, there is none more practically valuable (more especially in such revolutionary times as we have witnessed) than that which relates to the biographical portraits of distinguished persons, when drawn by their theological and political opponents. In illustra¬ tion of this, I have only to refer to the copious and instructive extracts which he has produced from Roman Catholic writers, concerning the lives, and still more concerning the deaths, of Luther, Knox,5 Buchanan, and various other leaders or partizans of the Reformation. It would be impossible for any well-informed Pro¬ testant to read these extracts, without indulging a smile at their incredible absurdity, if every feeling of levity were not lost in a sentiment of deep indignation at the effrontery and falsehood of their authors. In stating this observation, I have taken my examples from Roman Catholic libellers, without any illiberal prejudices against the members of that church. The injustice done by Protestants to some of the conscientious de¬ fenders of the old faith has been, in all probabi¬ lity, equally great; but this we have no oppor¬ tunity of ascertaining here, by the same direct evidence to which we can fortunately appeal, in vindication of the three characters mentioned above. With the history of two of them every person in this country is fully acquainted; and I have purposely selected them in preference to others, as their names alone are sufficient to cover with disgrace the memory of their calumniators.4 A few years before the death of Bayle, Fon- tenelle began to attract the notice of Europe.5 I class them together on account of the mighty influence of both on the literary taste of their contemporaries; an influence in neither case founded on any claims to original genius, or to important improvements; but on the attractions which they possessed in common, though in very different ways, as popular writers; and on the easy and agreeable access which their works opened to the opinions and speculations of the * I speak of that metaphysical depth which is the exclusive result of what Newton called patient thinking.

"4 Of all Bayle’s works, “ the most useful and the least sceptical,” according to Gibbon, “ is his Commentaire Philoso- phique on these words of the Gospel, Compel them to come in.” The great object of this commentary is to establish the general principles of Toleration, and to remonstrate with the members of Protestant churches on the inconsistency of their refusing to those they esteem heretics, the same indulgence which they claim for themselves in Catholic countries. The work is diffuse and rambling, like all Bayle’s compositions • but the matter is excellent, and well deserves the praise which Gibbon has bestowed on it",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Fontenelle was a nephew of the great Cor¬ neille ; but his genius was, in many respects, very strongly contrasted with that of the author of the Cid. Of this he has himself enabled us to judge by the feeble and unsuccessful attempts in dramatic poetry, by which he was first known to the world. In these, indeed, as in all his productions, there is an abundance of ingenu¬ ity, of elegance, and of courtly refinement; but not the faintest vestige of the mens divinior, or of that sympathy with the higher and nobler passions which enabled Corneille to re-animate and to reproduce on the stage the heroes of an¬ cient Rome. The circumstance, however, which more peculiarly marks and distinguishes his writings, is the French mould in which education and habit seem to have recast all the original features of his mind;—identifying, at the same time, so perfectly the impressions of art with the workmanship of nature, that one would think the Parisian, as well as the man, had started fresh and finished from her creative hand. Even in his Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, the dry discussions with the Marchioness about the now forgotten vortices of Descartes, are en¬ livened throughout by a never-failing spirit of light and national gallantry, which will for ever render them an amusing picture of the manners of the times, and of the character of the author. The gallantry, it must be owned, is often strained and affected; but the affectation sits so well on Fontenelle, that he would appear less easy and graceful without it","Of, Rome","TR,US,FR",8,"Turkey,United States,France","Asia,North America,Europe"

The effect of these in reclaiming the public taste from the licentiousness and grossness introduced into England at the period of the Restoration ; in recommending the most serious and important truths by the united at¬ tractions of wit, humour, imagination, and elo¬ quence ; and, above all, in counteracting those superstitious terrors which the weak and igno¬ rant are so apt to mistake for religious and moral impressions—has been remarked by numberless critics, and is acknowledged even by those who felt no undue partiality in favour of the authors.8 Some of the papers of Addison, however, are of an order still higher, and bear marks of a mind which, if early and steadily turned to philoso¬ phical pursuits, might have accomplished much more than it ventured to undertake. His fre¬ quent references to the Essay on Human Under¬ standing, and the high encomiums with which they are always accompanied, show how suc¬ cessfully he had entered into the spirit of that work, and how completely he was aware of the importance of its object. The popular nature of his publications, indeed, which rendered it necessary for him to avoid everything that might savour of scholastic or of metaphysical discussion, has left us no means of estimating his philosophical depth, but what are afforded by the results of his thoughts on the particular topics which he has occasion to allude to, and by some of his incidental comments on the scientific merits of preceding authors. But these means are sufficiently ample to justify a very high opinion of his sound and unprejudiced judgment, as well as of the extent and correct¬ ness of his literary information. Of his powers as a logical reasoner he has not enabled us to form an estimate; but none of his contempo¬ raries seem to have been more completely tinc¬ tured with all that is most valuable in the me¬ taphysical and ethical systems of his time.3 But what chiefly entitles the name of Addi¬ son to a place in this Discourse, is his Essays on the Pleasures of Imagination ; the first attempt in England to investigate the principles of the fine arts ; and an attempt which, notwithstand¬ ing many defects in the execution, is entitled to the praise of having struck out a new avenue to the study of the human mind, more alluring than any which had been opened before. In this respect, it forms a most important supple¬ ment to Locke's Survey of the Intellectual Powers ; and it has, accordingly, served as a text, on which the greater part of Locke’s disciples have been eager to offer their comments and their corrections.

"He then proceeds to show, that they are unsa¬ tisfactory ; and that it is necessary, for the so¬ lution of this problem, to avail ourselves of prin¬ ciples borrowed from a higher philosophy : Af¬ ter which, he explains, in detail, his own theory concerning the ideas (sensations) which, by ex¬ perience, become signs of distance;1 2 * or (to use his own phraseology) “ by which distance is suggested* to the mind.” The result of the whole is, that, “ a man boi-n blind, being made to see, would not at first have any idea of dis¬ tance by sight. The sun and stars, the remotest objects as well as the nearest, would all seem to be in his Eye, or rather in his Mind.”* From this quotation it appears, that, before Berkeley’s time, philosophers had advanced greatly beyond the point at which Aristotle stopped, and towards which Condillac, in his first publication, made a retrograde movement. Of this progress some of the chief steps may be traced as early as the twelfth century in the Optics of Alhazen ;4 and they may be perceived still more clearly and distinctly in various op¬ tical writers since the revival of letters; parti¬ cularly in the Optica Promota of James Gre¬ gory. 5 Father Malebranche went still farther, and even anticipated some of the metaphysical i \ Tn°r assi?ting persons unaccustomed to metaphysical studies to enter into the spirit and scope of Berkeley’s Theory, the best illustration I know of is furnished by the phenomena of the Phantasmagoria. It is sufficient to hint at this application ot these phenomena, to those who know anything of the subject. r 2 The word suggest is much used by Berkeley, in this appropriate and technical sense, not only in his Theory of Visioti, but m his Principles of Human Knowledge, and in his Minute Philosopher. It expresses, indeed, the cardinal principle on which his Theory o/1 Vision hinges; and is now so incorporated with some of our best metaphysical speculations, that one cannot easily conceive how the use of it was so long dispensed with. Locke (in the passage quoted in the Note, p. 107.) uses the word excite for the same purpose; but it seems to imply an hypothesis concerning the mechanism of the mind, and by no means expresses the fact in question with the same force and precision","Berkeley, Of, Berkeley, Berkeley","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"

" How, for example, could they ima¬ gine or comprehend such words as matter, mind, substance, mode, figure, motion, since our phi¬ losophers, who have so long made use of them, scarcely understand them, and since the ideas attached to them, being purely metaphysical, can have no model in nature ?” “ I stop at these first steps” (continues Rous¬ seau), “ and intreat my judges to pause, and consider the distance between the easiest part of language, the invention of physical substantives, and the power of expressing all the thoughts of man, so as to speak in public, and influence so¬ ciety. I entreat them to reflect upon the time and knowledge it must have required to dis¬ cover numbers, abstract words, aorists, and all the tenses of verbs, particles, syntax, the art of connecting propositions and arguments, and how to form the whole logic of discourse. As for myself, alarmed at these multiplying diffi¬ culties, and convinced of the almost demon¬ strable impossibility of language having been formed and established by means merely human, I leave to others the discussion of the problem, i Whether a society already formed was more necessary for the institution of language, or a language already invented for the establishment of society ?’ ”* Of the various difficulties here enumerated, that mentioned by Rousseau, in the last sentence, was plainly considered by him as the greatest of all; or rather as comprehending under it all 1 That men never could have invented an artificial language, if they had not possessed a natural language, is an observa¬ tion of Dr Iteid’s; and it is this indisputable and self-evident truth which gives to Rousseau’s remark that imposing plau¬ sibility, which, at first sight, dazzles and perplexes the judgment.

"175 the rest. But this difficulty arises merely from his own peculiar and paradoxical theory about the artificial origin of society; a theory which needs no refutation, but the short and luminous aphorism of Montesquieu, that “ man is born in society, and there he remains.” The other dif¬ ficulties touched upon by Rousseau, in the for¬ mer part of this quotation, are much more se¬ rious, and have never yet been removed in a manner completely satisfactory: And hence some very ingenious writers have been led to conclude, that language could not possibly have been the work of human invention. This ar¬ gument has been lately urged with much acute¬ ness and plausibility by Dr Magee of Dublin, and by M. de Bonald of Paris.1 It may, how¬ ever, be reasonably questioned, if these philoso¬ phers would not have reasoned more logically, had they contented themselves with merely af¬ firming, that the problem has not yet been solv¬ ed, without going so far as to pronounce it to n be absolutely insolvable. For my own part, when I consider its extreme difficulty, and the short space of time during which it has engaged the attention of the learned, I am more dispos¬ ed to wonder at the steps which have been al¬ ready gained in the research, than at the num¬ ber of desiderata which remain to employ the ingenuity of our successors. It is justly re¬ marked by Dr Ferguson, that, “ when language has attained to that perfection to which it ar¬ rives in the progress of society, the speculative mind, in comparing the first and the last stages of the progress, feels the same sort of amaze¬ ment with a traveller, who, after rising insen¬ sibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look down from a precipice, to the summit of which he scarcely believes he could have ascended with¬ out supernatural aid.”2 With respect to some of the difficulties point¬ ed out by Rousseau and his commentators, it may be here remarked in passing (and the ob¬ servation is equally applicable to various pas¬ sages in Mr Smith’s dissertation on the same subject), that the difficulty of explaining the theory of any of our intellectual operations af¬ fords no proof of any difficulty in applying that operation to its proper practical purpose; nor is the difficulty of explaining the metaphysical nature of any part of speech a proof, that, in its first origin, it implied any extraordinary effort of intellectual capacity. How many metaphy¬ sical difficulties might be raised about the ma¬ thematical notion of a line ? And yet this notion is perfectly comprehended by every peasant, when he speaks of the distance between two places; or of the length, breadth, or height of his cottage. In like manner, although it may be difficult to give a satisfactory account of the origin and import of such words as of or by, we ought not to conclude, that the invention of them implied any metaphysical knowledge in 1 The same theory has been extended to the art of writing; but if this art was first taught to man by an express reve¬ lation from Heaven, what account can be given of its present state in the great empire of China ?

To this observation may be added, by way of com¬ ment, the following reflections of one of the most learned prelates of the English church :—“ Man, we are told, had a lan¬ guage from the beginning; for he conversed with God, and gave to every animal its particular name. But how came man by language ? He must either have had it from inspiration, ready formed from his Creator, or have derived it by the exer¬ tion of those faculties of the mind, which were implanted in him as a rational creature, from natural and external objects with which he was surrounded. Scripture is silent on the means by which it was acquired. We are not, therefore, war¬ ranted to affirm, that it was received by inspiration, and there is no internal evidence in language to lead us to such a sup¬ position. On this side, then, of the question, we have nothing but uncertainty; but on a subject, the causes of which are so remote, nothing is more convenient than to refer them to inspiration, and to recur to that easy and comprehensive argu¬ ment, Ails irsXusro (houXn' that is, man enjoyed the great privilege of speech, which distinguished him at first, and still continues to distinguish him as a rational creature, so eminently from the brute creation, without exerting those reasoning faculties, by which he was in other respects enabled to raise himself so much above their level. Inspiration, then, seems to have been an argument adopted and made necessary by the difficulty of accounting for it otherwise; and the name of inspiration carries with it an awfulness, which forbids the unhallowed approach of inquisitive discussion.”—(Essay on the Study of Antiquities, by Dr Bur¬ gess, 2d edit. Oxford, 1732. Pp. 85, 86.) It is farther remarked very sagaciously, and I think very decisively, by the same author, that “ the supposition of man having received a language ready formed from his Creator, is actually inconsistent with the evidence of the origin of our ideas, which exists in language For, as the origin of our ideas is to be traced in the words through which the ideas are conveyed, so the origin oflanguage is referable to the source from whence our (first) ideas are derived, namely, nature1 and external objects.”—(Ibid. pp. 83, 84.) 176 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Dublin, Paris, Man, Oxford","US,CN,CI,UK",8,"United States,China,Côte d'Ivoire,N/A","North America,Asia,Africa,N/A"

Nor will this appear surprising, when we consider how impossible it is for us to judge, from our own experience, of the intellectual processes which pass in the minds of savages. Some instincts, we know, possessed both by them and by infants (that ot imitation, for example, and the use of natural signs), disappear in by far the greater number of in¬ dividuals, almost entirely in the maturity of their reason. It does not seem at all improbable, that other instincts connect¬ ed with the invention ot speech, may be confined to that state of the intellectual powers which requires their guidance: nor is it quite impossible, that some latent capacities of the understanding may be evolved by the pressure of necessity","Providence, VAn, Paris","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"Apres quelques mouvemens inutiles pour la chasser, le philosophe lui donna un grand coup de pied, qui fit jetter a la chienne un cri de dou- leur, et a M. de Fontehelle un cri de compas¬ sion. Eh quoi (lui dit froidement le P. Male¬ branche) ne s^avez vous pas bien que cela ne se sent point ?” On this point Fontenelle, though a zealous Cartesian, had the good sense to dissent openly from his master, and eA en to express his appro¬ bation of the sarcastic remark of La Motte, que cette opinion sur lesanimaux etoit une debauche de raisonnement. Is not the same expression equally applicable to the opposite theory quoted from Helvetius ? 2 From those representations of human nature which tend to assimilate to each other the facul¬ ties of man and of the brutes, the transition to atheism is not very wide. In the present in¬ stance, both conclusions seem to be the neces¬ sary corollaries of the same fundamental maxim",Male,MV,8,Maldives,Asia
"For if all the sources of our knowledge are to he found in the external senses, how is it possible for the human mind to rise to a conception of the Supreme Being, or to that of any other truth either of natural or of revealed religion ? To this question Gassendi and Condillac, it cannot be doubted, were both able to return an answer, which seemed to themselves abundantly satisfactory. But how few of the multitude are competent to enter into these refined explana¬ tions ? And how much is it to be dreaded, that the majority will embrace, with the general prin¬ ciple, all the more obvious consequences which to their own gross conceptions it seems neces¬ sarily to involve ? Something of the same sort may be remarked in the controversy about the freedom of the human will. Among the multi¬ tudes whom Leibnitz and Edwards have made converts to the scheme of necessity, how com¬ paratively inconsiderable is the number who have acquiesced in their subtle and ingenious attempts to reconcile this scheme with man’s ac¬ countableness and moral agency ? Of the prevalence of atheism at Paris, among the higher classes, at the period of which we are now speaking, the Memoires and Correspondance of the Baron de Grimm afford the most unques¬ tionable proofs.3 His friend Diderot seems to have been one of its most zealous abettors; who, 1 The Abb^ Trublet in the Mercure de Juillet, 1757 (See CEuvres de Fontenelle, Tome II. p. 137.

"Of the levity and extravagance with which such charges have sometimes been brought forward, we have a remarkable instance in a tract entitled Athei Detecti, by a very learned Jesuit Father Hardouin ; (see his Opera Varia Posthuma, Amsterdam, 1733, in fob) where, among a number of other names, are to be found those of Jansenius, Descartes, Malebranche, Arnauld, Nicole, and Pascal. Large additions on grounds equally frivolous, have been made in later times, to this list, by authors, who having themselves made profession of Atheism, were anxious, out of vanity, to swell the number of their sect. Of this kind was a book published at Paris, under some of the revolutionary governments, by Pierre Sylvain Marechal, en¬ titled Dictionnaire des Athecs. Here we meet with the names of St Chrysostom, St Augustin, Pascal, Bossuet, Fenelon, Bellarmin, Labruyere, Leibnitz, and many others not less unexpected. This book he is said to have published at the suggestion of the celebrated astronomer Lalande, who afterwards published a supplement to the Dictionary, supplying the omissions of the author.

"Of the application of theoretical history, to account for the diversities of laws and modes of government among men, I shall have occasion afterwards to speak.

"The same contrast, it would appear, still con¬ tinues to exist between the favourite doctrines of the German and of the French schools. “ In the French empiricism (says a most impartial, as well as competent judge, M.

Ancillon, Preface, (k Paris, 1809.) The intimacy of M. Ancillon’s literary connections both with France and with Germany entitle his opinions on the respective merits of their philosophi¬ cal systems to peculiar weight. If he anywhere discovers a partiality for either, the modest account which he gives of himself would lead us to expect his leaning to be in favour of his countrymen. “ Placd entre la France et PAllemagne, appartenant a la premiere par la langue dans laquelle je hasarde d’dcrire, a la seconde par ma naissance, mes etudes, mes principes, mes affections, et j’ose le dire, par la couleur de ma pensde, je desirerois pouvoir servir de mediateur litte'raire, ou d’interprete philosophique entre les deux nations.” In translating from M. Ancillon the passage quoted in the text, I have adhered as closely as possible to the words of the original; although I cannot help imagining that I could have rendered it still more intelligible to the English reader by laying aside some of the peculiarities of his German phraseology.

"* My ignorance of German would have prevented me from saying anything of the philosophy of Kant, if the extraor¬ dinary pretensions with which it was at first brought forward in this island, contrasted with the total oblivion into which it soon after very suddenly fell, had not seemed to demand some attention to so wonderful a phenomenon in the literary history of the eighteenth century. My readers will perceive that I have taken some pains to atone for my inability to read Kant’s works in the original, not only by availing myself of the Latin version of Born, but by consulting various com¬ ments on them which have appeared in the English, French, and Latin languages. As commentators, however, and even translators, are not always to be trusted to as unexceptionable interpreters of their authors’ opinions, my chief reliance has been placed on one of Kant’s own compositions in Latin ; his Dissertation De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Prineipiis, which he printed as the subject of a public disputation, when he was candidate for a Professorship in the Uni- 188 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Kant, Kant, Born, Kant","KG,NL,DE,UK,FR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands,Germany,N/A,France","Asia,Europe,Europe,N/A,Europe"
"In his own country the reputation of Wolfius is not yet at an end. In the preface to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, he is called “ Summus omnium dogmaticorum Philosophus.”—(Kantii Opera ad Philosophiarn Criticam, Yol. I. Praef. Auctoris Posterior, p. xxxvi. Latine Yertit. I'red. Born. Lipsiae, 1796.) And by one of Kant’s best commentators his name is advantageously contrasted with that of David Hume: “ Est autem scientifica methodus aut dogmatica, aut sceptica","Kant, Born, Kant","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"189 From the time of Wolfius till the philosophy of Kant began to attract general notice, I know of no German metaphysician whose speculations seem to have acquired much celebrity in the learned world.1 Lambert® is perhaps the most illustrious name which occurs during this inter¬ val. As a mathematician and natural philoso¬ pher, his great merits are universally known and acknowledged, but the language in which his metaphysical and logical works were written, has confined their reputation within a compa¬ ratively narrow circle. I am sorry that I can¬ not speak of these from my own knowledge; but I have heard them mentioned in terms of the highest praise, by some very competent judges, to whose testimony I am disposed to give the greater credit, from the singular vein of originality which runs through all his mathe¬ matical and physical publications.3 The Critique of Pure Reason (the most cele¬ brated of Kant’s metaphysical works) appeared in 1781.4 The idea annexed to the title by the author, is thus explained by himself: “ Criti- cam rationis purse non dico censuram librorum et Systematum, sed facultatis rationalis in uni- versum, respectu cognitionum omnium, ad quas, ab omni experientia libera, possit anniti, proinde dijudicationem possibilitatis aut impossibilitatis metaphysices in genere, constitutionemque turn fontium, turn ambitus atque compagis, turn vero terminorum illius, sed cuncta haec ex princi- piis.” ( Kantii, Opera ad Pkilosophiam Criticam., Vol. I. Prsefatio Auctoris Prior, pp. 11, 12.) To render this somewhat more intelligible, I shall subjoin the comment of one of his intimate friends,5 whose work, we are informed by Dr Willich, had received the sanction of Kant him¬ self. “ The aim of Kant’s Critique is no less than to lead Reason to the true knowledge of it¬ self ; to examine the titles upon which it founds the supposed possession of its metaphysical knowledge ; and by means of this examination, to mark the true limits, beyond which it cannot venture to speculate, without wandering into the empty region of pure fancy.” The same author adds, “ The whole Critique of Pure Reason is es¬ tablished upon this principle, that there is a free reason, independent of all experience and sensation.” montrer qu’ils ne sont pas plus propres a satisfaire la raison que le gout.

She adds, however, that they had no school, since none of them attempted to found any system; but they began the war against the doctrines of the Materialists—(Allemagne, Tome III. p. 98.) I am not acquainted with the metaphysical works of any of the three. Those of Hemsterhuis, who wrote wholly in French, were, I understand, first published in a collected form at Paris, in 1792. He was son of the celebrated Greek scholar and critic, Tiberius Hemsterhusius, Profes¬ sor of Latin Literature at Leyden","Kant, Kant, Willich, Kant, Kant, Paris, Kant, Paris","KG,DE,US,FR,GR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany,United States,France,Greece","Asia,Europe,North America,Europe,Europe"
"11 est a regretter que sa logique, intitule Organon, ne soil traduite ni en Latin, ni en Francais, ni je pense en aucune langue. Un extrait bien fait de cet ouvrage, duquel on e'carteroit ce qui repugne au gout national, exciteroit 1’attention des philosophes, et la porteroit sur une multitude d’obje'ts qu’ils se sont accoutumes a regardgr avec indifference.”—(Pre¬ vost, Tome II. pp. 267, 268.) In the article Lambert, inserted in the twenty-third volume of the Biographic Universelle (Paris 1819), the following ac¬ count is given of Lambert’s logic :—“ Wolf, d’apres quelques indications de Leibnitz, avoit retire de 1’oubli la syllogistique d’Aristote, science que les scholastiques avoient tellement avilie que ni Bacon ni Locke n’avoient ose lui accorder un regard d’inte'ret. II e'toit reserve d Lambert de la montrer sous le plus beau jour et dans la plus riche parure. C’est ce qu’il a fait dans son Novum Organon, ouvrage qui est un des principaux titres de gloire de son auteur.” From the writer of this article (M. Servois) we farther learn, that the Novum Organon of Lambert was translated into Latin from the German ori¬ ginal by a person of the name of Pfleiderer, and that this translation was in the hands of an English nobleman (the late Earl of Stanhope) as lately as 1782. I quote the words of M. Servois, in the hope that they may attract some attention to the manuscript, if it be still in existence. The publication of it would certainly be a most acceptable present to the learned world. “ D’apres le conseil de Le Sage de Geneve, 1’ouvrage fut traduit en Latin par Pfleiderer, aux frais d’un savant Italien; cette traduction passa, on ne sait comment, entre les mains de Milord Mahon, qui la possedoit encore en 1782; on ignore quel est son sort ulterieur.” 4 Kant was born at Koenigsberg, in Prussia, in 1724.

"Reprinted at Neufchatel in 1790.) We are farther told by Buhle, that the attention of the public to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason was first attracted by an excellent analysis of the work, which appeared in the General Gazette of Literature, and by the Letters on Kant's Philosophy, which Reinhold inserted in the German Mercury.—(Buhi.e, Tom. VI. p. 573.) Of this last philosopher, who appears, in the first instance, to have entered with enthusiasm into Kant’s views, and who afterwards contributed much to open the eyes of his countrymen to the radical defects of his system, I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. Degerando, as well as Buhle, bestows high praise not only on his clearness, but on his eloquence, as a writer in his own language. “ II a tra- duit les oracles Kantiens dans une langue elegante, harmonieuse, et pure * * * II a su exprimer avec un langage eloquent, des hides jusqu’alors inintelligibles,” &c—(Histoire Comparte, &c.

If any further apology be necessary for quoting a French lady as an authority on German metaphysics, an obvious one is suggested by the extraordinary and well merited popularity of her Allemagne in this country.

The praise bestowed on this part of Kant’s philosophy, by one of his own pupils, is not less warm than that of Madame de Stael.

"Locke only alludes to the accidental limitations of both faculties; but to inquire into the essen¬ tial difference between them does not at all oc¬ cur to him This distinction, then, be¬ tween the sensitive and the intellectual facul¬ ties, forms an essential feature in the philosophy of Kant, and is, indeed, the basis upon which most of his subsequent inquiries are establish¬ ed.”—(Elements of the Crit.

"1 The first edition of this translation was printed as early as 1732. From Buhle’s History of Modern Philosophy (a work which did not fall into my hands till long after this section was written), I find that Cudworth’s Treatise of Immutable Mo¬ rality is now not only well known to the scholars of Germany, but that some of them have remarked the identity of the doctrines contained in it with those of Kant. “ Meiners, dans son histoire generale de PEthique, nie que le systeme morale de Cudworth soit identique avec celui de Platon, et pretend au contraire, ‘ que les principes considerds comme ap- partenans de la mani'ere la plus speciale a la morale de Kant, etaient enseignes il y a deja plusieurs generations par I’ecole du philosophe Anglais.”—{Hist, de la Phil. Moderne, Tom. III. p. 577-) In opposition to this, Buhle states his own decid¬ ed conviction, “ qu’ aucune des idees de Cudworth ne se rapproche de celles de Kant.”—{Ibid.) How far this conviction is well founded, the passage from Cudworth, quoted in the text, will enable my readers to judge for themselves","Kant, Kant, Kant","KG,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany","Asia,Europe"
"That Cudworth has blended with his principles a vein of Platonic mysticism, which is not to be found in Kant, is un¬ deniable ; but it does not follow from this, that none of Kant’s leading ideas are borrowed from the writings of Cudworth","Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Cudworth is at much pains to illustrate the Pla¬ tonic doctrine concerning the difference between sensation and intellection ; asserting that 44 some ideas of the mind proceed not from outward sensible objects, but arise from the inward ac¬ tivity of the mind itselfthat 44 even simple corporeal things, passively perceived by sense, are known and understood only by the active power of the mind and that, besides A/cr^^ara and lavras [Mara, there must he Novara or intel¬ ligible ideas, the source of which can be traced to the understanding alone.1 In the course of his speculations on these sub¬ jects, Cudworth has blended, with some very deep and valuable discussions, several opinions to which I cannot assent, and not a few propo¬ sitions which I am unable to comprehend; hut he seems to have advanced at least as far as Kant, in drawing the line between the provin¬ ces of the senses and of the understanding; and although not one of the most luminous of our English writers, he must he allowed to he far superior to the German metaphysician, both in point of perspicuity and of precision. A later writer, too, of our own country (Dr Price), a zealous follower both of Plato and of Cudworth, afterwards resumed the same argument, in a work which appeared long before the Critique of Pure Reason;2 and urged it with much force against those modern metaphysicians, who con¬ sider the senses as the sources of all our know¬ ledge. At a period somewhat earlier, many very interesting quotations of a similar import had been produced by the learned Mr Harris, from the later commentators of the Alexandrian school on the philosophy of Aristotle; and had been advantageously contrasted by him with the account given of the origin of our ideas, not only by Hobbes and Gassendi, hut by many of the professed followers of Locke. If this part of the Kantian system, therefore, was new in Germany, it certainly could have no claim to the praise of originality, in the estimation of those at all acquainted with English literature.3 In order, however, to strike at the root of what the Germans call the philosophy of sensa- morale de Price pre'sente en effet une analogic frappante avec ceile de Kantand in another part of his work, he expresses himself thus on the same subject: “ Le plus remarquable de tous les moralistes modernes de PAngleterre est, sans con- tredit, Richard Price On remarque 1’analogie la plus frappante entre ses idees sur les bases de lamoralite, et celles que la philosophie critique a fait naitre en Allemagne, quoique il ne soit cependant pas possible d’elever le plus petit doute sur I’entiere originalite de ces dernieres.”—(Tom. V. p. 303.) Is there any thing of importance in the system of Price, which is not borrowed from the Treatise of Immutable Morality ?■ The distinguishing merit of this learned and most respectable writer is the good sense with which he has applied the doctrines of Cudworth to the sceptical theories of his own times","Novara, Kant, Plato","DE,UK,IT,KG,CO",8,"Germany,N/A,Italy,Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Europe,N/A,Europe,Asia,South America"
"1 In this instance, a striking resemblance is observable between the language of Cudworth and that of Kant; both of them having followed the distinctions of the Socratic school, as explained in the Thecetetus of Plato. They who are at all acquainted with Kant’s Critique, will immediately recognise his phraseology in the passage quoted above","Kant, Plato, Kant","KG,CO",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Asia,South America"
"According to Kant himself, his metaphysical doctrines first occurred to him while employed in the examination of Mr Hume’s Theory of Causation. The train of thought by which he was led to them will he best stated in his own words ; for it is in this way alone that I can hope to escape the charge of misrepresentation from his followers. Some of his details would perhaps have been more intelligible to my read¬ ers, had my plan allowed me to prefix to them a slight outline of Hume’s philosophy. But this the general arrangement of my discourse ren¬ dered impossible; nor can any material incon¬ venience result, in this instance, from the order which I have adopted, inasmuch as Hume’s Theory of Causation, how new soever it may have appeared to Kant, is fundamentally the same with that of Malebranche, and of a variety of other old writers, both French and English","Kant, Kant","KG,FR,UK",8,"Kyrgyzstan,France,N/A","Asia,Europe,N/A"
"1 “ Since the Essays (says Kant) of Locke and of Leibnitz, or rather since the origin of metaphysics, as far as their history extends, no circumstance has occurred, which might have been more decisive of the fate of this science than the attack made upon it by David Hume.1 2 3 He proceeded upon a single but important idea in metaphysics, the connection of cause and effect, and the concomitant notions of power and action. He challenged reason to answer him what title she had to imagine, that any thing may be so constituted as that, if it be given, something else is also thereby inferred; for the idea of cause denotes this. He proved beyond contradiction, that it is impossible for reason to think of such a connection a priori, for it con¬ tains necessity ; but it is not possible to perceive how, because something is, something else must necessarily be; nor how the idea of such a con¬ nection can be introduced a priori",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"“ Hence, he concluded, that reason entirely deceives herself with this idea, and that she er¬ roneously considers it as her own child, when it is only the spurious offspring of imagination, impregnated by experience; a subjective neces¬ sity, arising from habit and the association of ideas, being thus substituted for an objective one derived from perception....However hasty and unwarrantable Hume’s conclusion might appear, yet it was founded upon investigation; and this investigation well deserved, that some of the philosophers of his time should have united to solve, more happily if possible, the problem in the sense in which he delivered it: A complete reform of the science might have resulted from this solution. But it is a mortifying reflection, that his opponents, Reid, Beattie, Oswald, and, lastly, Priestley himself, totally misunderstood the tendency of his problem.3 The question was not, whether the idea of cause be in itself proper and indispensable to the illustration of all natu- 1 See the Preface of Kant to one of his Treatises, entitled Prolegomena ad Metaphysicam quamque futuram quce qua Scientia poterit prodire. I have availed myself in the text of the English version of Dr Willich, from the German original, which I have carefully compared with the Latin version of Born. A few sentences, omitted by Willich, I have thought it worth while to quote, at the foot of the page, from the Latin translation—(Elem. of Critical Philosophy, by A. F. M. Wiljlich, M. D","Kant, Born, Willich","DE,KG,NL,UK",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands,N/A","Europe,Asia,Europe,N/A"
"ral knowledge, for this Hume had never doubt¬ ed ; but whether this idea be an object of thought through reasoning a priori; and whether, in this manner, it possesses internal evidence, in¬ dependently of all experience; consequently, whether its utility be not limited to objects of sense alone. It was upon this point that Hume expected an explanation.1 “ I freely own it was these suggestions of Hume’s which first, many years ago, roused me from my dogmatical slumber, and gave to my inquiries quite a different direction in the field of speculative philosophy. I was far from being carried away by his conclusions, the fallacy of which chiefly arose from his not forming to him¬ self an idea of the whole of his problem, but mere¬ ly investigating a part of it, the solution of which was impossible without a comprehensive view of the whole. When we proceed on a well founded, though not thoroughly digested thought, we may expect, by patient and continued re¬ flection, to prosecute it farther than the acute genius had done to whom we are indebted for the first spark of this light. I first inquired, therefore, whether Hume’s objection might not be a general one, and soon found, that the idea of cause and effect is far from being the only one by which the understanding a priori thinks of the connection of things; but rather that the science of metaphysics is altogether founded upon these connections. I endeavoured to as¬ certain their number; and, having succeeded in this attempt, I proceeded to the examination of those general ideas, which, I was now convin¬ ced, are not, as Hume apprehended, derived from experience, but arise out of the pure under¬ standing. This deduction, which seemed im¬ possible to my acute predecessor, and which nobody besides him had ever conceived, al¬ though every one makes use of these ideas, without asking himself upon what their objec¬ tive validity is founded; this deduction, I say, was the most difficult which could have been undertaken for the behoof of metaphysics ; and what was still more embarrassing, metaphysics could not here offer me the smallest assistance, because that deduction ought first to establish the possibility of a system of metaphysics. As I had now succeeded in the explanation of Hume’s problem, not merely in a particular in¬ stance, but with a view of the whole power of pure reason, I could advance with sure though tedious steps, to determine completely, and upon general principles, the compass of Pure Reason, both what is the sphere of its exertion, and what are its limits ; which was all that was required for erecting a system of metaphysics upon a proper and solid foundation.” It is difficult to discover any thing in the fore¬ going passage on which Kant could found a claim to the slightest originality. A variety of English writers had, long before this work ap¬ peared, replied to Mr Hume, by observing that the understanding is itself a source of new ideas, and that it is from this source that our notions of cause and effect are derived. “ Our cer¬ tainty (says Dr Price) that every new event re¬ quires some cause, depends no more on experi¬ ence than our certainty of any other the most obvious subject of intuition. In the idea of every change, is included that of its being an effect.”* In the works of Dr Reid, many remarks of the same nature are to be found; but, instead of quoting any of these, I shall produce a passage from a much older author, whose mode of think¬ ing and writing may perhaps be more agreeble to the taste of Kant’s countrymen than the sim¬ plicity and precision aimed at by the disciples of Locke","Kant, Kant","KG,UK",8,"Kyrgyzstan,N/A","Asia,N/A"
"“ That there are some ideas of the mind (says Dr Cudworth), which were not stamped or im¬ printed upon it from the sensible objects with¬ out, and therefore must needs arise from the in¬ nate vigour and activity of the mind itself, is evident, in that there are, First, Ideas of such things as are neither affections of bodies, nor could be imprinted or conveyed by any local motions, nor can be pictured at all by the fancy ! Although nothing can be more unjust than these remarks, in the unqualified form in which they are stated by Kant, it, must, I think, be acknowledged, that some grounds for them have been furnished by occasional passages which dropped from the pens of most of Mr Hume’s Scottish opponents",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"I would only wish to be informed what additions have been made by Kant to the reply given to Mr Hume by our English philosophers, and to direct the attention of my readers to the close resemblance between this part of Kant’s system, and the argument which Cud worth opposed to Hobbes and Gassendi considerably more than a century ago.* The following passage, from the writer last quoted, approaches so nearly to what Kant and other Germans have so often repeated of the dis¬ tinction between subjective and objective truth, that I am tempted to connect it with the fore¬ going extract, as an additional proof that there are, at least, some metaphysical points, on which we need not search for instruction beyond our own island","Kant, Kant, Kant","KG,UK",8,"Kyrgyzstan,N/A","Asia,N/A"
"“ But we have since also demonstrated, that there is another perceptive power in the soul superior to outward sense, and of a distinct na¬ ture from it, which is the power of knowing or understanding, that is, an active exertion from the mind itself. And, therefore, has this grand eminence above sense, that it is no idiopathy, not a mere private, relative, seeming, and fantasti¬ cal thing, but the comprehension of that which absolutely is and is not.”5 After enlarging on the distinction between the sensitive faculty and the understanding, Kant proceeds to investigate certain essential conditions, without which neither the sensitive faculty nor its objects are conceivable. These conditiens are time and space, which, in the lan¬ guage of Kant, are the forms of all phenomena","Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"What his peculiar ideas are concerning their nature and attributes, my readers will find stat¬ ed in his own words at the end of this Discourse, in an extract from one of his Latin publica¬ tions.4 From that extract, I cannot promise them much instruction; but it will at least en¬ able them to judge for themselves of the pecu¬ liar character of Kant’s metaphysical phraseo¬ logy. In the mean time, it will be sufficient to mention here, for the sake of connection, that he denies the objective reality both of time and of space. The former he considers merely as a subjective condition, inseparably connected with the frame of the human mind, in consequence of which, it arranges sensible phenomena ac¬ cording to a certain law, in the order of succes¬ sion. As to the latter, he asserts, that it is nothing objective or real, inasmuch as it is neither 1 This is precisely the language of the German school: “ Les veritds necessaires, “ says Leibnitz, “ sont le produit im- mediat de Tactivite interieure.”—(Tome I. p. 686. Tome II. pp. 42, 325. See Degerando, Hist. Comp. Tome II. p. 96.) 2 In the attempt, indeed, which Kant has made to enumerate all the general ideas which are not derived from expe¬ rience, but arise out of the pure understanding, he may well lay claim to the praise of originality. On this object I shall only refer my readers to Note X X at the end of this Dissertation","Kant, Kant","KG,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany","Asia,Europe"
"a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation; that its existence, therefore, is only subjective and ideal, depending on a fixed law, inseparable from the frame of the human mind. In conse¬ quence of this law, we are led to conceive all external things as placed in space; or, as Kant expresses it, we are led to consider space as the fundamental form of every external sensation",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"In selecting Kant’s speculations concerning time and space, as a specimen of his mode of writing, I was partly influenced by the consi¬ deration, that it furnishes, at the same time, a remarkable example of the concatenation which exists between the most remote and seemingly the most unconnected parts of his system. Who could suppose that his opinions on these sub¬ jects, the most abstract and the most contro¬ verted of any in the whole compass of metaphy¬ sics, bore on the great practical question of the freedom of the Human Will ? The combina¬ tion appears, at first sight, so very extraordi¬ nary, that I have no doubt I shall gratify the curiosity of some of my readers by mentioning a few of the intermediate steps which, in this argu¬ ment, lead from the premises to the conclusion",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"That Kant conceived the free agency of man to he necessarily implied in his moral nature (or, at least, that he was anxious to offer no violence to the common language of the world on this point), appears from his own explicit de¬ clarations in various parts of his works. “ Vo¬ luntas libera (says he in one instance) eadem est cum voluntate legibus moralibus obnoxia.”1 In all the accounts of Kant’s philosophy, which have yet appeared from the pens of his admirers in this country, particular stress is laid on the ingenuity with which he has unloos¬ ed this knot, which had baffled the wisdom of all his predecessors. The following are the words of one of his own pupils, to whom we are indebted for the first, and, I think, not the least intelligible, view of his principles, which has been published in our language.2 3 “ Professor Kant is decidedly of opinion, that although many strong and ingenious arguments have been brought forward in favour of the freedom of the will, they are yet very far from being decisive. Nor have they refuted the ar¬ guments urged by the Necessitarians, hut by an appeal to mere feeling, which, on such a ques¬ tion, is of no avail. For this purpose, it is in¬ dispensably necessary to call to our assistance the principles of Kant.” “ In treating this subject (continues the same author), Kant begins with showing that the notion of a Free Will is not contradictory. In proof of this he observes, that, although every human action, as an event in time, must have a cause, and so on ad infinitum; yet it is certain, that the laws of cause and effect can have a place there only where time is, for the effect must he consequent on the cause. But neither time nor space are properties of things; they are only the general forms under which man is allowed to view himself and the world. It fol¬ lows, therefore, that man is not in time nor in space, although the forms of his intuitive ideas are time and space. But if man exist not in time and space, he is not influenced by the laws of time and space, among which those of cause and effect hold a distinguished rank ; it is, there¬ fore, no contradiction to conceive, that, in such an order of things, man may he free.”5 In this manner Kant establishes the possibili¬ ty of man’s freedom ; and, farther than this, he does not conceive himself warranted to proceed on the principles of the critical philosophy. The first impression, certainly, which his argument 1 See Born’s Latin Translation of Kant’s Works, relating to the Critical Philosophy, Vol. II. p. 325, et seq. See also the Preface to Vol. III","Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"This small performance is spoken of in terms highly favourable, by the other writers who have attempted to introduce Kant’s philosophy into England. It is called by Dr Willich an excellent publication (Elements of the Critical Philosophy, p. 62.); and is pronounced by the author of the elaborate articles on that subject in the Encyclopaedia Londonemis to be a ster¬ ling work. “ Though at present very little known, I may venture,” says this writer, “ to predict, that, as time rolls on, and prejudices moulder away, this work, like the Elements of Euclid, will stand forth as a lasting monument of pure truth.” —See Note Z Z","Kant, Euclid","KG,US",8,"Kyrgyzstan,United States","Asia,North America"
"Here, however, Kant calls to his aid the prin¬ ciples of what he calls 'practical reason. Deeply impressed with a conviction that morality is the chief concern of man, and that morality and the freedom of the human will must stand or fall to¬ gether, he exerts his ingenuity to show, that the metaphysical proof already brought of the pos¬ sibility of free agency, joined to our own con¬ sciousness of a liberty of choice, affords evidence of the fact fully sufficient for the practical regu¬ lation of our conduct, although not amounting to what is represented as demonstration in the Critique of Pure Reason.1 It is impossible to combine together these two parts of the Kantian system, without being struck with the resemblance they hear to the deceitful sense of liberty to which Lord Kames had recourse (in the first edition of his Essays on Morality and Natural Religion), in order to reconcile our consciousness of free agency with the conclusions of the Necessitarians. In both cases, the reader is left in a state of most un¬ comfortable scepticism, not confined to this par¬ ticular question, but extending to every other subject which can give employment to the hu¬ man faculties.2 In some respects, the functions ascribed by Kant to his practical reason are analogous to those ascribed to common sense in the writings of Beattie and Oswald. But his view of the subject is, on the whole, infinitely more excep¬ tionable than theirs, inasmuch as it sanctions the supposition, that the conclusions of pure reason are, in certain instances, at variance with that modification of reason which was meant by our Maker to be our guide in life ; whereas the constant language of the other writers is, that all the different parts of our intellectual frame are in the most perfect harmony with each other","Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"1 The account of this part of Kant’s doctrine given by M. Buhle agrees in substance with that of Mr Nitsch : “ Toute moralite des actions repose uniquement sur la disposition practique, en tant qu’elle est determinee par la loi morale seule",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Si 1’on considere cette disposition comme phenomena dans la conscience; e’est un evenement naturel, elle obeit a la loi de la causalite', elle repose sur ce que I’homme a eprouve auparavant dans le terns, et elle fait partie du caractere empirique de I’homme. Mais on peut aussi la considerer comme un acte de la liberte raisonnable: Alors elle n’est plus soumise a la loi de la causalite ; elle est inde'pendante de la condition du temps, elle se rapporte a une cause intelligible, la liberte', et elle fait partie du caractere intelligible de I’homme. On ne peut, a la verite, point acquerir la moindre connoissance des objets intelligibles; mais la liberte n’est pas moins un fait de la conscience. Done les actions exterieures sont indifferentes pour la moralite de I’homme. La bonte morale de I’liomme consiste uniquement dans sa volonte moralement bonne, et celle-ci consiste en ce que la volonte soit determine'e par la loi morale seule.”—(Hist, de la Philosophic Moderne, par J. G. Buble, Tom. YI. pp. 504, 505.) Very nearly to the same purpose is the following statement by the ingenious author of the article Leibnitz in the Bio- graphic Universelle:—“ Comment accorder le fatum et la liberte, I’imputation morale et la dependence des etres finies Kant croit echapper a cet e'cueil en ne soumettant a la loi de causalite (au determinisme de Leibnitz) que le monde pheno- menique, et en affranchissant de ce princijfe 1’ame comme noumcne ou chose en soi, envisageant ainsi chaqiie action comme appartenant a un double serie a la fois; a 1’ordre physique ou elle est enchainde a ce qui precede et a ce qui suit par les liens communs de la nature, et d Pordre morale, ou une determination produit un effet, sans que pour expliquer cette voli¬ tion et son resultat, on soit renvoye a un dtat antecedent.” The author of the above passage is M. Staffer, to whom we are indebted for the article Kant in the same work. For Kant’s own view of the subject consult his Critique of Pure Reason, passim, particularly p. 99. et seq. of Born’s Translation, Vol. III","Kant, Kant, Kant, Born","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"2 The idea of Kant (according to his own explicit avowal) was, that every being, which conceives itself to be free, whe¬ ther it be in reality so or not, is rendered by its own belief a moral and accountable agent. “ Jam equidem dico: quteque natura, quae non potest nisi sub idea libertatis agere, propter id ipsum, respectu practice, reipsa libera est; hoc est, ad earn valent cunctae leges, cum libertate arctissime conjunctae perinde, ac voluntas ejus etiam per se ipsam, et in philosophia theoretica probata, libera declaretur—(Kantii Opera, Vol. II. p. 926.) This is also the creed professed by the Abbe Galiani, a much more dangerous moralist than Kant, because he is aivyays intelligible, and often extremely lively and amusing. “ L’homme est done libre, puisqu’il est intimement persuade de 1’etre, et que cela vaut tout autant que la liberte. Voila done le mechanisme de Vunivers explique clair comme de Veau de roche."" The same author farther remarks, “ La persuasion de la liberte constitue 1’essence de I’homme. On pourroit meme dtTi- nir I’homme un animal qui se croit libre, et ce seroit une definition complete.”—f Corrcspondance de VAbbe. Galiani, Tome l","Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"It is to tlie same practical modification of reason that Kant appeals in favour of the ex¬ istence of the Deity, and of a future state of re¬ tribution, both of which articles of belief he thinks derive the whole of their evidence from the moral nature of man. His system, there¬ fore, as far as I am able to comprehend it, tends rather to represent these as useful credenda, than as certain or even as probable truths. Indeed, the whole of his moral superstructure will he found to rest ultimately on no better basis than the metaphysical conundrum^ that the human mind (considered as a noumenon and not as a phenomenon) neither exists in space nor in time",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"That it was Kant’s original aim to establish a system of scepticism, I am far from being dis¬ posed to think.1 The probability is, that be began with a serious wish to refute the doctrines of Hume; and that, in the progress of his in¬ quiries, he met with obstacles of which he was not aware. It was to remove these obstacles that he had recourse to practical reason ; an idea which has every appearance of being an after¬ thought, very remote from his views when he first undertook his work. This, too, would seem, from the following passage (which I trans¬ late from Degerando), to have been the opinion of one of Kant’s ablest German commentators, M. Reinhold: “ Practical Reason (as Reinhold ingeniously observes) is a wing which Kant has prudently added to his edifice, from a sense of the inadequacy of the original design to answer the intended purpose. It bears a manifest re¬ semblance to what some philosophers call an ap¬ peal to sentiment, founding belief on the neces¬ sity of acting. Whatever contempt Kant may affect for popular systems of philosophy, this manner of considering the subject is not unlike the disposition of those who, feeling their inabi¬ lity to obtain, by the exercise of their reason, a direct conviction of their religious creed, cling to it nevertheless with a blind eagerness, as a support essential to their morals and their hap¬ piness.” [Hist. Comparee, Vol. II. pp. 243, 244.) The extraordinary impression produced for a considerable time in Germany, by the Critique of Pure Reason, is very shrewdly, and I suspect justly, accounted for by the writer last quoted: “ The system of Kant was well adapted to flat¬ ter the weaknesses of the human mind. Curio¬ sity was excited, by seeing paths opened which had never been trodden before. The love of mystery found a secret charm in the obscui’ity which enveloped the doctrine. The long and troublesome period of initiation was calculated to rouse the ambition of bold and adventurous spirits. Their love of singularity was gratified by the new nomenclature; while their vanity exulted in the idea of being admitted into a privi¬ leged sect, exercising, and entitled to exercise, the supreme censorship in philosophy. Even men of the most ordinary parts, on finding themselves called to so high functions, lost sight of their real mediocrity, and conceived them¬ selves transformed into geniuses destined to form a new era in the history of reason","Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant","KG,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany","Asia,Europe"
"<c Another inevitable effect resulted from the universal change operated by Kant in his terms, in his classifications, in his methods, and in the enunciation of his problems. The intellectual powers of the greater part of the initiated were too much exhausted in the course of their long noviciate, to be qualified to judge soundly of the doctrine itself. They felt themselves, after so many windings, lost in a labyrinth, and were unable to dispense with the assistance of the guide who had conducted them so far. Others, after so great a sacrifice, wanted the courage to confess to the world, or to themselves, the dis¬ appointment they had met with. They attached themselves to the doctrine in proportion to the sacrifice they^had made, and estimated its value by the labour it had cost them. As for more superficial thinkers, they drew an inference from the novelty of the form in favour of the novelty of the matter, and from the novelty of the mat¬ ter in favour of its importance",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"“ It is a great advantage for a sect to possess 1 On the contrary, he declares explicitly (and I give him full credit for the sincerity of his words), that he considered his Critique of Pure Reason as the only effectual antidote against the opposite extremes of scepticism and of superstition, as well as against various heretical doctrines which at present infect the schools of philosophy. “ Hac igitur sola (Philosophia Critica) et materialismi, et fatalism!, et Atheismi, et diffid.entiae profanse, et fanatismi, et superstitionis, quorum virus ad universos potest penetrare, tandemque etiam et idealism! et scepticismi, qui magis scholis sunt pestiferi, radices ipsse pos- sunt praecidi.”—(Kant, Prcef. Posterior, p. 35.) I DISSERTATION FIRST",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"199 a distinguishing garb and livery. It was thus that the Peripatetics extended their empire so widely, and united their subjects in one common obedience. Kant had, over and above all this, the art of insisting, that his disciples should belong exclusively to himself. He explicitly announced, that he was not going to found a school of Eclectics, but a school of his own; a school not only independent, but in some measure hostile to every other; that he could admit of no compromise with any sect whatever; that he was come to overturn everything which existed in philosophy, and to erect a new edifice on these immense ruins. The more decided and arrogant the terms were in which he announced his design, the more likely was it to succeed; for the human mind submits more easily to an unlimited than to a partial faith, and yields itself up without reserve, rather than consent to cavil about restrictions and conditions even in favour of its own independence.” With these causes of Kant’s success another seems to have powerfully conspired; the indis- soluble coherence and concatenation of all the different parts of his philosophy. “ It is on this concatenation (says M. Prevost) that the admi¬ ration of Kant’s followers is chiefly founded.” Grant only (they boast) the first principles of the Critical Philosophy, and you must grant the whole system. The passage quoted on this occasion by M. Prevost is so forcibly expressed, that I cannot do it justice in an English version: “ Ab bine enim capitibus fluere necesse est om- nem philosophise criticse rationis pur® vim atque virtutem; namque in ea contextus rerum pror- sus mirabilis est, ita ut extrema primis, media utrisque, omnia omnibus respondeant; si pi'ima dederis danda sunt omnia.”1 No worse ac¬ count could well have been given of a philo¬ sophical Avork on such a subject; nor could any of its characteristical features have been pointed out more symptomatic of its ephemeral reputa¬ tion. Supposing the praise to be just, it repre¬ sented the system, however fair and imposing in its first aspect, as vitally and mortally vulne¬ rable (if at all vulnerable) in every point; and, accordingly, it was fast approaching to its dis¬ solution before the death of its author. In Ger¬ many, at present, we are told, that a pure Kan¬ tian is scarcely to be found.3 But there are many Semi-Kantians and Anti-Kantians, as well as partisans of other schemes built out of the ruins of the Kantian philosophy.3 “ In fine (says a late author), the Critique of Pure Reason, announced with pomp, received with fanaticism, disputed about with fury, after hav¬ ing accomplished the overthrow of the doctrines taught by Leibnitz and Wolff, could no longer support itself upon its own foundations, and has produced no permanent result, but divisions and enmities, and a general disgust at all systemati¬ cal creeds.”4 If this last effect has really re¬ sulted from it (of which some doubts may per¬ haps be entertained), it may be regarded as a favourable symptom of a sounder taste in mat¬ ters of abstract science, than has ever yet pre¬ vailed in that country.5 To these details, I have only to add a re- _1 See some very valuable strictures on Kant, in the learned and elegant sketch of the present state of philosophy, sub¬ joined to M.

"mark of Degeranclo’s, which I have found amply confirmed within the circle of my own experi¬ ence. It might furnish matter for some useful reflections, hut I shall leave my readers to draw their own conclusions from it. 44 Another re¬ markable circumstance is, that the defence of the Kantians turned, in general, not upon the truth of the disputed proposition, but upon the right interpretation of their master’s meaning, and that their reply to all objections has con¬ stantly begun aud ended with these words, You have not understood us.” Among the various schools which have ema¬ nated from that of Kant, those of Fichte and Schelling seem to have attracted among their countrymen the greatest number of proselytes",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Of neither am I able to speak from my own knowledge; nor can I annex any distinct idea to the accounts which are given of their opinions by others. Of Fichte’s speculations about the philosophical import of the pronoun I (Qu’est- ce que le moi ? as Degerando translates the ques¬ tion), I cannot make any thing. In some of his remarks, he approaches to the language of those Cartesians who, in the progress of their doubts, ended in absolute egoism: but the ego1 of Fichte has a creative power. It creates ex¬ istence, and it creates science ; two tilings (by the way) which, according to him, are one and the same. Even my own existence, he tells me, commences only with the reflex act, by which I think of the pure and primitive ego. On this identity of the intelligent ego and the existing ego (which Fichte expresses by the formula ego = ego) all science ultimately rests.—But on this part of his metaphysics it would be idle to en¬ large, as the author acknowledges, that it is not to be understood without the aid of a certain transcendental sense, the want of which is wholly irreparable; a singular admission enough (as Degerando observes), on the part of those criti¬ cal philosophers who have treated with so much contempt the appeal to Common Sense in the writings of some of their predecessors.® 44 In the history of beings there are (according to Fichte) three grand epochs; the first belongs to the empire of chance ; the second is the reign of nature; the third will he the epoch of the existence of God. For God does not exist yet; he only manifests himself as preparing to exist",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"201 as the source of all reality as well as of all science, and in thus transporting the mind into an in¬ tellectual region, inaccessible to men possessed only of the ordinary number of senses, both agree ; and to this vein of transcendental mysti¬ cism may probably be ascribed the extraordinary enthusiasm with which their doctrines appear to have been received by the German youth. Since the time when Degerando wrote, a new and very unexpected revolution is said to have taken place among Schelling’s disciples; many of them, originally educated in the Protestant faith, hav¬ ing thrown themselves into the bosom of the Catholic church1 2 “ The union of the faith¬ ful of this school forms an invisible church, which has adopted for its symbol and watch¬ word, the Virgin Mary; and hence rosaries are sometimes to be seen in the hands of those who reckon Spinoza among the greatest prophets.” It is added, however, with respect to this invi¬ sible church, that <c its members have embraced the Catholic religion, not as the true religion, but as the most poeticala thing not impro¬ bable among a people who have so strong a dis¬ position to mingle together poetry and meta¬ physics in the same compositions.3 But it is painful to contemplate these sad aberrations of human reason; nor would I have dwelt on them so long as I have done, had I not been anxious to convey to my readers a general, but I trust not unfaithful, idea of the style and spirit of a philosophy, which, within the short period of our recollection, rose, flourished, and fell; and which, in every stage of its history, furnished employment to the talents of some of the most learned and able of our contemporaries.3 The space which I have allotted to Kant has so far exceeded what I intended he should oc¬ cupy, that I must pass over the names of many of his countrymen much more worthy of public attention. In the account given by Degerando of the opponents of the Kantian system, some remarks are quoted from different writers, which convey a very favourable idea of the works from which they are borrowed. Among these I would more particularly distinguish those ascribed to Jacobi and to Reinhold. In the Memoirs, too, of the Berlin Academy, where, as Degerando justly observes, the philosophy of Locke found an asylum, while banished from the rest ot Germany, there is a considerable number of metaphysical articles of the highest merit.4 Nor must I omit to mention the contributions to this science by the university of Goettingen ; more especially on questions connected with the philosophy of language. I have great pleasure, also, in acknowledging the entertainment I have received, and the lights I have borrowed from the learned labours of Meiners and of Herder ; but none of these are so closely connected with the history of metaphysics as to justify me in entering into particular details with respect to them. I am ashamed to say that, in Great Bri¬ tain, the only one of these names which has been much talked of is that of Kant; a circum¬ stance which, I trust, will apologise for the length to which the foregoing observations have extended.5 1 See a paper by M.

But, at the time when he wrote, the state of America was more favourable than it now is, or can for a long period be expected to be, to such inquiries as those which engaged his attention; inquiries, by the way, to which his thoughts were evi¬ dently turned, less by the impulse of speculative curiosity, than by his anxiety to defend the theo¬ logical system in which he had been educated, and to which he was most conscientiously and zealously attached. The effect of this anxiety in sharpening his faculties, and in keeping his pole* mical vigilance constantly on the alert, may be traced in every step of his argument.2 In the mean time, a new and unexpected mine of intellectual wealth has been opened to the learned of Europe, in those regions of the East, which, although in all probability the cradle of civilisation and science, were, till very lately, better known in the annals of commerce than of philosophy. The metaphysical and ethical remains of the Indian sages are, in a pe¬ culiar degree, interesting and instructive; inas¬ much as they seem to have furnished the germs of the chief systems taught in the Grecian schools",,IN,8,India,Asia
"The favourite theories, however, of the Hindoos will, all of them, be found, more or less, tinc¬ tured with those ascetic habits of abstract and mystical meditation which seem to have been, in all ages, congenial to their constitutional tem¬ perament. Of such habits, an Idealism, ap¬ proaching to that of Berkeley and Malebranche, is as natural an offspring, as Materialism is of the gay and dissipated manners, which, in great and luxurious capitals, are constantly inviting the thoughts abroad","Of, Berkeley","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"
"205 shall, accordingly, delay any remarks which I have to offer upon them till I enter upon that part of my subject. There are, indeed, some very original and important metaphysical hints scattered over his works; but it is chiefly as an ethical writer that he is known to the world, and that he is entitled to a place among the philosophers of the eighteenth century.1 Among the contemporaries of Dr Hutcheson, there was one Scottish metaphysician (Andrew Baxter, author of the Inquiry into the Nature of the Human SoulJ, whose name it would be im¬ proper to pass over without some notice, after the splendid eulogy bestowed on his work by Warburton. “ He who would see the justest and precisest notions of God and the soul may read this book, one of the most finished of the kind, in my humble opinion, that the present times, greatly advanced in true philosophy, have produced”2 To this unqualified praise, I must confess, I do not think Baxter’s Inquiry altogether entitled, although I readily acknowledge that it displays considerable ingenuity, as well as learning",Warburton,PK,8,Pakistan,Asia
"Among the many very exceptionable doctrines involved in them, there are various discussions, equally refined and solid, in which he has hap¬ pily exemplified the application of metaphysical analysis to questions connected with taste, with the philosophy of jurisprudence, and with the theory of government. Of these discussions some afterwards appeared in a more popular form in his philosophical and literary Essays, and still retain a place in the latest editions of his works; but others, not less curious, have been suppressed by the author, probably from an idea, that they were too abstruse to interest the curiosity of ordinary readers. In some of these practical applications of metaphysical principles, we may perceive the germs of several inquiries which have since been successfully prosecuted by Mr Hume’s countrymen; and, among others, of those which gave birth to Lord Karnes’s Historical Law Tracts, and to his Ele¬ ments of Criticism",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"When Mr Hume, however, attempts to show that the proposition in question is not intuitively certain, his argument appears to me to amount to nothing more than a logical quibble. Of this one would almost imagine that he was not in¬ sensible himself, from the short and slight man¬ ner in which he hurries over the discussion",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"properly an act of the sensitive than of the cogi¬ tative part of our natures.”—[Ibid. p. 321.) The distinction here alluded to between the sensitive and the cogitative parts of our nature (it may be proper to remind my readers) makes a great figure in the works of Cudworth and of Kant. By the former it was avowedly borrowed from the philosophy of Plato. To the latter, it is not improbable, that it may have been sug¬ gested by this passage in Hume. Without dis¬ puting its justness or its importance, I may be permitted to express my doubts of the propriety of stating, so strongly as has frequently been done, the one of these parts of our nature in contrast with the other. Would it not be more philosophical, as well as more pleasing, to con¬ template the beautiful harmony between them, and the gradual steps by which the mind is train¬ ed by the intimations of the former, for the de¬ liberate conclusions of the latter? If, for example, our conviction of the permanence of the laws of nature be not founded on any process of reasoning (a proposition which Mr Hume seems to have established with demonstrative evidence), but be either the result of an instinctive principle of belief, or of the association of ideas, opera¬ ting at a period when the light of reason has not yet dawned, what can be more delightful than to find this suggestion of our sensitive frame.)1 verified by every step which our reason afterwards makes in the study of physical science ; and con¬ firmed with mathematical accuracy by the never- failing accordance of the phenomena of the heavens with the previous calculations of astro¬ nomers ! Does not this afford a satisfaction to the mind, similar to what it experiences, when we consider the adaptation of the instinct of suc¬ tion, and of the organs of respiration, to the physical properties of the atmosphere ? So far from encouraging scepticism, such a view of hu¬ man nature seems peculiarly calculated to silence every doubt about the veracity of our faculties.2 It is not my business at present to inquire into the soundness of Mr Hume’s doctrines on this subject. The rashness of some of them has, in my opinion, been sufficiently shown by more than one of his antagonists. I wish only to re¬ mark the important step which he made, in ex¬ posing the futility of the reasonings by which Hobbes, Clarke, and Locke, had attempted to demonstrate the metaphysical axiom, that “every thing which begins to exist must have a cause;” and the essential service which he rendered to true philosophy, by thus pointing out indirectly 1 Upon either of these suppositions, Mr Hume would, with equal propriety, have referred our anticipation of the future event to the sensitive part of our nature; and, in point of fact, the one supposition would have answered his purpose as well as the other","Kant, Plato","KG,CO",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Asia,South America"
"2 It is but justice to Mr Hume to remark, that, in his later publications, he has himself suggested this very idea as the best solution he could give of his own doubts. The following passage, which appears to me to be eminently philosophical and beautiful, I beg leave to recommend to the particular attention of Kant’s disciples :— “ Here, then, is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas ; and though the powers and forces by which the former is governed be wholly unknown to us, yet our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone on in the same train with the other works of nature. Custom is that principle by which this cor¬ respondence has been effected ; so necessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our conduct in every circumstance and occurrence of human life. Had not the presence of an object instantly excited the idea of those objects commonly conjoined with it, all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our memory and senses; and we should never have been able to adjust means to ends, or employ our natural powers, either to the producing of good, or avoiding of evil. Those who delight in the discovery and contemplation of final causes have here ample subject to employ their wonder and admiration",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"213 to his successors the only solid ground on which that principle is to be defended. It is to this argument of Hume’s, according to Kant’s own acknowledgment, that we owe the Critique of Pure Reason; and to this we are also indebted for the far more luminous refutations of scep¬ ticism by Mr Hume’s own countrymen",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Another of Mr Hume’s attacks on these doc¬ trines was still bolder and more direct. In con¬ ducting it he took his vantage ground from his own account of the origin of our ideas. In this way he was led to expunge from his Philosophi¬ cal Vocabulary every word of which the mean¬ ing cannot he explained by a reference to the impression from which the corresponding idea was originally copied. Nor was he startled in the application of this rule, by the consideration, that it would force him to condemn, as insigni¬ ficant, many words which are to he found in all languages, and some of which express what are commonly regarded as the most important ob¬ jects of human knowledge. Of this number are the words cause and effect; at least, in the sense in which they are commonly understood both by the vulgar and by philosophers. “ One 1 The incidental reference made, by way of illustration, in the following passage, to our instinctive conviction of the per¬ manency of the laws of Nature, encourages me to hope, that, among candid and intelligent inquirers, it is now received as an acknowledged fact in the Theory of the Human Mind",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"2 A foreign writer, of great name (M. Frederick Schlegel), seems to think that the influence of Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature on the Philosophy of England has been still more extensive than I had conceived it to be. His opinion on this point I transcribe as a sort of literary curiosity : “ Since the time of Hume, nothing more has been attempted in England, than to erect all sorts of bulwarks against the practical influence of his destructive scepticism; and to maintain, by various substitutes and aids, the pile of moral prin¬ ciple uncorrupted and entire. Not only with Adam Smith, but with all their late philosophers, national welfare is the ruling and central principle of thought;—a principle excellent and praiseworthy in its due situation, but quite unfitted for being the centre and orach of all knowledge and science."" From the connection in which this last sentence stands with the context, would not one imagine that the writer conceived the Wealth of Nations to be a new moral or metaphysical system, devised by Mr Smith, for the purpose of counteracting Mr Hume’s scepticism ? I have read this translation of Mr Schlegel’s lectures with much curiosity and interest, and flatter myself that we shall soon have English versions of the works of Kant, and of other German authors, from the pens of their English disciples",Kant,"KG,UK,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,N/A,Germany","Asia,N/A,Europe"
"“ I must, therefore, beg of you, most earnest¬ ly, to make no contrast in my favour to the dis¬ paragement of my predecessors in the same pur¬ suits. I can truly say of them, and shall al¬ ways avow, what you are pleased to say of me, that, hut for the assistance I have received from their writings, I never could have wrote or thought what I have done.”1 2 When I reflect on the stress thus laid by Hr Reid on this part of his writings, and his fre¬ quent recurrence to the same argument when¬ ever his subject affords him an opportunity of forcing it upon the attention of his readers, I cannot help expressing my wonder, that Kant and other German philosophers, who appear to have so carefully studied those passages in Reid, which relate to Hume’s Theory of Causation, should have overlooked entirely what he him¬ self considered as the most original and im¬ portant of all his discussions; more especially as the conclusion to which it leads has been long admitted, by the best judges in this island, as one of the few propositions in metaphysical science completely established beyond the reach of controversy. Even those who affect to speak the most lightly of Hr Reid’s contributions to the philosophy of the human mind, have found nothing to object to his reasonings against the ideal theory, but that the absurdities involved in it are too glaring to require a serious ex¬ amination.® Had these reasonings been consi¬ dered in the same light in Germany, it is quite impossible that the analogical language of Leib¬ nitz, in which he speaks of the soul as a living mirror of the universe^ could have been again re¬ vived ; a mode of speaking liable to every ob¬ jection which Reid has urged against the ideal theory. Such, however, it would appear, is the fact. The word Representation (VorstellungJ is 1 An ingenious and profound writer, who, though intimately connected with Mr Hume in habits of friendship, was not blind to the vulnerable parts of his Metaphysical System, has bestowed, in the latest of his publications, the following en¬ comium on Dr Reid’s Philosophical Works",Kant,"DE,KG",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan","Europe,Asia"
"220 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS, now the German substitute for Idea ; nay, one of the most able works which Germany has pro¬ duced since the commencement of its new phi¬ losophical era, is entitled Nova Theoria Facul- tatis Representativce Humana;. In the same work, the author has prefixed, as a motto to the second book, in which he treats of <c the Representative Faculty in general,” the following sentence from Locke, which he seems to have thought himself entitled to assume as a first principle : “ Since the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other immediate object but its own ideas (representationsJ, which it alone does or can contemplate, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them.”—(Locke’s Essay, B. IV. ch. 1.) In a country where this meta¬ physical jargon still passes current among wri¬ ters of eminence, it is vain to expect that any solid progress can be made in the inductive phi¬ losophy of the human mind. A similar remark may be extended to another country, where the title of Ideologie (a word which takes for granted the truth of the hypothesis which it was Reid’s great aim to explode) has been lately given to the very science in which the theory of Ideas has been so clearly shown to have been, in all ages, the most fruitful source of error and absurdity.1 Of the other works by Scottish metaphysi¬ cians, which appeared soon after the Inquiry into the Human Mind, I have not left myself room to speak. I know of none of them from which something important may not be learned; while several of them (particularly those of Dr Camp¬ bell) have struck out many new and interesting views. To one encomium all of them are well entitled, that of aiming steadily at the advance¬ ment of useful knowledge and of human happi¬ ness. But the principles on which they have proceeded have so close an affinity to those of Dr Reid, that I could not, without repeating what I have already said, enter into any ex¬ planation concerning their characteristical doc¬ trines",Of,"DE,TR",8,"Germany,Turkey","Europe,Asia"
"On comparing the opposition which Mr Hume’s scepticism encountered from his own countrymen, with the account formerly given of the attempts of some German philosophers to refute his Theory of Causation, it is impossible not to be struck with the coincidence between the leading views of his most eminent antago¬ nists. This coincidence one would have been disposed to consider as purely accidental, if Kant, by his petulant sneers at Reid, Beattie, and Oswald, had not expressly acknowledged, that he was not unacquainted with their writ¬ ings. As for the great discovery, which he seems to claim as his own,—that the ideas of Cause and Effect, as well as many others, are derived from the pure understanding without any aid from experience, it is nothing more than a repetition, in very nearly the same terms, of what was advanced a century before by Cud- worth, in reply to Hobbes and Gassendi; and borrowed avowedly by Cudworth from the rea¬ sonings of Socrates, as reported by Plato, in answer to the scepticism of Protagoras. This recurrence, under different forms, of the same metaphysical controversies, which so often sur¬ prises and mortifies us in the history of litera¬ ture^ is an evil which will probably always con¬ tinue, more or less, even in the most prosperous state of philosophy. But it affords no objection to the utility of metaphysical pursuits. While the sceptics keep the field, it must not be aban¬ doned by the friends of sounder principles; nor ought they to be discouraged from their un¬ grateful task, by the reflection, that they have probably been anticipated, in everything they have to say, by more than one of their predeces¬ sors. If any thing is likely to check this perio¬ dical return of a mischief so unpropitious to the progress of useful knowledge, it seems to be the general diffusion of that historical informa¬ tion concerning the literature and science of former times, of which it is the aim of these Preliminary Dissertations to present an outline","Kant, Plato","KG,CO,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia,Germany","Asia,South America,Europe"
"This chasm in our information concerning fo¬ reign literature, it may not be a difficult task for younger men to supply. At my time of life it would be folly to attempt it; nor, perhaps, is any author who has himself been so frequently before the public, the fittest person to form an impartial estimate of the merits of his living contemporaries. Now, however, when peace is at length restored to the world, it may reason • ably be hoped that the human mind will again resume her former career with renovated ener¬ gy ; and that the nineteenth century will not 1 Paley’s Natural Theology, p. 324. „ ^ „ , , „ T 2 May I take the liberty of requesting the reader to compare a few pages of Dr Paley s Section on Instinct, beginning “ i am not ignorant of the theory which resolves instinct into sensation,"" &c. with some remarks made by the author ot this Dis¬ sertation, in an Account of the Life and Writings of Dr Reid ? See the passage in section second, beginning thus, In a very original work, on which I have already hazarded some criticisms,"" &c. As both publications appeared about the same time (in the year 1802), the coincidence, in point of thought, must have been wholly accidental, and as such anords no slight presumption in favour of its soundness. , 3 When Dr Paley published his Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, he seems to have attached himselt much too slavishly to the opinions of Bishop Law, to whom that work is inscribed. Hence, probably, his anxiety to disprove the existence of the moral faculty. Of the length to which Law was disposed to carry Locke’s argument against innate prin¬ ciples, he has enabled us to judge by his own explicit declaration : “ I take implanted senses, instincts, appetites, passions, and affections, &c. to be a remnant of the old philosophy, which used to call every thing innate that it could not account tor; and therefore heartily wish, that they were in one sense all eradicated, which was undoubtedly the aim ot that g;reat author last mentioned (Mr Locke), as it was a natural consequence of his first book.”—(Law’s Translation ot Archbishop King On the Origin of Evil, p. 79, note.)

"It has been objected to me, that in the fore¬ going observations on the design of the Prince, I have taken no notice of the author’s vindication of himself and his writings, in his letter to Zenobius Buondelmontius, annexed to the old English translation of Machiavel, printed at London in 1675 and 1680. In the preface to this translation, we are told, that the letter in question “ had never before been published in any language, but lurked for above eighty years in the private cabinets of his own kindred, or the descendants of his admirers in Florence, till, in the Pontificate of Urban VIII., it was procured by the Jesuits and other busy bodies, and brought to Rome with an intention to divert that wise Pope from his design of making one of Nicholas Machiavel’s name and family cardinal, as (not¬ withstanding all their opposition) he did, not long after. When it was gotten into that city, it wanted not those who had the judgment and curiosity to copy it, and so at length came to en¬ joy that privilege which all rare pieces (even the sharpest libels and pasquins) challenge at that court, which is to be sold to strangers, one of which, being a gentleman of this country, brought it over with him at his return from thence in 1645, and having translated it into English, did communicate it to divers of his friends; and by means of some of them, it hath been my good fortune to be capable of making thee a present of it; and let it serve as an apology for our author and his writings, if thou th'nkest he need any.” As the translation of Machiavel, from which Notes this advertisement is copied, is still in the hands uiu *""adi(r.s of many readers in this country, it may not be improper to mention here, that the letter in question is altogether of English fabrication; and (as far as I can learn) is quite unknown on the Continent. It is reprinted at the end of the second volume of Farneworth’s Translation of Machiavel’s works, 1762, with the following statement prefixed to it.1 “ The following letter having been printed in all the editions of the old translation, it is here given to the reader, though it certainly was not written by Machiavel. It bears date in 1537, and his death is placed by all the best historians in 1530. There are, besides, in it many internal marks, which to the judicious will clearly prove it to be the work of some other writer, vainly endeavouring at the style and manner of our excellent author. The letter is indeed a spirited and judicious defence of Machiavel and his writings; but it is written in a style too inflated, and is utterly void of that elegance and precision which so much distinguish the works of the Florentine secretary.” To the author of this last translation we are farther indebted for a very curious letter of Dr Warburton’s, which renders it probable that the forgery was contrived and carried into execution by the Marquis of Wharton.

"Daunou’s Report, I received nearly the same in¬ formation from the north of Italy. It cannot be so well expressed as in the words of the writer :— “ Pray tell Mr Stewart that there is a very remarkable letter of Machiavel’s lately publish¬ ed, written to a private friend at the very time he was engaged in the composition of the Prince, and not only fixing the date of that work, but explaining in a manner disgraceful to the author, the use he made of it, in putting it into the hands of the Medicis family. The letter is besides full of character, and describes, 1 In a letter from Warburton to the Reverend Mr Birch, there is the following passage :—“ I told you, I think, I had several of old Lord Wharton’s papers.

There are the nrinter’s marks on the manuscript, which makes me think it is printed.

But on these rare endowments of his understanding, or the still rarer combination of virtues which shed over all his mental gifts a characteristi- cal grace and a moral harmony, this is not the proper place to enlarge.

"In our own times, Kant and his followers seem to have thought, that they had thrown a new and strong light on the nature of space and also of time, when they introduced the word form (forms of the intellect) as a common term applicable to both. Is not this to revert to the scholastic folly of verbal generalization ? And is it not evident, that of things which are unique (such as matter, mind, space, time) no classifica¬ tion is practicable ? Indeed to speak of classi¬ fying what has nothing in common with any thing else, is a contradiction in terms. It was Notes thus that St Augustine felt, when he said, “ Quid uiu^rnal|ions sit tempus, si nemo quaerat a me, scio; si quis interroget, nescio.” His idea evidently was, that, although he annexed as clear and precise a notion to the word time, as he could do to any ob¬ ject of human thought, he was unable to find any term more general, under which it could be comprehended; and, consequently, unable to give any definition, by which it might be ex¬ plained",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"If the remarks in the text be correct, the cha- racteristical merits of Descartes’ Meditations do not consist in the novelty of the proofs contained in them of the spirituality of the soul (on which point Descartes has added little or nothing to what had been advanced by his predecessors), but in the clear and decisive arguments by which they expose the absurdity of attempting to ex¬ plain the mental phenomena, by analogies bor¬ rowed from those of matter.

"Notwithstanding these and various other si¬ milar coincidences, it has been asserted with some confidence, that Descartes had never read the works of Bacon. “ Quelques auteurs as- surent que Descartes n’avoit point lu les ouvrages de Bacon ; et il nous dit lui-meme dans une de ses letters, qu’il ne lut que fort tard les prin- cipaux ouvrages de Galilee.”—[Ploge de Des¬ cartes, par Thomas.)

"After the pains taken by Descartes to ascer¬ tain the seat of the soul, it is surprising to find one of the most learned English divines of the seventeenth century (Dr Henry More) accusing him as an abettor of the dangerous heresy of nullibism. Of this heresy Dr More represents Descartes as the chief author; and, at the same time, speaks of it as so completely extravagant, that he is at a loss whether to treat it as the se¬ rious opinion of the philosopher, or as the jest of a buffoon. “ The chief author and leader of the Nullibists,” he tells us, “ seems to have been that pleasant wit, Renatus Descartes, who, by his jocular metaphysical meditations, has luxated and distorted the rational faculties of some otherwise sober and quick-witted persons/’ To those who are at all acquainted with the phi¬ losophy of Descartes, it is unnecessary to ob¬ serve, that, so far from being a Nullibist, he valued himself not a little on having fixed the precise uhi of the soul, with a degree of accu¬ racy unthought of by any of his predecessors",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

"The constant influx of information and of libera¬ lity from abroad, which was thus kept up in Scotland in consequence of the ancient habits and manners of the people, may help to account for the sudden burst of genius, which to a foreigner must seem to have sprung up in this country by a sort of enchantment, soon after the Rebellion of 1745. The great step then made was in the art of English composition. In the mathematical sciences, where the graces of writ¬ ing have no place, Scotland, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, was never, from the time of Neper, left behind by any country in Europe; nor ought it to be forgotten, that the philosophy of Newton was publicly taught by David Gregory at Edinburgh, and by his brother James Gregory at St Andrew’s, before it was able to supplant the vortices of Descartes in that very university of which Newton was a member.1 The case was similar in every other liberal pur¬ suit, where an ignorance of the delicacies of the English tongue was not an insuperable bar to distinction. Even in the study of eloquence, as far as it was attainable in their own vernacular idiom, some of the Scottish pleaders, about the era when the two kingdoms were united, seem ambitiously, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to have formed themselves upon models, which, in modern times, it has been commonly suppos¬ ed to be more safe to admire than to imitate.2 Of the progress made in this part of the island 1 For this we have the authority of Whiston, the immediate successor of Sir Isaac Newton in the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge; and of Dr Reid, who was a nephew of the two Gregorys. “ Mr Gregory had already caused several of his scholars to keep Acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian Philosophy ; while we at Cambridge, poor wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesians.”—(Whiston’s Memoirs of his own Life.) “ I have by me,”says Dr Reid, “a Thesis printed at Edinburgh, 1690, by James Gregory, who was at that time Pro¬ fessor of Philosophy at St Andrew’s, containing twenty-five positions; the first three relating to logic, and the abuse of it in the Aristotelian and Cartesian philosophy.

"A similar remark is made by an ancient historian, with respect to the manners of Rome at the period of the Gothic invasion. 46 There are many who do not presume either to bathe, or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of Mercury, and the aspect of the Moon. It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the prophane sceptics, who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a Celestial Power.”—(Gibbon, from Ammianus Marcel- linus, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. V. p. 278.)

"“ In the attempt, indeed, which Kant has made to enumerate the general ideas which are not de¬ rived from experience, but arise out of the pure un¬ derstanding, Kant may well lay claim to the praise of originalityy The object of this problem is thus stated by his friend, Mr Schulze, the au¬ thor of the Synopsis formerly quoted. (The fol¬ lowing translation is by Dr Willich, Elements, &c. p. 45.) “ To investigate the whole store of original notions discoverable in our understanding, and which lie at the foundation of all our knowledge; and at the same time to authenticate their true descent, by showing that they are not derived from experience, but are pure productions of the understanding","Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Kant’s notions of Time are contained in the following seven propositions : 1. Idea temporis non oritur sed supponitur a sensibus. 2. Idea tem¬ poris est singular is, non generalis. Tempus enim quodlibet non cogitatur, nisi tanquam pars unius ejusdem temporis immensi. 3. Idea itaque tem¬ poris est intuitus, et quoniam ante omnem sensa- tionem concipitur, tanquam conditio respectuum in sensibilibus obviorum, est intuitus, non sen- sualis, sed purus. 4. Tempus est quantum conti¬ nuum et legum continui in mutationibus universi principium. 5. Tempus non est objectivum aliquid etreale, nec substantia, necaccidens, necrelatio, sed subjectiva conditio, per naturam mentis humanse necessaria, quaelibet sensibilia, certa lege sibi co- ordinandi, et intuitus purus. 6. Tempus est conceptus verissimus, et, per omnia possibilia sensuum objecta, in infinitum patens, intuitivee repraesentationis conditio. 7. Tempus itaque est Notes principium fonnale mundi sensibilis absolute pri- iuus^ion mum.” With respect to Space, Kant states a series of similar propositions, ascribing to it very nearly the same metaphysical attributes as to Time, and running as far as possible a sort of parallel be¬ tween them. 44 A. Conceptus spatii non abstrahi- tur a sensationibus externis. B. Conceptus spatii est singularis reprcesentatio omnia in se compre- hendens, non sub se continens notio abstracta et communis. C. Conceptus spatii itaque est intuitus purus; cum sit conceptus singularis; sensa¬ tionibus non conflatus, sed omnis sensationis ex- ternae forma fundamentalis. D. Spatium non est aliquid objectivi et realis, nec substantia, nec accidens, nec relatio; sed subjectivum et ideale, e natura mentis stabili lege proficiscens, veluti schema, omnia omnino externe sensa sibi co-ordinandi. E. Quanquam conceptus spatii, ut objectivi alicujus et realis entis vel affectio- nis, sit imaginarius, nihilo tamen secius respec¬ tive ad sensibilia qucecunque, non solum est ve¬ rissimus, sed et omnis veritatis in sensiuilitate externa fundamentum.” These propositions are extracted from a Dis¬ sertation written by Kant himself in the Latin language.1 Their obscurity, therefore, eanno* be ascribed to any misapprehension on the part of a translator. It was on this account that I thought it better to quote them in his own un¬ altered words, than to avail myself of the cor¬ responding passage in Born’s Latin version of the Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Kant, Kant, Born","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"To each of Kant’s propositions concerning Time and Space I shall subjoin a short com¬ ment, following the same order in which these propositions are arranged above",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"281 Notes ejations,” or (as Kant explains himself more Illustrations. cleai'ly in *lis proposition) “ be conceived by the mind prior to all sensation,” is a ques¬ tion which seems to me at least doubtful; nor do I think the opinion we form concerning it a matter of the smallest importance. One thing is certain, that this idea is an inseparable con¬ comitant of every act of memory with respect to past events; and that, in whatever way it is acquired, we are irresistibly led to ascribe to the thing itself an existence independent of the will of any being whatever",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"2. On the second proposition I have nothing to remark. The following is the most intelli¬ gible translation of it that I can give. “ The idea of Time is singular, not general; for any particular length of Time can be conceived only as a part of one and the same immense whole.” 3. From these premises (such as they are) Kant concludes, that the idea of time is intui¬ tive ; and that this intuition, being prior to the exercise of the senses, is not empirical but pure",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"5. In this proposition Kant assumes the truth of that much contested, and, to me, incompre¬ hensible doctrine, which denies the objective reality of time. He seems to consider it merely as a subjective condition, inseparably connected with the frame of the Human Mind, in conse¬ quence of which it arranges sensible phenomena, according to a certain law, in the order of suc¬ cession",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"A. It appears from this, that, in the opinion of Kant, the idea of Space is connate with the mind, or at least, that it is prior to any infor¬ mation received from the senses. But this doc¬ trine seems to me not a little doubtful. Indeed, I rather lean to the common theory, which sup¬ poses our first ideas of Space or Extension to be formed by abstracting this attribute from the other qualities of matter. The idea of Space, howevei*, in whatever manner formed, is mani¬ festly accompanied with an irresistible convic¬ tion, that Space is necessarily existent, and that its annihilation is impossible; nay, it appears to me to be also accompanied with an irresistible conviction, that Space cannot possibly be ex¬ tended in more than three dimensions. Call either of these propositions in question, and you open a door to universal scepticism",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"C. “ The conception of Space, therefore, is a pure intuition.” This follows as a necessary co¬ rollary (according to Kant’s own definition) from Prop. A. What is to be understood by the clause which asserts, that Space is the fun¬ damental form of every external sensation, it is not easy to conjecture. Does it imply merely that the conception of Space is necessarily in¬ volved in all our notions of things external ? In this case, it only repeats over, in different and most inaccurate terms, the last clause of Prop. B",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"What can be more loose and illogical than the phrase external sensation ? D. That Space is neither a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation, may be safely granted; but does it follow from this that it is nothing objective, or, in other words, that it is a mere creature of the imagination ? This, however, would seem to be the idea of Kant; and yet I 2 N 282 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Notes cannot reconcile it with what he says in Prop, illustrations t^iat the conception of Space is the founda- tion of all the truth we ascribe to our percep¬ tions of external objects. (The author’s own words are—omnis veritatis in sensualitate ex¬ terna fundamentum I”)1 2 Upon the whole, it appears to me, that, among these various propositions, there are some which are quite unintelligible; that others assume, as first principles, doctrines which have been dis¬ puted by many of our most eminent philoso¬ phers ; that others, again, seem to aim at in- i volving plain and obvious truths in darkness and mystery; and that not one is expressed with simplicity and precision, which are the na¬ tural results of clear and accurate thinking. In considering time and space as the forms of all sensible phenomena, does Kant mean any thing more but this,—that we necessarily refer every sensible phenomenon to some point of space, or to some instant of time ? If this was really his meaning, he has only repeated over, in obscurer language, the following propositions of Newton; “ Ut or do partium temporis est immutabilis, sic etiam ordo partium spatii. Moveantur hsec de locis suis, et movebuntur (ut ita dicam) de seipsis. Nam tempora et spatia sunt sui ipsorum et rerum omnium quasi loca. In tempore, quoad ordinem successionis; in spatio, quoad ordinem situs locantur universa. De illorum essentia est ut sint loca: et loca primaria mover! absur- dum est.” I have quoted this passage, not from any de¬ sire of displaying the superiority of Newton over Kant, but chiefly to show how very nearly the powers of the former sink to the same level with those of the latter, when directed to inqui¬ ries unfathomable by the human faculties","Kant, Newton, Newton, Kant","KG,US",8,"Kyrgyzstan,United States","Asia,North America"
The following quotation will account for the references which I have made to Mr Nitsch among the expounders of Kant’s Philosophy,Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"il In submitting this fourth Treatise on the Philosophy of Kant to the reader” (says the author of these articles in the Encyclopcedia Londinensis), “ I cannot deny myself the satis¬ faction of publicly acknowledging the great as¬ sistance which I have derived in my literary pur¬ suits, from my excellent and highly valued friend Mr Henry Richter. To him I am indebted for the clearness and perspicuity with which the thoughts of the immortal Kant have been con¬ veyed to the public. Indeed, his comprehensive knowledge of the system, as well as his enthusi¬ astic admiration of its general truth, render him a most able and desirable co-operator. Should, therefore, any good result to mankind from our joint labours in the display of this vast and pro¬ found system, he is justly entitled to his share of the praise. It is with sincere pleasure that I reflect upon that period, now two and twenty years ago, when we first studied together under the same master, Frederic Augustus Nitsch, who 1 Mr Nitsch has remarked this difficulty, and has attempted to remove it. “ The most essential objection (he observes) to Kant’s system is, that it leads to scepticism; because it maintains, that the figures in which we see the external objects clothed are not inherent in those objects, and that consequently space is something within, and not without the mind.” (pp. 144, 145.) “ It may be further objected (he adds), that, if there be no external space, there is also no external world","Kant, Kant, Kant",KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"But this is concluding by far too much from these premises. If there be no external space, it will follow, that we are not authorised to assign extension to external things, but there will follow no more.” (p. 149.) Mr Nitsch then proceeds to obviate these objections ; but his reply is far from satisfactory, and is indeed not less applicable to the doctrine of Berkeley than to that of Kant. This point, however, I do not mean to argue here. The concessions which Nitsch has made are quite sufficient for my present purpose. They serve at least to satisfy my own mind, that I have not misrepresented Kant’s-meaning _ . , , ","Berkeley, Kant, Kant","KG,US",8,"Kyrgyzstan,United States","Asia,North America"
"2 Was it not to avoid the palpable incongruity of this language that Kant was led to substitute the vtora forms instead ot places ; the former word not seeming to be so obviously inapplicable as the latter to time and space in common ; or, to speak more correctly, being, from its extreme vagueness, equally unmeaning when applied to both ?

"Among the secondary mischiefs resulting from the temporary popularity of Kant, none is more to be regretted than the influence of his works on the habits, both of thinking and of writing, of some very eminent men, who have since given to the world histories of philosophy. That of Tenneman in particular (a work said to possess great merit) would appear to have been vitiated by this unfortunate bias in the views of its author. A very competent judge has said of it, that <c it affords, as far as it is completed, the most accurate, the most minute, and the most rational view we yet possess of the different systems of philosophy; but that the critical philosophy being chosen as the vantage ground from whence the survey of former systems is taken, the continual reference in Kant’s own language to his peculiar doctrines, renders it frequently impossible for those who have not Notes studied the dark works of this modern Heracli- iiius^alions tus to understand the strictures of the historian on the systems even of Aristotle or Plato.” (See the article Brucker in the Encyclo- pcedia Britannica, 7th Ed.) We are told by the same writer, that “ among the learned of Germany, Brucker has never enjoyed a very distinguished reputation.” This I can very easily credit; but I am more inclined to in¬ terpret it to the disadvantage of the German taste, than to that of the historian. Brucker is indeed not distinguished by any extraordinary measure of depth or of acuteness; but in indus¬ try, fidelity, and sound judgment, he has few superiors; qualities of infinitely greater value in the undertaker of a historical work, than that passion for systematical refinement, which is so apt to betray the best-intentioned writers into false glosses on the opinions they record","Kant, Kant, Plato","DE,KG,CO",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Europe,Asia,South America"

"Though Cassius was an Epicurean, the true re¬ presentative of that school was the accomplished, prudent, friendly, good-natured timeserver At- ticus, the pliant slave of every tyrant, who could kiss the hand of Antony, imbrued as it was in the blood of Cicero. The pure school of Plato sent forth Marcus Brutus, the signal humanity of whose life was both necessary and sufficient to prove that his daring breach of venerable rules flowed only from that dire necessity which left no other means of upholding the most sacred principles. The Roman orator, though in spe¬ culative questions ho embraced that mitigated doubt which allowed most ease and freedom to his genius, yet in those moral writings where his heart was most deeply interested, followed the severest sect of philosophy, and became al¬ most a Stoic. If any conclusion may he ha¬ zarded from this trial of systems, the greatest which history has recorded, we must not refuse our decided though not undistinguishing pre¬ ference to that noble school which preserved great souls untainted at the court of dissolute and ferocious tyrants; which exalted the slave of one of Nero’s courtiers to he a moral teacher of aftertimes; which for the first, and hitherto for the only time, breathed philosophy and jus¬ tice into those rules of law which govern the ordinary concerns of every man; and which, above all, has contributed, by the examples of Marcus Porcius Cato and of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, to raise the dignity of our species, to keep alive a more ardent love of virtue, and a more awful sense of duty, throughout all ge¬ nerations. 1 4 The result of this short review of the practi¬ cal philosophy of Greece seems to be, that though it was rich in rules for the conduct of life, and in exhibitions of the beauty of virtue, and though it contains glimpses of j ust theory and fragments of perhaps every moral truth, yet it did not leave behind any precise and coherent system; un¬ less we except that of Epicurus, who purchased consistency, method, and perspicuity too dearly by the sacrifice of truth, and by narrowing and lowering his views of human nature, so as to enfeeble, if not extinguish, all the vigorous mo¬ tives to arduous virtue. It is remarkable, that while of the eight Professors who taught in the Porch, from Zeno to Posidonius, everyone either softened or exaggerated the doctrines of his pre¬ decessor ; and while the beautiful and reverend philosophy of Plato had, in his own Academy, degenerated into a scepticism which did not spare morality itself, the system of Epicurus re¬ mained without change; and his disciples con¬ tinued for ages to show personal honours to his memory, in a manner which may seem unac¬ countable among those who were taught to measure propriety by a calculation of palpable _1 Of all testimonies to the character of the Stoics, perhaps the most decisive is the speech of the vile sycophant Ca- pito, in the mock impeachment of Thrasea Paetus, before a senate of slaves: “ Ut quondam C.

"An interval of a thousand years elapsed be¬ tween the close of ancient and the rise of modern philosophy; the most unexplored, yet not the least instructive portion of the history of Euro¬ pean opinion. In that period the sources of the institutions, the manners, the characteristic dis¬ tinctions of modern nations, have been traced by a series of philosophical inquirers from Mon¬ tesquieu to Hal lam; and there also, it may be added, more than among the ancients, are the wellsprings of our speculative doctrines and controversies. Far from being inactive, the hu¬ man mind, during that period of exaggerated darkness, produced discoveries in science, in¬ ventions in art, and contrivances in government, some of which, perhaps, were rather favoured than hindered by the disorders of society, and by the twilight in which men and things were seen. Had Boethius, the last of the ancients, foreseen, that within two centuries of his death, in the province of Britain, then a prey to all the horrors of barbaric invasion, a chief of one of the fiercest tribes of barbarians should trans¬ late into the jargon of his freebooters the work on The Consolations of Philosophy, of which the composition had soothed the cruel imprisonment of the philosophic Roman himself, he must, even amidst his sufferings, have derived some grati¬ fication from such an assurance of the recovery of mankind from ferocity and ignorance. But had he been allowed to revisit the earth in the middle of the sixteenth century, with what wonder and delight might he have contemplated the new and fairer order which was beginning to disclose its beauty, and to promise more than it revealed. He would have seen personal sla¬ very nearly extinguished, and women, first re¬ leased from oriental imprisonment by the Greeks, and raised to a higher dignity among the Ro¬ mans,5 at length fast approaching to due equa¬ lity ; two revolutions the most signal and be¬ neficial since the dawn of civilisation.

"We ought not so much to wonder at the mis¬ takes of men so situated, as that they, without the restraints of the general understanding, and with the clogs of system and establishment, should in so many instances have opened ques¬ tions untouched by the more unfettered ancients, and veins of speculation since mistakenly sup¬ posed to have been first explored in more mo¬ dern times. Scarcely any metaphysical contro¬ versy agitated among recent philosophers was unknown to the schoolmen, unless we except that which relates to liberty and necessity, which would be an exception of doubtful propriety ; for the disposition to it is clearly discoverable in the disputes of the Thomists and Scotists re¬ specting the Augustinian and Pelagian doc¬ trines, 1 although restrained from the avowal of legitimate consequences on either side by the theological authority which both parties acknow¬ ledged. The Scotists steadily affirmed the blame¬ lessness of erroneous opinion; a principle which is the only effectual security for conscientious inquiry, for mutual kindness, and for public quiet. The controversy between the Nominal¬ ists and Realists, treated by some modern wri¬ ters as an example of barbarous wrangling, was in truth an anticipation of that modern dispute which still divides metaphysicians, whether the human mind can form general ideas, and whe¬ ther the words which are supposed to convey such ideas he not general terms, representing only a number of particular perceptions?—ques¬ tions so far from frivolous, that they deeply con¬ cern both the nature of reasoning and the struc¬ ture of language;—on which Hobbes, Berkeley, Hume, Stewart, and Tooke, have followed the Nominalists; and Descartes, Locke, Reid, and Kant, have, with various modifications and some inconsistencies, adopted the doctrine of the Realists.2 3 With the schoolmen appears to have originated the form, though not the substance, of the celebrated maxim, which, whether true or false, is pregnant with systems, <c There is nothing in the understanding which was not be¬ fore in the senses.”5 Ockham4 the Nominalist first denied the Peripatetic doctrine of the exist¬ ence of certain species (since the time of Des¬ cartes called ideas) as the direct objects of per¬ ception and thought, interposed between the mind and outward objects; the modern oppo¬ sition to which by Dr Reid has been supposed to justify the allotment of so high a station to that respectable philosopher. He taught also that we know nothing of mind hut its acts, of which we are conscious. More inclination towards an independent philosophy is to be traced among the schoolmen than might he ex¬ pected from their circumstances. Those who follow two guides will sometimes choose for themselves, and may prefer the subordinate on some occasions. Aristotle rivalled the church; and the church herself safely allowed consider¬ able latitude to the philosophical reasonings of those who were only heard or read in colleges or cloisters, on condition that they neither im¬ pugned her authority, nor dissented from her worship, nor departed from the language of her creeds. The Nominalists were a freethinking sect, who, notwithstanding their defence of kings against the court of Rome, were perse¬ cuted by the civil power. It should not he for¬ gotten that Luther was a Nominalist.5 If not more remarkable, it is more pertinent to our purpose, that the ethical system of the schoolmen, or, to speak more properly, of Aqui¬ nas, as the moral master of Christendom for three centuries, was in its practical part so ex¬ cellent as to leave little need of extensive change, 1 Notes and Illustrations, note I","Berkeley, Kant, Rome","US,KG",8,"United States,Kyrgyzstan","North America,Asia"
"2 Locke speaks on this subject inconsistently ; Keid calls himself a Conceptualist; Kant uses terms so different that he ought perhaps to be considered as of neither party. Leibnitz, varying in some measure from the general spirit of his specu¬ lations, warmly panegyrizes the Nominalists : “ Secta NominaUum, omnium inter scholasticos profundissima, et kodi- ernse reformats philosophandi ration! congruentissima.” (Leibj*.

"It was after forty that he learned the first rudi¬ ments of geometry (so miserably defective was his education); but yielding to the paradoxical disposition apt to infect those who begin to learn after the natural age of commencement, he ex¬ posed himself, by absurd controversies with the masters of a science which looks down with scorn on the Sophist. A considerable portion of his mature age was passed on the Continent, where he travelled as tutor to two successive Earls of Devonshire; a family with whom he seems to have passed near half a century of his long life. In France his reputation, founded at that time solely on personal intercourse, became so great, that his observations on the Meditations of Descartes were published in the works of that philosopher, together with those of Gassendi and Arnauld.1 It was about his sixtieth year that he began to publish those philosophical writings which contain his peculiar opinions;— which set the understanding of Europe into ge¬ neral motion, and stirred up controversies among metaphysicians and moralists, not even yet de¬ termined. At the age of eighty-seven he had the boldness to publish metrical versions of the Iliad and Odyssey, which the greatness of his name, and the singularity of the undertaking, still render objects of curiosity, if not of criti¬ cism. He owed his influence to various causes; at the head of which may be placed that genius for system, which, though it cramps the growth of knowledge,2 perhaps finally atones for that mischief, by the zeal and activity which it rouses among followers and opponents, who discover truth by accident, when in pursuit of weapons for their warfare. A system which attempts a task so hard as that of subjecting vast provinces of human knowledge to one or two principles, if it presents some striking instances of con¬ formity to superficial appearances, is sure to delight the framer; and, for a time, to subdue and captivate the student too entirely for sober reflection and rigorous examination. The evil does not indeed very frequently recur. Perhaps Aristotle, Hobbes, and Kant, are the only per¬ sons who united in the highest degree the great faculties of comprehension and discrimination which compose the Genius of System. Of the three, Aristotle alone could throw it off where it was glaringly unsuitable ; and it is deserving of observation, that the reign of system seems, from these examples, progressively to shorten in proportion as reason is cultivated and knowledge advances. But, in the first instance, consist¬ ency passes for truth. When principles in some instances have proved sufficient to give an un¬ expected explanation of facts, the delighted reader is content to accept as true all other de¬ ductions from the principles. Specious pre¬ mises being assumed to be true, nothing more can be required than logical inference. Mathe¬ matical forms pass current as the equivalent of mathematical certainty. The unwary admirer is satisfied with the completeness and symmetry of the plan of his house—unmindful of the need of examining the firmness of the foundation and the soundness of the materials. The system- maker, like the conqueror, long dazzles and overawes the world; but when their sway is past, the vulgar herd, unable to measure their aston¬ ishing faculties, take revenge by trampling on fallen greatness","Kant, Of","KG,TR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Turkey","Asia,Asia"
"1. The first and most inveterate of these er¬ rors is, that he does not distinguish thought from feeling, or rather that he in express words con¬ founds them. The mere perception of an object, according to him, differs from the pleasure or pain which that perception may occasion, no otherwise than as they affect different organs of the bodily frame. The action of the mind in perceiving or conceiving an object is precisely the same with that of feeling the agreeable or disagreeable.2 The necessary result of this ori¬ ginal confusion is, to extend the laws of the in¬ tellectual part of our nature over that other part of it, hitherto without any adequate name, which feels, and desires, and loves, and hopes, and wills. In consequence of this long confusion, or want of distinction, it has happened that, while the simplest act of the merely intellectual part has many names, (such as sensation, per¬ ception, impression, &c.) the correspondent act of the other not less important portion of man is not denoted by a technical term in philoso¬ phical systems; nor by a convenient word in common language. Sensation has another more common sense. Emotion is too warm for a ge¬ neric term. Feeling has some degree of the same fault, besides its liability to confusion with the sense of touch. Pleasure and pain represent only two properties of this act, which render its re¬ petition the object of desire or aversion; which last states of mind presuppose the act. Of these words, emotion seems to be the least objec¬ tionable, since it has no absolute double mean¬ ing, and does not require so much vigilance in the choice of the accompanying words as would be necessary if we were to prefer feeling; which, however, being a more familiar word, may, with due caution, be also sometimes em¬ ployed. Every man who attends to the state of his own mind will acknowledge, that these words, emotion and feeling, thus used, are perfect¬ ly simple, and as incapable of further explana¬ tion by words as sight or hearing; which may indeed be rendered into synonymous words, but never can be defined by any more simple or more clear. Reflection will in like manner teach that perception, reasoning, and judgment may be conceived to exist without being followed by emotion. Some men hear music without gratifi¬ cation : one may distinguish a taste without being pleased or displeased by it; or at least the relish or disrelish is often so slight, without lessening the distinctness of the sapid qualities, that the distinction of it from the perception cannot be doubted",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

Though the last four writers cannot be considered as properly polemics, their labours were excited, and their doctrines modified, by the stroke from a vigorous arm which seemed to shake Ethics to its foundation. They lead us far into the eighteenth century; and their works, occasioned by the doctrines of Hobbes, sowed the seed of the ethical writings of Hume, Smith, Price, Kant, and Stewart; in a less degree, also, of those of Tucker and Paley: not to mention Mandeville, the buffoon and sophister of the ale-house; or Helvetius, an ingenious but flimsy writer, the low and loose moralist of the vain, the selfish, and the sensual","Cumberland, Kant, Tucker, Mandeville","US,KG,JM",8,"United States,Kyrgyzstan,Jamaica","North America,Asia,North America"
"From this principle he deduces the rules of mo¬ rality, which he calls the Laws of Nature. The surest, or rather only mark that they are the commandments of God, is, that their observance promotes the happiness of man : for that reason alone could they he imposed by that Being whose essence is love. As our moral faculties must to us be the measure of all moral excellence, he infers that the moral attributes of the Divinity must in theirnatureheonly a transcendent degree of those qualities which we most approve, love, and revere, in those moral agents with whom we are familiar. * He had a momentary glimpse of the possibility that some human actions might he performed with a view to the happiness of others, without any consideration of the pleasure reflected back on ourselves.3 But it is too faint and transient to he worthy of observation, other¬ wise than as a new proof how often great truths must flit before the understanding, before they can be firmly and finally held in its grasp. His only attempt to explain the nature of the moral faculty, is the substitution of practical reason (a phrase of the schoolmen, since become celebrat¬ ed from its renewal by Kant) for right reason ;4 and his definition of the first, as that which points out the ends and means of action. Throughout his whole reasoning, he adheres to the accustom¬ ed confusion of the quality which renders actions virtuous, with the sentiments excited in us by the contemplation of them.

"For a time the work was admired more undis- tinguishingly than its literary character war¬ rants. In the succeeding period it was justly criticised, hut too severely condemned. Of late, more unjustly than in either of the former cases, it has been generally neglected. It seemed to have the power of changing the temper of its critics. It provoked the amiable Berkeley to a harshness equally unwonted and unwarranted;1 2 while it softened the rugged Warburton so far as to dispose the fierce yet not altogether un¬ generous polemic to praise an enemy in the very heat of conflict.8 Leibnitz, the most celebrated of Continental philosophers, warmly applauded the Character¬ istics, and, (what was a more certain proof of admiration) though at an advanced age, cri¬ ticised that work minutely.3 * * * * Le Cl ere, who had assisted the studies of the author, contri¬ buted to spread its reputation by his Journal, then the most popular in Europe. Locke is said to have aided in his education, probably rather by counsel than by tuition. The author had indeed been driven from the regular stu¬ dies of his country by the insults with which he was loaded at Winchester school, when he was only twelve years old, immediately after the death of his grandfather; a choice of time which seemed not so much to indicate anger against the faults of a great man, as triumph over the principles of liberty, which seemed at that time to have fallen for ever. He gave a gen¬ uine proof of respect for freedom of thought, by preventing the expulsion, from Holland, of Bayle, (with whom he differs in every moral, political, and, it may be truly added, religious opinion) when, it must be owned, the right of asylum was, in strict justice, forfeited by the se¬ cret services which the philosopher had rendered to the enemy of Holland and of Europe. In the small part of his short life which premature infirmities allowed him to apply to public affairs, he co-operated zealously with the friends of freedom; but, as became a moral philosopher, he supported, even against them, a law to allow those who were accused of treason to make their defence by counsel, although the parties first to benefit from this act of imperfect justice were conspirators to assassinate King William, and to re-enslave their country. On that occasion it is well known with what admirable quickness he took advantage of the embarrassment which seized him, when he rose to address the House of Commons. “ If I,” said he, “ who rise only to give my opinion on this bill, am so confound¬ ed that I cannot say what I intended, what must the condition of that man be, who, with¬ out assistance, is pleading for his own life !” He was the friend of Lord Somers; and the tribute paid to his personal character by Warburton, who knew many of his contemporaries and some of his friends, may be considered as evidence of its excellence","Of, Berkeley, Warburton, Winchester, Holland, Holland, Warburton","US,PK,TR",8,"United States,Pakistan,Turkey","North America,Asia,Asia"
"2 It is remarkable that the most impure passages of Warburton’s composition are those in which he lets loose his contro¬ versial zeal, and that he is a fine writer principally where he writes from generous feeling. “ Of all the virtues which were so much in this noble writer’s heart and in his writings, there was not one he more revered than the love of public liberty","Warburton, Of","PK,TR",8,"Pakistan,Turkey","Asia,Asia"

"Grace belongs only to natural movements; and Lord Shaftesbury, notwithstanding the frequent beauty of his thoughts and language, has rarely attained it. He is unfortunately prone to plea¬ santry, which is obstinately averse from con¬ straint, and which he had no interest in raising to be the test of truth. His affectation of liveliness as a man of the world, tempts him sometimes to overstep the indistinct boundaries which sepa¬ rate familiarity from vulgarity. Of his two more considerable writings, the Moralists, on which he evidently most valued himself, and which is spoken of by Leibnitz with enthusiasm, is by no means the happiest. Yet perhaps there is scarcely any composition in our language more lofty in its moral and religious sentiments, and more exquisitely elegant and musical in its diction, than the Platonic representation of the scale of beauty and love, in the speech to Palemon, near the close of the first part.1 * Many passages might be quoted, which in some measure justify the enthusiasm of the septuage¬ narian geometer. Yet it is not to be concealed that, as a whole, it is heavy and languid. It is a modern antique. The dialogues of Plato are often very lively representations of conversations which might take place daily at a great univer¬ sity, full, like Athens, of rival professors and eager disciples,—^between men of various character, and great fame as well as ability. Socrates runs through them all. His great abilities, his still more venerable virtues, his cruel fate, especially when joined to his very characteristic pecu¬ liarities,—to his grave humour, to his homely sense, to his assumed humility, to the honest sliness with which he ensnared the Sophists, and to the intrepidity with which he dragged them to justice, gave unity and dramatic inter¬ est to these dialogues as a whole. But Lord Shaftesbury’s dialogue is between fictitious per¬ sonages, and in a tone at utter variance with English conversation. He had great power of thought and command over words. But he had no talent for inventing character and bestowing life on it. The Inquiry concerning Virtue* is nearly exempt from the faulty peculiarities of the author; the method is perfect, the reasoning just, the style precise and clear. The writer has no purpose but that of honestly proving his prin¬ ciples; he himself altogether disappears; and he is intent only on earnestly enforcing what he truly, conscientiously, and reasonably believes","Of, Plato, Athens","TR,CO,US,UK",8,"Turkey,Colombia,United States,N/A","Asia,South America,North America,N/A"
"His general principles of Ethics may be shortly stated in his own words :—“ As God is a being of infinite goodness, his end is the good of his creatures. The general wellbeing of all men of all nations, of all ages of the world, is that which he designs should be procured by the concur¬ ring actions of each individual.” Having stated that this end can be pursued only in one of two ways—either by computing the consequences of each action, or by obeying rules which generally tend to happiness—and having shown the first to be impossible, he rightly infers, “ that the end to which God requires the concurrence of human actions, must be carried on by the ob¬ servation of certain determinate and universal rules or moral precepts, which in their own na¬ ture have a necessary tendency to promote the wellbeing of mankind, taking in all nations and ages, from the beginning to the end of the world.”8 A romance, of which a journey to an Utopia, in the centre of Africa, forms the chief part, called The Adventures of Signor Gau- dentio di Lucca, has been commonly ascribed to him; probably on no other ground than its union of pleasing invention with benevolence and ele¬ gance.5 Of the exquisite grace and beauty of his diction, no man accustomed to English com¬ position can need to be informed. His works are, beyond dispute, the finest models of phi¬ losophical style since Cicero. Perhaps they surpass those of the orator, in the wonderful art by which the fullest light is thrown on the most minute and evanescent parts of the most subtile of human conceptions. Perhaps he also surpassed Cicero in the charm of sim¬ plicity, a quality eminently found in Irish wri¬ ters before the end of the eighteenth century; conspicuous in the masculine severity of Swift, 1 Siris, or Reflections on Tar Water","Lucca, Of, Cicero, Cicero","US,IT,TR,UK,IE",8,"United States,Italy,Turkey,N/A,Ireland","North America,Europe,Asia,N/A,Europe"

"3 “ Si nobis, cum ex hac vita migraverimus, in beatorum insulis, ut fabulae ferunt, immortale sevum degere liceret, quid opus esset eloquentia, cum judicia nulla fierent ? aut ipsis etiam virtutibus ? Nec enim fortitudine indigeremus, nullo pro- posito aut laboreaut periculo; nec justitia, cum esset nihil quod appeteretur alieni; nec temperantia, quae regeret eas quae nullae essent libidines: ne prudentia quidem egeremus, nullo proposito delectu bonorum et malorum. Una igitur essemus beati cogmtioneyerum et scientia.” (Cicero. Fragm. ap. Augustin, de Trinit. iv. 2.) Cicero is more extensive, and therefore more consistent, than Hume ; but his enumeration errs both by excess and defect. He supposes knowledge to render beings happy in this imaginary state, without stooping to inquire how. He omits a virtue which might well exist in it, though we cannot conceive its formation in such a state—the delight in each other’s wellbeing ; and he omits a conceivable though unknown vice, that of unmixed ill-will, which would render such a state a hell to the wretch who harboured the malevolence","Una, Cicero, Cicero","US,IN",8,"United States,India","North America,Asia"

In a science more difficult, because both ascend¬ ing to more simple general principles, and run¬ ning down through more minute applications, though the success of Smith has been less com¬ plete, his genius is not less conspicuous. Per¬ haps there is no ethical work since Cicero’s Of¬ fices, of which an abridgement enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the Theory of Moral Sentiments. This is not chiefly owing to the beauty of diction, as in the case of Cicero; but to the variety of explanations of life and manners which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, on the other hand, it must be owned that, for pure¬ ly philosophical purposes, few hooks more need abridgement: for the most careful reader fre¬ quently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations. The naturally copious and flow¬ ing style of the author is generally redundant, and the repetition of certain formularies of the system is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous. Per¬ haps Smith and Hobbes may be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our philosophy; the first of graceful fulness falling •into flaccidity; while the masterly concision of the second is oftener tainted by dictatorial dry¬ ness.

"Long after the death of Dr Reid, his philoso¬ phy was taught at Paris by M. Royer Collard,1 who, on the restoration of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his nation, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His inge¬ nious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls <c the sage and timid” doctrines of Edinburgh, which he con¬ sidered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of “ such a masculine and brilliant character as might command the attention of Europe, and be able to struggle with success on a great theatre, against the genius of the adverse school.”* It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense nomen¬ clature, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The prefer¬ ence of the more boastful system, over a philo¬ sophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest preten¬ sions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its in¬ fluence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many supporters : and, in¬ deed, the accomplished Professor himself rapid¬ ly shot through Kantianism, and now appears to rest or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to descry from it any distinction between objects, —even that indispensable distinction between Reality and Illusion.

"“ The apparent coldness and selfishness of man¬ kind may be traced, in a great measure, to a want of attention and a want of imagination. In the case of those misfortunes which happen to ourselves or our near connections, neither of these powers is necessary to make us acquainted with our situation. But without an uncommon degree of both, it is impossible for any man to comprehend completely the situation of his neighbour, or to have an idea of the greater part of the distress which exists in the world. If we feel more for ourselves than for others, in the former case the facts are more fully be¬ fore us than they can be in the latter.”8 Yet several parts of his writings afford the most satisfactory proof, that his abstinence from w hat is commonly called metaphysical speculation, arose from no inability to pursue it with sig¬ nal success. As examples, his observations on General Terms, and on Causation, may be ap¬ pealed to with perfect confidence. In the first two Dissertations of the volume bearing the title of Philosophical Essays, he with equal boldness and acuteness grapples with the most extensive and abstruse questions of mental philosophy, and points out both the sources and the uttermost boundaries of human knowledge with a Verula- mean hand. In another part of his writings, he calls what are denominated first principles of experience, “fundamental laws of human belief, or primary elements of human reason;”5 which last form of expression has so close a resemblance to the language of Kant, that it should have pro¬ tected the latter from the imputation of writing jargon",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"There must be primary pleasures, pains, and even appetites, which arise from no prior state of mind, and which, if explained at all, can he derived only from bodily organization; for if there were not, there could he no secondary de¬ sires. What the number of the underived prin¬ ciples may be, is a question to which the an¬ swers of philosophers have been extremely va¬ rious, and of which the consideration is not necessary to our present purpose. The rules of philosophizing, however, require that causes should not he multiplied without necessity. Of two explanations, therefore, which give an equally satisfactory account of appearances, that theory is manifestly to be preferred which sup¬ poses the smaller number of ultimate and inex¬ plicable principles. This maxim, it is true, is subject to three indispensable conditions. 1",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"These remarks are not so much intended to he applied to the moral doctrines of that school, considered in themselves, as to those apparent de¬ fects in the prevailing systems of Ethics through¬ out Europe, which seem to have suggested the necessity of their adoption. Kant has himself acknowledged that his whole theory of the per¬ cipient and intellectual faculty was intended to protect the first principles of human knowledge against the assaults of Hume. In like manner, his ethical system is evidently framed for the purpose of guarding certain principles, either directly governing, or powerfully affecting prac¬ tice, which seemed to him to have been placed on unsafe foundations by their advocates, and which were involved in perplexity and con¬ fusion, especially by those who adapted the re¬ sults of various and sometimes contradictory systems to the taste of multitudes, more eager to know than prepared to be taught. To the theoretical reason he superadded the practical reason, which had peculiar laws and prin¬ ciples of its own, from which all the rules of morals may be deduced. The practical reason cannot be conceived without these laws; there¬ fore they are inherent. It perceives them to he necessary and universal. Hence, by a process not altogether dissimilar, at least in its gross re¬ sults, to that which was employed for the like purpose by Cudworth and Clarke, by Price, and in some degree by Stewart, he raises the social affections, and still more the moral sentiments, above the sphere of enjoyment, and beyond that series of enjoyments which is called happiness",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"By the same intuition we discover that virtue deserves happiness; and as this desert is not uniformly so requited in the present state of existence, it compels us to believe a moral go¬ vernment of the world, and a future state of ex¬ istence, in which all the conditions of the prac¬ tical reason will be realized;-—truths, of which, in the opinion of Kant, the argumentative proofs were at least very defective, but of which the revelations of the practical reason afforded a more conclusive demonstration than any process of reasoning could supply. The understanding, he owned, saw nothing in the connection of mo¬ tive with volition different from what it discover¬ ed in every other uniform sequence of a cause and an effect. But as the moral law delivered by the practical reason issues peremptory and DISSERTATION SECOND",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"Strictly, the human infant is horn neither self¬ ish nor social; hut the far greater part acquire some provident regard to their own welfare, and a number, probably not much smaller, feel some sparks of affection towards others. On our principles, therefore, as much as on those of Kant, human nature is capable of disinterested sentiments. For we too allow and contend that our moral faculty is a necessary part of human nature,—that it universally exists in human beings,—that we cannot conceive any moral agents without qualities which are either like, or produce the like effects. It is necessarily re¬ garded by us as co-extensive with human, and even with moral nature. In what other sense can universality he predicated of any proposition not identical ? Why should it be tacitly assumed that all these great characteristics of conscience should necessarily presuppose its being unformed and underived? What contradiction is there between them and the theory of regular and uniform formation ? In this instance it should seem that a general assent to truth is chiefly if not solely obstructed by an inveterate prejudice, arising from the mode in which the questions relating to the af¬ fections and the moral faculty have been dis¬ cussed among ethical philosophers. Generally speaking, those who contend that these parts of the mind are acquired, have also held that they are, in their perfect state, no more than modi¬ fications of self-love. On the other hand, philo¬ sophers “ of purer fire,” who felt that conscience is sovereign, and that affection is disinterested, have too hastily fancied that their ground was untenable, without contending that these quali¬ ties were inherent or innate, and absolutely un¬ derived from any other properties of mind. If a choice were necessary between these two systems as masses of opinion, without any freedom of dis¬ crimination and selection, I should unquestion¬ ably embrace that doctrine which places in the clearest light the reality of benevolence and the authority of the moral faculty. But it is surely easy to apply a test which may he applied to our conceptions as effectually as a decisive experiment is applied to material substances. Does not he who, whatever he may think of the origin of these parts of human nature, believes that actually conscience is supreme, and affection terminates in its direct object, retain all that for which the partisans of the underived principles value and cling to their system ? “ But they are made,” these philosophers may say, “ by this class of our antagonists, to rest on insecure foundations",Kant,KG,8,Kyrgyzstan,Asia
"“ For,” he asks, “ why is it right to obey the will of God ? Is it because our moral faculties perceive it to be right ? But they equally per¬ ceive and feel the authority of all the primary principles of morality; and if this answer be made, it is obvious that those who make it do in effect admit the independence of moral distinc¬ tions on the will of God.” “ If God,” said Ockham, “ had commanded his creatures to hate himself, hatred of God would have been praiseworthy.” (Domin. Soto de Justitia et Jure, lib. ii. qusest. 3, “ Utrum pree- cepta Decalogi sint dispensabiliaa book dedi¬ cated to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II.) Suarez, the last scholastic philosopher, rejected the Ock- hamical doctrine, but allowed will to be a part of the foundation of morality. “ Voluntas Dei non est tota ratio bonitatis aut malitise.” (Suarez de Legibus, lib. ii. 66, p. 71. edit. Lond. 1679.) As the great majority of the Schoolmen sup¬ ported their opinion of this subject by the con¬ sideration of eternal and immutable ideas of right and wrong in the divine intellect, it was natural that the Nominalists, of whom Ockham was the founder, who rejected all general ideas, should also have rejected those moral distinc¬ tions which were then supposed to originate in such ideas.

"Of Enoch we find it recorded, that he “ walked with God,” that is, led a life of eminent holiness, and was so far favoured, as to be withdrawn from the earth without tasting of death. And he is referred to, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, as an example oifaith, inasmuch as “ without faith it is impossible to please God.” But as to the sub¬ jects of his faith, the Apostle himself seems to have had no distinct and particular knowledge, except that he must have believed in the exist¬ ence and in the goodness of God,—“ For he that cometh to God must believe that He is ; and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.” Of course what is meant in this passage by the word “ God,” is—what we also understand by it—the Creator of the world. We cannot doubt that He must have made Himself known to the earliest of mankind, as the Maker of themselves, and of all things around them.

And this, he says, was on ac¬ count of their being worshippers only of ONE, whom they called Cneph, “ the unbegotten God.”1 And the plagues inflicted on Egypt by the Lord God of Israel,2 the complete dominion He dis¬ played over the Beings the idolaters worshipped, must, no doubt, have brought some of the Egyp¬ tians to acknowledge and worship Him.

"Some of these commandments related to reli¬ gious ceremonies or observances, such as the keep¬ ing of the Feast of the Passover—coming up to the Temple at Jerusalem three times a-year— abstaining from certain meats, and wearing cer¬ tain peculiar garments ; with other things of that kind. These are commonly called ceremonial laws","Temple, Jerusalem","US,IL",8,"United States,Israel","North America,Asia"
"Of this kind was the law that no man should part with his landed property finally, but that, if sold, it should return to him, or his heirs, at the jubilee; and thatwrhich directed thatamanshould marry his brother’s widow if his brother died childless (Deut. xxv. 5, and Luke xx. 29), with many other such laws",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Again, the Mosaic Law was distinguished from every other revelation ever bestowed on man, by the great number and minuteness of its regula¬ tions, and the multitude of its ceremonial obser¬ vances. It gives exact directions to the Israel¬ ites as to their diet, their dress, and their mode of life in many particulars",,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"The nation of Israel was, as we have said, placed under an extraordinary providence, which allotted to them victory or defeat,—plenty or fa¬ mine,—and other temporal blessings and punish¬ ments, according to their conduct. And these were the rewards and punishments that formed the sanction of the Mosaic Law. As for a future state of retribution in another world, Moses said nothing to the Israelites about that. Whatever may at any time have been revealed to himself, and to some other highly favoured individuals, on that subject, it does not appear that he was com¬ missioned to deliver to the people any revelation at all concerning a future state. This was reserv¬ ed for a GREATER than Moses, and for a more glo¬ rious dispensation than his Law'. For as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews “ the law made nothing perfect; but the bringing in of a better hope did” (Heb. x.)—namely, the promises given through “ Jesus Christ, who brought life and im¬ mortality to light, through the GospeV W hy Moses was not instructed to reveal this momentous truth, is a question which will natu¬ rally occur to every one. It is a question which we are not competent completely to answer; be¬ cause, as has been elsewhere observed, we cannot presume to explain why the Gospel was reserved for that precise period at which it was proclaim¬ ed. But that inquiry,—why a different and more imperfect dispensation was needful to prepare the way for the Gospel,—being waived, as one sur¬ passing man’s knowledge and pow'ers, it is easy to perceive that the revelation of the doctrine in the Mosaic Law would have been neither neces¬ sary nor proper. It was not necessary for the pur¬ pose of affording a sanction to the Law of Moses, because the Israelites alone, of all the nations of the world, were, as we have seen, under an ex¬ traordinary providence",,IL,8,Israel,Asia

"Yet some of the prophecies relating to the Christ’s kingdom, do contain allusions to the in¬ troduction of a new religion, distinct from that taught by Moses. The most decisive of these prophecies, in relation to this point, is that of Jeremiah,—“ Behold the days come [are com¬ ing] saith the Lord, that I will make a NEW COVENANT with the House of Israel * * * * not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,'"" &c",,IL,8,Israel,Asia

"One necessary circumstance in such a Dispen¬ sation, was, that it should not be like the Mosaic, a local religion. The Jews, indeed, clung (and still cling) to the notion that, even when all the world should be brought to the knowledge of the true God, still their nation should have a pre¬ eminence; and that the Temple of Jerusalem should be the great centre of religious worship for all mankind. And we know there are even some Christians who expect that Jesus Christ is to return to this earth in bodily person, and reign at Jerusalem in great worldly splendour for a thousand years. But such notions are quite at variance with the whole character of the Gospel, as described in our Sacred Books","Temple, Jerusalem, Jerusalem","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"The Temple at Jerusalem—“ the place which the Lord had chosen to cause his NAME to dwell there,”2 that is, to manifest his presence—was to be totally and finally destroyed. And Jesus de¬ clared, that “ wheresoever even two or three should be gathered together in his name, He would be there in the midst of them.” And hence, a Christian congregation—not a literal building—was to be henceforth a portion of the temple of the MOST HIGH",Jerusalem,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"And this, by the way, is a clear proof of his claiming a divine character. For the Jews un¬ derstood (as He well knew) by “the temple of the Lord,” not a synagogue,—a place of assembly for worshippers, but “ the habitation where his honour (glory) dwelleth.” And it is worth remarking, that they also un¬ derstood his calling Himself the “ Son of God,” 1 The word Christian (X^artowos) occurs hut three times in the New Testament, Acts xi. 26, xxvi. 28 ; 1 Peter iv. 16  In no one of these places do we find it applied by Christians themselves to one another. It is mentioned as a name first given to the disciples at Antioch in Syria, doubtless by the Romans, as the word is of Latin formation. King Agrippa, again, uses the word in speaking to Paul, and the Apostle Peter introduces it as denoting what was accounted a crime by the heathen rulers. “ If any man suffer for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed.” 2 There are two words in the original which are both translated “ Temple,” 'isjav, that is, the “ sacred place,” which in¬ cluded the courts of the Temple; and Nao;, (from Nk;&>, “ to dwell,”) the “ House of God,” which was the building in which sacrifices were offered. For this was the main purpose of a temple ; which was not (like the synagogues, and like our churches and chapels) a place for religious assemblies","Antioch, Temple, Temple","US,SY",8,"United States,Syrian Arab Republic","North America,Asia"
"And the Apostles, accordingly, speak of “the LORD (that is, Jesus Christ) being the Spirit (2 Cor. iii. 17), and assure us that “ if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.1’ (Rom. viii. 9.) The same God, then, who to the Israelites, was made known only as Creator and Governor (God the Father), was afterwards manifested to Chris¬ tians as being also the Redeemer (God the Son), and the Sanctifier (God theHoly Ghost): and He is to be acknowledged by them in this threefold manifestation, according to our Saviour’s injunc¬ tion to “ baptise in2 the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” There have been, therefore, in all, three Temples of the ONE GOD ; first, under the Old Dispensation, the Temple at Jerusalem; second¬ ly, during the abode on earth of the Lord Jesus, “ the Temple of his Body;” and, thirdly, (that which is also often called Christ’s body,) (Eph","Temple, Jerusalem, Temple","US,IL",8,"United States,Israel","North America,Asia"
"Nor, again, does it mean that all Christians belong, or ought to belong, to some one society on earth. For this is what the Apostles never aimed at, and what never was actually the state of things, from the time that the Christian reli¬ gion extended beyond the city of Jerusalem",Jerusalem,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"487 clearly is, that believers on earth are part of a great society (church or congregation), of which the Head is in heaven, and of which many of the members only “ live unto God,” or exist in his counsels,—some having long since departed, and some being not yet born. Of such a community the centre cannot possibly be on earth; and, ac¬ cordingly, the Apostle Paul expressly distin¬ guishes the Christian church [assembly or con¬ gregation] IxxXnria, from that of Israel:—“ Ye [that is, ye Christians] are not come to the mount that might be touched; [as the Israelites were collected in a great assembly (those of them that ivere alive that day) round Sinai, as a holy place on earth] .... but ye are come to Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the hea¬ venly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant” (Heb. xii. 18-24). So, in the Epistle to the Galatians,—“ Mount Sinai an- swereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children ; but Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” (Gal. iv. 25, 26.) The Universal Church of Christ may therefore be said to be ONE in reference to HIM, its su¬ preme Head in heaven ; but it is not one Com¬ munity on earth. And even so the Human race is one, in respect of the one Creator and Gover¬ nor ; but this does not make it one Family, or one State","Of, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem","IL,TR",8,"Israel,Turkey","Asia,Asia"
"Any one who looks at the account of Paul’s taking leave of the Elders of Ephesus and Miletus (Acts xx.), whom he expected never to see again, will plainly see that he could not possibly have had any notion of any supreme central authority, lodged either in the church of Jerusalem, or of Rome, or in Peter and his successors, or in any General Council. For he there directly foretells that false teachers should arise out of their own body [that is, from amongst the clergy], and anxi¬ ously impresses on them the best advice he could think of for guarding against such a danger. Yet that advice is only to watch, and remember what he had taught them. This seems to imply that each particular church was left sufficient means within itself of ascertaining the true doctrine of Christ, continuing, and preserving it; but that the actual preservation of such doctrine depended on the watchfulness of the churches themselves","Jerusalem, Rome","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"In the beginning of the Revelation of John, too, we find the Lord addressing each of the seven churches of Asia as severally independent of any earthly power, and responsible to Him alone for their conduct as Christian churches",Asia,PH,8,Philippines,Asia
"Now, there did exist something of this kind under the Mosaic Dispensation. The “ devout Gentiles” (sometimes called “ Proselytes1 of the Gate”), were admitted to worship in the outer court of the Temple, and to frequent the Syna¬ gogues. Those who had embraced the whole Mosaic Law (who were called “ Proselytes of righteousness”) were accounted as ranking higher than the others, and next in holiness to the Israel¬ ites by birth. Then, of the born Israelites, the Levites were more especially dedicated to the Lord than those of the other Tribes, and were em¬ ployed in his immediate Service about the Taber¬ nacle, or the Temple. Of the Levites themselves, again, the family of Aaron were alone admissible to the priesthood. And lastly, of the Priests themselves, none except the high priest was per¬ mitted to enter the Holy of Holies,—where he offered the yearly sacrifice on the great day of atonement","Temple, Temple, Of","US,IL,TR",8,"United States,Israel,Turkey","North America,Asia,Asia"
"ESTABLISHMENT OE When the bodily presence of our Divine Mas¬ ter was withdrawn from the earth, his Apostles proceeded, according to his directions, to establish “ the kingdom of heaven,” over which He had placed them, saying, “ I appoint unto you a king¬ dom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.” For, that Gospel which had been proclaimed by Himself and his disciples, during his personal ministry, was, that “ the kingdom of heaven was at hand.” That kingdom was then only in prepa¬ ration. It was not completely begun, till the Apostles, after the outpouring on them of the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost, founded at Jerusalem the first Christian church, and bap¬ tized into the Name of the Lord Jesus about three thousand persons, who were thus enrolled as sub¬ jects of that kingdom",Jerusalem,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"The number of these in Jerusalem increased rapidly. Other churches were established in Judea, in Galilee, in Samaria, and elsewhere",Jerusalem,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"Even after the call of the idolatrous Gentiles, it appears plainly to have been the practice of the Apostles Paul and Barnabas, when they came to any city in which there was a synagogue, to go thither first and deliver their sacred message to the Jews, and “devout (or proselyte) Gentiles;”— according to their own expression (Acts xiii. 16); to the “ men of Israel,” and those “ that feared God f—adding, that “it was necessary that the word of God should first be preached to them.” And when they founded a church in any of those cities in which (and such were probably a very large majority) there was no Jewish Syna¬ gogue that received the Gospel, it is likely they would still conform in a great measure to the same model",,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"The same inference may be drawn from a fact which we have already spoken of, the entire absence in the New Testament of the title of Christians, as applied by themselves to each other. It seems to have been adopted by Christians very early ; probably soon after the destruction of Jerusalem; and if the Books of the New Testament had been forged or interpolated by them, at that, or at any subsequent period, there can be no doubt we should have found it frequently so employed therein",Jerusalem,IL,8,Israel,Asia
"Of this design to establish what should be em¬ phatically a social religion,—a “ fellowship” or “ communion (i. e. community) of saints,” there can be, we should think, no doubt in the mind of any reflecting reader of our Sacred Books. Be¬ sides our Lord’s general promise of “ coming unto and dwelling in any man who should love Him, and keep his saying,” there is a distinct promise also of an especial presence in any assembly— even “ of two or three—gathered together in his name.” Besides the general promises made to prayer,—to the prayer of an individual “ in the closet,”—there is a distinct promise also to those who shall “ agree together, touching something they shall ask.” And it is in conformity with his own institutions that Christians have, ever since, celebrated what they designate as, emphatically, the Communion, by meeting together, “ to break bread,” in commemoration of his redemption of his people",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"And it may be added, that any one who is thus induced to give himself up implicitly to the guid¬ ance of such a Supposed infallible authority, with¬ out presuming thenceforth to exercise his own judgment on any point relative to religion, or to think for himself at all on such matters,—such a one will be likely to regard this procedure as the very perfection of pious humility,—as a most reverent observance of the rule of “ lean not to thine own understandingthough, in reality, it is the very error of leaning improperly to our own understanding. For to resolve to believe that God must have dealt with mankind just in the way that we could wish as the most desirable, and in the way that to us seems the most pro¬ bable ; this is in fact to set up ourselves as his judges. It is to dictate to Him in the spirit of Naaman, who thought that the prophet would re¬ cover him by a touch, and who chose to be healed by the waters of Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, which he deemed better than all the waters of Israel",Damascus,"IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"But it is notorious, that such was not the de¬ sign of Providence : and that no such guide does exist. Of all the persons who have claimed infal- libity, there is none who has displayed (as Paul did) “ the signs of an apostle,” that is, such palpable and undeniable miraculous powers, as to leave no doubt in any candid mind, of his being really inspired. And since the very purpose for which an infallible guide is supposed to be need¬ ed, is, the removal of all reasonable doubts, it is plain that if God had thought fit to provide us with such a guide, He would not have left it at all doubtful where we were to look for that guide","Providence, Of","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"Of course, in proportion as Christianity became less unpopular, and more generally received, this cause would less and less operate in making men reject the religion, and would be more and more likely to corrupt it. In proportion as worldly- minded men became members of the Church, they would naturally endeavour to wrest the Religion to their own views of ambition or of profit",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"For example, the prejudice of the Jews in favour of their own nation and institutions, gave rise to that very early heresy above noticed (see Acts xv., and Gal. ii.), of those who taught that all Christians were bound to keep the Mosaic Law ; or at least, that such as did so had attained a superior degree of sanctity. The violation of the UNITY [Oneness] of Christ’s religion, by thus dividing Christians into two classes, ad¬ mitted to different degrees of religious privilege, has been already noticed. The sect of Judaizing Christians, however, thus founded, seems not to have lasted long. The destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple appears to have soon put an end to it. But the general tendency towards this violation of Christian Unity, being not peculiar to the Jews, but a part of human nature, has shewn itself again and again, under various forms, in various portions of the Church","Jerusalem, Temple","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"For example, there have been in almost all Ages of the Church, persons who have taught that Jesus Christ is to come upon earth and reign in great worldly splendour at Jerusalem for a thou¬ sand years; which period is thence called Mil¬ lenium. And superior privileges, as God’s pecu¬ liar People, are then to be restored (according to this doctrine) to the Jews ; that is, to such Jews as shall have continued unbelievers ; not, to the descendants of those great multitudes of them who embraced Christianity in the days of the Apostles, and since, and who thereupon soon be¬ came blended with the Gentile Christians. But the remnant of the Jews who shall have obsti¬ nately rejected the Gospel up to that time, are then to be restored to their own land, and to have a superiority in God’s sight over men of Gentile race. And the Temple at Jerusalem is to be restored, and to be again the place of peculiar holiness, whither all men are to resort to wor¬ ship","Jerusalem, Temple, Jerusalem","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"

Of this office one principal part is, that it belongs to them (not ex¬ clusively indeed, but principally and especially) to preach the Gospel,—to instruct, exhort, ad¬ monish, and spiritually govern, Christ’s flock",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"The Virgin Mary, again, is hardly so much as named throughout the Acts1 and Apostolic Epis¬ tles. Now this silence respecting her is utterly inconceivable, supposing it had been the practice of the early Christians to pray to her. In the Gospels, again, she is but rarely mentioned",Mary,TM,8,Turkmenistan,Asia
"Even John, her adopted son, though in all likelihood he must have long outlived her, does not record her death, nor give any particulars of her life ; and yet he wrote, as is universally be¬ lieved, purposely to supply the omissions of the other Evangelists. And it is remarkable that we gather from him incidentally, and only inciden¬ tally, that Mary had usually resided with Jesus, who, at his death, committed her to the care of the beloved Disciple ; and “ from that time he took her to his home.” Why this sparing and un¬ frequent mention of her whom “ all generations should call blessed,” and who must have been personally so well known to many of the most eminent disciples 1 Humanly speaking, this seems to us impossible",Mary,TM,8,Turkmenistan,Asia

"And that this worldly policy of theirs had a principal share in the uniting of the several dis¬ tinct Christian communities into one, is plain from the circumstance that it was not Jerusalem —the earliest Christian Church, and from which all others were off-sets—but Rome, the political Capital of the Empire, that came to be regarded as the seat of government, and centre of the Uni¬ versal Church","Jerusalem, Rome","IL,US",8,"Israel,United States","Asia,North America"
"And some reformers seem to have been led by their deep detestation of the corruptions they have protested against, to endeavour to be as un¬ like as possible to the Church from which they have revolted, even in matters indifferent: alter¬ ing for the sake of change. They ought to have considered that t\iepresumption'is always against a change ; that is, since change is not a good in itself, none should be introduced unless it can be shown to be needful, and to be a change for the better.1 It is true, we may very rightly alter or reject things, good or harmless in themselves, when they are found to be very liable to abuse, or when they cause unnecessary offence. Thus “ Heze- kiah brake in pieces the brazen serpent which Moses had made,” when he found that the Israel¬ ites burned incense before it. And the Apostle Paul, though he decides that there was no harm in eating meats offered to idols, yet forbids the Corinthians to do so, when their eating it would be misapprehended and,cause offence. So, also, a statue or picture of Christ, or of any eminent Christian, is not an evil in itself. But when it is found that the vulgar pay adoration to images or pictures, or that others apprehend them to be doing so, then such images should be removed from places of worship, as being a snare to weak brethren",,IL,8,Israel,Asia

"truth of this sort first occurred, when he found that two-thirds of the rectangle, under the or¬ dinate and abscissa of a parabola, was a limit always greater than the inscribed rectilineal figure, and less than the circumscribed. In some other curves, a similar conclusion was found; and Archimedes contrived to show that it was impossible to suppose that the area of the curve could differ from the said limit, with¬ out admitting that the circumscribed figure might become less, or the inscribed figure great¬ er than the curve itself. The method of Ex¬ haustions was the name given to the indirect demonstrations thus formed. Though few things more ingenious than this method have been de¬ vised, and though nothing could be more con¬ clusive than the demonstrations resulting from it, yet it laboured under two very considerable defects. In the first place, the process by which the demonstration was obtained was long and difficult; and, in the second place, it was indi¬ rect, giving no insight into the principle on which the investigation was founded. Of con¬ sequence, it did not enable one to find out simi¬ lar demonstrations, nor increase one’s power of making more discoveries of the same kind. It was a demonstration purely synthetical, and re¬ quired, as all indirect reasoning must do, that the conclusion should be known before the rea¬ soning is begun.

He adds, that in this manuscript he had found the Indian authors often quoted; from which it appeared that algebra was known to the Indians before it was known to the Arabians. Nothing, however, of all this is to be found in the work of Diophantus, which was published about three years after the time when Bombelli wrote",,"IN,VA,GR",8,"India,Holy See (Vatican City State),Greece","Asia,N/A,Europe"
"Another advantage resulting from the use of the same notation, consists in the reduction of all the different relations among quantities to the simplest of those relations, that of equality, and the expression of it by equations. This gives a great facility of generalization, and of compar¬ ing quantities with one another. A third arises from the substitution of the arithmetical opera¬ tions of multiplication and division, for the geo¬ metrical method of the composition and resolu¬ tion of ratios. Of the first of these, the idea is so clear, and the work so simple ; of the second, the idea is comparatively so obscure, and the process so complex, that the substitution of toe former for the latter could not but be accom¬ panied with great advantage. This is, in¬ deed, what constitutes the great difference in practice between the algebraic and the geome¬ tric method of treating quantity. When the quantities are of a complex nature, so as to go beyond what in algebra is called the third power, the geometrical expression is so circuit- 562 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"The truth is, however, that the best defini¬ tion of motion can be of very little service in Physics. Epicurus defined it to be the “ change of place,” which is, no doubt, the simplest and best definition that can be given; but it must, at the same time, be confessed, that neither he, nor the moderns who have retained his defini¬ tion, have derived the least advantage from it in their subsequent researches. The properties, or, as they are called, the laws of motion, can¬ not be derived from mere definition ; they must be sought for in experience and observation, and are not to be found without a diligent compari¬ son, and scrupulous examination of facts.

The laws of Kepler are facts of the kind now treated of, and consist of three general truths, each belonging to the whole planetary system; and it was by means of them that Newton discovered the principle of gravitation. The first is, that the planets all move in elliptical orbits, having the sun for their common focus; the next, that about this focus the radius vector of each planet describes equal areas in equal times; the third and last, that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. The knowledge of each of these was the result of much research, and of the compa¬ rison of a vast multitude of observations, inso¬ much that it may be doubted if ever three truths in science were discovered at the expense of so much labour and patience, or with the exertion of more ingenuity and invention in imagining and combining observations. These discoveries were all made before Bacon wrote, but he is silent concerning them ; for the want of mathe¬ matical knowledge concealed from his view some of the most splendid and interesting parts of science",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"The facts of this class, however, unless the analogy be very close, are apt to mislead, by re¬ presenting accidental regularity as if it were constant. Of this we have an example in the supposed analogy between the colours in the prismatic spectrum and the divisions of the mo¬ nochord. The colours in the prismatic spectrum do not occupy the same proportion of it in all cases; the analogy depends on the particular kind of glass, not on any thing that is common to all refraction.

"Instead of proceeding upward from the effect to the cause, he proceeded continually downward from the cause to the effect. It was in this man¬ ner that he sought to determine the laws of mo¬ tion, and of the collision of bodies, in which last all his conclusions were erroneous. From the same source he deduced the existence of a ple¬ num^ and the continual preservation of the same quantity of motion in the universe; a proposi¬ tion which, in a certain sense, is true, but in the sense in which he understood it, is altogether false. Reasonings of the kind which he em¬ ployed may possibly suit, as Bacon observed, with intelligences of a higher order than man, but to his case they are quite inapplicable.

It is by following his reasonings, and by pursuing the train of his thoughts in his own elegant, though somewhat diffuse exposition of them, that we become acquainted with the fer¬ tility of his genius, with the sagacity, penetra¬ tion, and comprehensiveness of his mind. The service which he rendered to real knowledge is to be estimated, not only from the truths which he discovered, but from the errors which he de¬ tected,—not merely from the sound principles which he established, but from the pernicious idols which he overthrew. His acuteness was strongly displayed in the address with which he exposed the errors of his adversaries, and refuted their opinions, by comparing one part of them with another, and proving their extreme incon¬ sistency.

"Of those who cultivated astronomy, many were infected by this weakness, though some were completely superior to it. Alphonso, the King of Castile, was among the latter. He flourished about the middle of the thirteenth century, and was remarkable for such freedom of thought, and such boldness of language, as it required his royal dignity to protect. He ap¬ plied himself diligently to the study of astrono¬ my ; he perceived the inaccuracy of Ptolemy’s tables, and endeavoured to correct their errors by new tables of his own.

"An interval of nearly a thousand years divid¬ ed Ptolemy from Alhazen, who, in the history of optical discovery, appears as his immediate successor. This ingenious Arabian lived in the eleventh century, and his merit can be more fairly, and will be more highly appreciated, now that the work of his predecessor has become known. The merit of his book on Optics was al¬ ways admitted; but he was supposed to have bor¬ rowed much from Ptolemy, without acknowledg¬ ing it; and the prejudices entertained in favour of a Greek author, especially of one who had been for so many years a legislator in science, gave a false impression, both of the genius and the integrity of his modern rival. The work of Al¬ hazen is, nevertheless, in many respects, supe¬ rior to that of Ptolemy, and in nothing more than in the geometry which it employs. The problem known by his name, to find the point in a spherical speculum, at which a ray coming from one given point shall be reflected to ano¬ ther given point, is very well resolved in his book, though a problem of so much difficulty, that Montucla hazards the opinion, that no Ara¬ bian geometer was ever equal to the solution of it.4 It is now certain, however, that the solu¬ tion, from whatever quarter it came, was not borrowed from Ptolemy, in whose work no men¬ tion is made of any such question; and it may very well be doubted, whether, had this problem 1 Aristophanis Nubes, v. 766. edit.

"Of the new or infinitesimal analysis, we are, therefore, to consider Newton as the first inventor, Leibnitz as the second; his disco¬ very, though posterior in time, having heen made independently of the other, and having no less claim to originality. It had the advantage also of being first made known to the world; an account of it, and of its peculiar algorithm, having been inserted in the first volume of the ylcta Eniditorim, in 1684. Thus, while New¬ ton’s discovery remained a secret, communicated only to a few friends, the geometry of Leibnitz was spreading with great rapidity over the Con¬ tinent. Two most able coadjutors, the brothers James and John Bernoulli, joined their talents to those of the original inventor, and illustrated the new methods by the solution of a great Ara- riety of difficult and interesting problems. The reserve of Newton still kept his countrymen ig¬ norant of his geometrical discoveries; and the first book that appeared in England on the new geometry was that of Craig, who professedly derived his knowledge from the writings of Leibnitz and his friends. Nothing, however, like rivalship or hostility between these inventors had yet appeared; each seemed willing to admit the originality of the other’s discoveries; and Newton, in the passage of the Principia just re¬ ferred to, gave a highly favourable opinion on the subject of the discoveries of Leibnitz","Of, Newton, Newton, Newton","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"Of the works that appeared in the early stages of the calculus, none is more entitled to notice than the Flarmonia Mensurarum of Cotes. The idea of reducing the areas of curves to those of the circle and hyperbola, in those cases which did not admit of an accurate comparison with rectilineal spaces, had early occurred to Newton, and was very fully exemplified in his Quadra¬ ture of Curves. Cotes extended this method:— his work appeared in 1722, and gave the rules for finding the fluents of fractional expressions, whether rational or irrational, greatly general¬ ized and highly improved by means of a pro¬ perty of the circle discovered by himself, and justly reckoned among the most remarkable pro¬ positions in geometry. It is singular that a work so profound and so useful as the Flarmo¬ nia Mensurarum should never have acquired, even among the mathematicians of England, the popularity which it deserves; and that, on the Continent, it should be very little known, even after the excellent commentary and additions of Bishop Walmesley. The reasons perhaps are, that, in many parts, the work is obscure; that it does not explain the analysis which must have led to the formula contained in the tables; and 1 Newton’s Fluxions, Colson’s Translation, p. 116, sect. 107","Of, Newton, Newton","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"The theory from which the explanation we speak of is deduced is, that light is an emana¬ tion of particles, moving in straight lines with incredible velocity, and attracted by the particles of transparent bodies. When, therefore, light falls obliquely on the surface of such a body, its motion may be resolved into two, one parallel to that surface, and the other perpendicular to it. Of these, the first is not affected by the at¬ traction of the body, which is perpendicular to its own surface; and, therefore, it remains the same in the refracted that it was in the incident ray. But the velocity perpendicular to the sur¬ face is increased by the attraction of the body, and, according to the principles of dynamics, (the 39th, book i. Princip.) whatever be the quantity of this velocity, its square, on entering the same transparent body, will always he aug¬ mented by the same quantity. But it is easy to demonstrate that, if there be two right-angled triangles, with a side in the one equal to a side in the other, the hypotheneuse of the first being given, and the squares of their remaining sides differing by a given space, the sines of the angles opposite to the equal sides must have a given 4 P 666 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

"701 remarkable propositions, derived from sources beyond the usual scope of Geometry, are yet as¬ similated with that science. Of such accessions, one of the most beautiful is the late curious and unexpected discovery of Gauss, that, besides the ordinary regular polygons, a numerous class more complex, including the next polygon of seventeen sides, are capable of being inscribed within a circle, by a mere geometrical construc¬ tion. 1 In solving the common problems, the straight line and the circle are generally combined, which requires the application of both the ruler and the compasses. Schooten effected by the ruler alone several simple constructions, of use parti¬ cularly in castrametation. But the late Masche- roni2 of Bergamo, in a small work which appear¬ ed in 1795, made a beautiful addition to Ele¬ mentary Geometry, by the solution of a variety of problems, especially those concerning the in¬ scription of the regular polygons, with the help exclusively of compasses.

"703 The Romans, who cared only about objects of vulgar ambition, overlooked the refined mode of Greek Notation, and remained satisfied with their own very clumsy and involved system, which could with difficulty represent a large number, but was absolutely disqualified for serving in any way the purposes of calculation. They were obliged therefore to have recourse to counters, and by help of the Abacus, or decimal board, they performed the ordinary operations of summing accounts. This humble expedient was practised in Europe till the seventeenth century, and is still used by the traders throughout the Chinese Empire, its application being there facilitated by the prevalence of the decimal subdivision of weights, measures, and coins",,CN,8,China,Asia
"The discovery of the Denary Notation, so beau¬ tiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to India, though neither the place nor the date of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic nu¬ merals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathe¬ maticians are now found, from examination of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new sys¬ tem ot notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in Spain, whence it was slow¬ ly communicated to the several Christian States over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs com¬ piled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly pur¬ chased by the various monasteries and convents throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transac¬ tions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of sexagesimals. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the prac¬ tice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regio¬ montanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly em¬ ployed. To count downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards.

"Of this fine theory, the first trace was shown by the rapid genius of Leibnitz, in his mode of dif¬ ferentiating a curve whose equation itself is sup¬ posed to undergo the minutest alteration. The controversies of the Bernoullis concerning Isope¬ rimeters and Lines of the Swiftest Descent, aug¬ mented greatly the various resources of that kind of Analysis. But Euler, combining their dis¬ coveries, produced a new and direct mode of find¬ ing such Maxima and Minima, and compressed the solutions into a systematic form, in a distinct treatise published at Lausanne in 1744. This elaborate performance led the way for the simp¬ ler and most elegant and comprehensive doctrine created by the early genius of Lagrange, and invested by him with a commodious notation; Euler, who was far superior to any feeling oi jealousy, readily embraced this improvement, and bestowed on it the denomination of the Cal¬ culus of Variations, of which he explained the principles and application, after the most com¬ plete manner, in a tract appended to the third volume of his great work. The distinction be¬ tween Differentials and Variations is rather subtle, yet may be easily conceived by consid¬ ering the nature of the Parabola. When an ordinate shifts into a proximate position, both it and the corresponding absciss acquire Differ¬ entials ; but if the Parameter suffer the minut¬ est alteration, the whole trace of the curve will vary, and the infinitesimal mutation which the ordinate thence undergoes is termed its Varia¬ tion. The algorithm adopted to denote Varia¬ tions consists of the Greek letters instead of the Roman or Italic, which have been appropriated to the ordinary Differentials.

"The method of Analytical or Derivative Func¬ tions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work ; the same subject having been Heated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor’s theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But La¬ grange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of Infinitesimals or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubt¬ ed whether, with all his ingenuity, he has at¬ tained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calcu¬ lation, would almost spontaneously regard a pro¬ cess of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument.

Having completed the usual course of education, and turned his thoughts in 1693 to the medical profession, he took a degree in j)hysic. He now travelled into France, and spent some time at the country-seat of the Marquis de I’Hopital, whom he taught the New Calculus. Proceeding next to Holland, he was appointed in 1695 Professor of Medicine and Mathematics (for these sciences were strangely conjoined) in the University of Groningen. The fame he there acquired by his lectures and writings appears to have awakened the jealousy or bigotry of the Calvinistic clergy, who brought a serious charge against him, for impugning the doctrine of the resurrection in a Thesis maintained by one of his scholars, and composed or corrected bv himself, which represented the body as in a state of continual mutation, not only the liquid, but even the solid parts being successively absorbed and renewed, and no particle of the composition remaining after a very short term of years.

"But such enormous cold exceeded the bounds of credibility, and iEpinus soon discovered the source of this illusion. Employing tubes of a wider bore, he observed the quicksilver, drawing afterit a concave surface, to retreat as it congealed, and sink into the rest of the liquid mass. The semi-metal must therefore have suffered a large contraction in the act of freezing, and become much denser. Yet twenty years elapsed before the point of mercurial congelation was correctly ascertained. On the 16th of January 1780, Von Elterlein of Vytegra, a town of Northern Rus¬ sia, in the latitude of 61°, found that some pure quicksilver exposed in a porcelain tea-cup during the night had become solid, but began to melt again when the thermometer rose to 40 degrees below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale.

That contraction is undoubtedly caused by the ex¬ pulsion of a part of the water held so obstinate¬ ly by the clay, the repulsive force excited by the accession of heat controlling the adhesion of the moisture. It may be inferred that the clay attracts the remains of latent humidity with a force always increasing; but the repulsion in¬ fused by the conversion of the expelled particles into steam ascends nearly in a geometrical pro¬ gression with equal accessions of heat.

"Dynamics could hardly be said to exist as a science without the invention of Fluxions as a language by which its conditions and results might be expressed; and from that time onwards, the necessities of the natural philosopher have been the prime sources of inspiration to the geometer, while the subjects have become so blended that a mere discoverer in mathe¬ matics has become a singularity. It would be hardly possible to point out any mathematician of the highest class since Newton, or but a few of the second class, who have not contributed almost as much to physical science as they have to analysis. Of purely mathematical discoveries, the great majority have been called forth by the immediate necessity arising from some problem requiring solution in astronomy, mechanics, optics, or heat. Lagrange’s method of Variations of arbitrary Constants in Integration, the artifices for the computation of attractions by Laplace’s coefficients ; the introduction of the method of fac¬ torials by Kramp in his solution of the problem of refraction, and numberless improvements in the Theory of Definite Integrals by Fourier and his suc¬ cessors, sufficiently warrant the statement, and show how richly the physical sciences have repaid to the purely mathematical ones the debt which they oi'igi- nally owed. One other conclusion may be drawn from these and parallel facts. It is that the com¬ binations arising out of external phenomena are more suggestive of the possible relations of number and quantity than is the most unlimited stretch of fancy and imagination; and I believe it will be conceded that, with few exceptions, theorems of the greatest value and beauty have been more frequently dis¬ covered during the attempt to solve some physical or at least geometrical problem, than in compre¬ hensive yet indefinite attempts to generalize the re¬ lations of abstract magnitude","Newton, Of, Laplace","US,TR",8,"United States,Turkey","North America,Asia"
"The national pride of England in the triumphs of Newton impelled her ablest mathematicians to at¬ tempt to carry forward the synthetic methods which he had chiefly used, at least in his published works, to the more arduous and intricate questions of Me¬ chanics and Astronomy which presented themselves for solution in the course of the 18th century. Mac- laurin was almost the last Englishman of that period whose mathematical writings came into direct com¬ petition with the rising schools of Germany and France. The labours of Matthew Stewart, and Simpson were mostly geometrical; those of Landen and Waring, though profound, created little general impression; and, gradually, the extent and difficulty of the foreign mathematics, increased by the use of the Leibnitzian notation of differentials which was ab¬ solutely unfamiliar in England, deterred almost every one even from perusing the writings of Clairaut and D’Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace. Of the conti¬ nental mathematicians, Euler was probably the best known, owing to the lucidity of his writings and their eminently practical tendencies. Some idea may be formed of the negation of mathematical talent in Britain during the later portion of the last century, when we find D’Alembert declaring, in 1769, that if an Englishman is to be elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences, he will vote for Earl Stanhope as the best mathemati¬ cian there, as he believes, not having read any of his works ! If the choice was to be free, he should prefer M. de Lagrange !

"I learn from good authority that he obtained a place for the unseen planet not very different from that which he finally adopted. Early in 1844 he ob¬ tained from Greenwich the valuable series of places of Uranus which were afterwards in like manner ap¬ plied for by M. Leverrier. In September 1845, he communicated to Professor Challis the elements of the new planet’s orbit (neglecting the inclination) and an ephemeris of its geocentric place; and in October he transmitted the elements alsotothe Astronomer Royal. Mr Adams This, it will be observed, was soon after M. Leverrier’s preceded attention was first directed to the subject, and nine r/r months previous to his announcement of the locality similar in- where the new body should be sought. Mr Adams yestiga- afterwards repeated his calculation with a mean dis-tlon ’ tance ^gth less than before, and considered himself warranted, by the improvement thus produced on the residual errors, in inferring that a farther consider¬ able diminution of the mean distance would satisfy the observations still better. This was communicated to Mr Airy on the 2d September 1846 ; subsequently therefore to the publication of M. Leverrier’s Ele¬ ments. Mr Adams, in communicating his results (at a later time) to the Astronomical Society, with charac¬ teristic modesty says, “ I mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of M. Leverrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honors of the discovery, lor there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr Galle.” And such is no doubt the fact. The priority of Mr (1^0-) Adams m the mathematical investigation is as certain net was not as that the researches of M. Leverrier alone produced discovered the discovery of Neptune. Even the search for the in conse- planet which took place in August and September (lueI1Ce• 1846 at Cambridge by Professor Challis, was not oc¬ casioned by Mr Adams’ researches only ; it was the near coincidence of the longitude assigned by Mr Adams in the previous October with that published by M. Leverrier in June 1846 which induced Mr Airy to suggest this investigation of the heavens, and to oiler (if need were) himself to bear the ex¬ pense. Had the planet been discovered1 at Cambridge The planet was indeed seen at Cambridge by Mr Challis, for it was recorded more than once amongst the numerous fixed sars whose places were taken down in the progress of the search; but as the comparisons of the “ sweeus” were not made at the time, the discovery was anticipated by M.

Me¬ chain was apparently wayward and impracticable, somewhat too aged for so great a work, yet a really good astronomer. The want of agreement to within 3"" of two sets of observations for latitude atBarcelona, the southern end of the arc at that time, led him to the suppression of one of them, and he was tormented ever after by the consciousness of the evasion, which deprived him of the tranquillity necessary to resume and complete his work, which was done chiefly by Delambre after vexatious delays.1 The error, which may be said to have cost Mechain his life, was pro¬ bably owing to the instrument employed on this sur¬ vey, the repeating circle of Borda, only fourteen inches diameter, with a rather weak telescope. The opinion generally entertained in Britain is, that the repeating circle was quite inadequate to the prodi¬ gious accuracy required of it, especially in the deter¬ mination of latitudes. The errors of mere division are often trivial compared to those inherent in other parts of an instrument. Of these a deficiency of op¬ tical power, and the want of absolute security of the clamps, upon which the entire success of the princi¬ ple of repetition depends, are amongst the most ob¬ vious. The arc was finally prolonged from Barcelona to Formentera by Biot and Arago in 1806. The conclusion of the survey was not destitute of the ad¬ venturous character of its commencement.

In the case of observations so exceedingly delicate as those of the planets, the astronomer has to keep up an incessant struggle between the anxiety to record all that he sees, and that of recording nothing more than he really and perfectly sees. One or two glimpses are not sufficient. Herschel at one time imagined that the new planet had one or more rings which unquestionably do not exist. His elaborate in¬ vestigation of the figure, belts, and rings of Saturn, the incredible tenuity of the 1 after, and the fact of their ro¬ tation in 10h 32m, were amongst the most interesting of his observations, and were illustrated by drawings made with remarkable care.

"Some regions of the sky abound more with them than others. The Milky Way presents to the naked eye a nebulous appearance extending over large tracts, and nebulae more or less dense are frequent within and near its borders. These facts were well known from an early period. Some conspicuous nebulae were described in the sixteenth century; that in Andro¬ meda by Marius and the conspicuous nebula in Orion by Huygens. Halley added several, but the first descriptive catalogue of these objects was pub¬ lished by Messier in 1783 (in the Connaissance des Terns), and it forms the basis of the modern obser¬ vations",Orion,PH,8,Philippines,Asia
"jS. Wholly irregular, as the nebula of Orion, the Magellanic clouds, &c",Orion,PH,8,Philippines,Asia
"If, on the other hand, the nebulous appearance be due to a diffusion of starry matter, the distance may be that of any order of fixed stars ; and this opinion derives weight from the evident connection of some nebulse with stars round which they seem to cluster or hang almost like a drapery. Thus in 1811 he supposed that the nebula in Orion need not be more distant than a star of the 7th or 8th magnitude",Orion,PH,8,Philippines,Asia
"The 'proofs on which the whole of this cosmogony rests are, l.s£, the gradation of appearances above described, to be collected from distinct objects in the heavens; and, Zdly, supposed changes observed by him in the nebula of Orion and others, during thirty years, and even during intervals of a few years. As to the last argument, it is admitted, we believe, by the best authorities, to be without weight. The changes of aspect of such curiously faint and graduated ob¬ jects, even to the same eye using the same telescope, are numberless, and may be due to the slightest at¬ mospheric and physiological influences.

Some German astronomers of eminence have indeed tried to deduce from an assumed distribution of the stars in the Milky Way, the necessity of allowing that space is not per¬ fectly transparent, and have even attempted to assign the law of extinction of light through the sidereal in¬ tervals ; but having examined their reasoning with the best care I have been able to give it, I am bound to say that it appears to me very far short of conclusive.3 IV. Of the Motion of our System in Space.—That (209.) the stars are not fixed, but have “ proper motions,” Proper mo- not explicable by the gyrations of our earth round its tlons of centre of gravity (which produce precession and nuta- naiiey tion), nor by its revolution round the sun (on which aberration and parallax depend), was a fact first de¬ tected by Halley from a comparison of ancient and modern observations. Though small in amount, yet as it continually increases in the same direction, this Proper Motion becomes in the course of ages an im¬ portant quantity. In 2000 years, Arcturus, ^ Cas- siopeise and 61 Cygni have moved 2 J, 3 J, and 6 times the moon’s diameter",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"Of the subsequent labours of Bessel we must speak ' very shortly. The determination of the parallax of the star called 61 Cygni, perhaps the most original and important of these, we shall refer to another sec¬ tion, where we shall compare it with the results ob¬ tained by other astronomers. He made interesting physical observations on Halley’s comet at its return in 1835; he prepared the materials for a very ex¬ tended catalogue of fixed stars, arranged in zones, more recently published by Professor Weisse. In connection with the theory of the pendulum as a measure of gravity, he repeated and extended Newton’s important experiments on the uniformity of the gra¬ vitating force on all kinds of matter ; he applied a new correction to the vibrations of the pendulum, and improved the method of observing them correctly; and he discussed with his habitual mathematical skill and elaborate perseverance the figure of the Earth, from the whole of the then existing' observations; whilst he also directed an operation for connecting the Russian triangulations with those of western Europe,—a delicate task, which he performed with consummate skill. It will thus be seen that (without mentioning a host of minor works and memoirs) there was hardly a great department of Astronomy in which Bessel did not take a distinguished part.

"(274.) Yet, if not true, the cardinal fact remains unex¬ plained. The anomalous phenomena of the Tails of Comets, considered by Herschel to be altogether inex¬ plicable by the law of gravity, demand the closest scrutiny ; and one can hardly help supposing that the two difficulties may be in close connection. As the Newtonian law is now considered (since the dis¬ covery of Neptune, and the latest corrections of the Lunar Tables) to be absolutely sufficient to account for everything connected with planetary motion, the Astronomy of Comets will be looked to with increas¬ ing interest, as likely to reveal some laws of nature not otherwise to be detected.

"(324.) In the Cornish engine we see the Energy of Heat Their per- ren(jereq available to an extent which the inventor fection. .. , himselt would at one time have thought scarcely cre¬ dible. The combustion of a bushel of coal which in a Newcomen’s engine improved by Smeaton was capable of raising 3,000,000 pounds through one foot, in Watt’s improved pumping engine raised 20,000,000 pounds the same height. But by the indefatigable skill and perseverance of engineers the Cornish pumps now yield at least five times the last amount. This, however, is not the place to enter upon these details, nor can we stop to particularize the other and various mechanical inventions intro¬ duced by Watt in the form of valves, governors, and steam-indicators. Still less can we enlarge upon the endless and still multiplying applications of this ad¬ mirable moving power, which is as capable of super¬ seding the greatest natural forces hitherto applied by man to the useful arts, as it is adapted by its easy regulation to replace human industry in the most delicate operations; “ the trunk of an elephant, which can pick up a pin or rend an oak, is as nothing to it.”2 Of the applications of the steam-engine with which (325.) Mr Watt was less immediately connected, its adap- tation to locomotion in the case of ships in the last steam to century, and in that of railway trains in the present, navigation, have been the most striking, and fraught with con¬ sequences the most important to mankind. Of the latter we shall have occasion to speak in a future section ; of the origin of steam navigation we may here say a very few words. Passing over projects which never were realized, of moving barges by steam, or other inanimate power, against wind and tide,— such as those of Worcester, Papin, and Hulls,—wre find that the first experiment entitled to be called successful was made by Mr Miller of Dalswinton in Miller— Scotland, conjointly -with Mr James Taylor, tutor in Taylor- his family, who together formed the project of mov¬ ing vessels by means of paddle-wheels driven by a steam-engine, and realized it with the aid of Sym¬ ington, a practical engineer. As we shall also find in the case of steam-carriages, the idea of the applica¬ tion of the steam-engine to move ships was already a familiar one to the minds of many persons about the middle of the last century. To put it in practice with advantage was the step required. Mr Miller’s first boat was launched on Dalswinton Loch in Dum¬ friesshire, in October 1788, and attained a speed of five miles an hour. The subject was pursued by Symington and others. In 1789 a larger vessel was propelled on the Forth and Clyde Canal. Subse¬ quently, however, the invention languished. The want of co-operation, of capital, and ingenuity, na¬ turally extinguishes many valuable inventions. Watt himself was only rescued from the same difficulty by the unusual intelligence of Boulton and Small, his coadjutors at Birmingham. Symington was less for¬ tunate, as well as probably less meritorious ; and though it is well established that Fulton, who passes on the other side of the Atlantic for the inventor of steam-ships, had seen the relics of Symington’s second experiment, we must do the Americans the justice to say that the application of steam to navigation first flourished in the United States. In 1807 Fulton Fulton, started a river boat with an engine of Boulton and Watt. In 1813 the example was tardily imitated on the Firth of Clyde. The subsequent improvements need not here be specified. They have been very great and striking, but with the exception of the recent substitution of the screw-propeller for paddle-wheels, they scarcely involve any new principles.3 We may briefly close what we have to say of Mr (326.) Watt personally. His health was feeble from child- ^ar°eter hood, but being blessed with much calmness of tern- 0f Watt, per he prolonged his life to a great age, and passed through its struggles, though they were to him con- 1 The double-acting engine was planned in 1774 or 1775.

Those who recollect the vivacity and bright intelligence of even his later years, will understand that in his more active days it must have been diffi¬ cult to refuse Brunei at least a hearing.

Not only is it possible to execute in a comparatively short time, and with a prodigious economy, objects such as blocks and pulleys, which are required in vast num¬ bers and precisely alike, but the nicety and accuracy of the manufacture is thereby increased, and owing to the facility with which inanimate force may be concentrated on machinery, works which transcend the power of unaided muscular labour are as surely and exactly executed as those of smaller dimensions",,BN,8,Brunei Darussalam,Asia

The block-machinery at Portsmouth consists of a The block- series of engines impelled by steam, and by means of machinery; which the materials of wood and metal employed in the construction of ships’blocks are reduced to exact forms in graduated sizes, and are finally put together with very little manual labour. These machines, with the exception of the turning-lathe and circular saw, were wholly new, and, it is stated, were devised in part by General Bentham, who gave to Brunei at least the benefit of his advice and previous experiments. In some of them we have the first germ of implements now used by every machine-maker in the kingdom; and the ingenuity of the movements, and the variety of effects produced, earned for this great invention a just celebrity. Such a beginning could not have been made without the aid of government. To con¬ struct the tools was an expensive and troublesome business, and to start the manufactory cost L.53,000, which was speedily saved by the economy of the pro- its results, cess.

"The more we reflect on the comparative state of the arts now and a century ago, the more we shall find reason to estimate highly the introduction of correct and scientific ideas of machinery and of tools for con¬ structing other machines and structures. It was, in fact, the necessary complement of the invention of the steam-engine. Watt contrived the mighty Heart which was to give a new impulse to social life, Bru¬ nei and others of the same stamp added limbs and muscles, whereby its energies were rendered tho¬ roughly practical. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth centuries, had given to the world designs for countless mechanical contrivances, often highly original anti ingenious. But many were grounded on fallacies, and others belong to the class of elaborate trifles. At that period the slide-rest of the turning-lathe, the planing machine, and the circular saw, were practically unknown; at least the two former, which are incomparably the most important inventions of their class, and which belong to no certain author, having almost imper¬ ceptibly come into use—the slide-rest about the Slide-rest end of the last century, the planing machine as f1111 Plan' lately as about 1820. The former of these readily ^?n™a' forms surfaces of revolution with geometrical accu¬ racy, the latter plane surfaces, and in either case the application to metals is most important. The circular saw and slide-rest form part of Brunei’s series of machines, and he afterwards constructed the former on a very great scale for the manufacture of wooden veneers. To them he added the mortising machine, and these, it will be seen (together with the planing engine), form the staple of the magnificent and varied apparatus with which, driven by the gi¬ gantic power of steam, our mechanical factories are now so generally provided. We again repeat that the triumphs of art in which our generation glories, our railroads, our locomotives, our crystal palaces, and our steam navies, would have been impossible feats but for the improvement of tools and the substi¬ tution of steam for muscular power",,BN,8,Brunei Darussalam,Asia

It will endure like the cloacee of regal Rome, when the palace and the cathedral have crumbled to dust. Yet here also we perceive that it was Brunei’s exquisite mechanical tact and inge¬ nuity which enabled him to succeed. The problem of the tunnel is not one of balancing vaults; the sta¬ tical conditions of stability are simple enough, and it was not in the solution of such that Brunei pecu¬ liarly excelled. The practical problem was to intro¬ duce a rigid tube of brick horizontally into the middle of a quaking mass of mud ; and the solution was the invention of a tool which should enable men to make the excavation and to proceed with the building in safety.

"It is only when these partial impressions concur that they are strong enough to affect the sense of vision; (2), the representation of the phenomenon of double refraction by a wave of two sheets, or the simultaneous propagation of spherical and spheroidal waves in one and the same medium. Of the last of these doctrines I shall speak in the next section in connection with the discoveries of Malus. With re¬ spect to the former I may here observe that it gives the only satisfactory explanation of the primary diffi¬ culty of the undulatory hypothesis,—namely, that a beam of light admitted by a hole in a screen pursues a rectilinear course afterwards, instead of spreading sideways, as do waves in water, and waves of sound",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia
"The partial reflection which always accompanies re¬ fraction is strongly and justly insisted on as an ob¬ vious consequence of the theory, while it requires a sepai'ate hypothesis on Newton’s. But the chief weight is claimed for the evidence from the colours of heated surfaces, of thin plates, and of diffracted shadows, all of which the author explains by the mixture of two portions of light conveying to the same particle of ether at the same time either ac¬ cordant or opposing motions, thus redoubling or destroying the light. Of these the splendid iri¬ descent colours reflected by surfaces having fine equidistant lines drawn upon them, admit of the most elementary and striking explanation. The reflected image of a luminous point viewed in a mirror thus cut up by parallel lines, consists of one common reflection and numerous lateral images which are coloured, and in which the angles of inci¬ dence and reflection are not equal, thus contradicting one of the axioms of common optics. Young showed that the scattered waves of light recover the faculty of appearing when the surface of the plate is seen under such an angle that foreshortened intervals between the scratches amount severally to the length of one undulation or a multiple of it; for then the waves of light scattered by the reflecting surface will not come entire to the eye, but each will have a part systema¬ tically suppressed by the non-reflecting space of the groove, so that the remainders being nearly in one phase, concur in making a general impression. This experiment, therefore, literally presents us with the paradox that by suppressing half the light, the re¬ mainder is not suffered to be extinguished by it. The different colours appear reflected at different angles, because the obliquity must vary in order to be ac¬ commodated to their several wave-lengths, and each colour undergoes several repetitions corresponding to breadths representing the successive multiples of a wave-length","Newton, Of, Young","US,TR,UY",8,"United States,Turkey,Uruguay","North America,Asia,South America"

But his subject by predi¬ lection was optics, and here he made his most con¬ siderable discovery, and that which he has followed out with most minute industry, namely, the rotatory action of fluids, in which he had Seebeck for a co-dis¬ coverer.

He studied the colours of crystallized plates with exemplary patience, and as we have seen in the preceding section, by his accu¬ rate observations on the law of the tints, prepared the way for the theory of transverse vibrations ; but his owrn doctrine of moveable polarization, which he imagined to explain them, made no impression on the progress of science. He was the first who di¬ vided doubly-refracting crystals into positive (as quartz), and negative (as calcareous spar).

"927 the volumes or the weights of those ingredients were equal. “ Quicksilver, whether it were applied hot to cold water or cold to hot water, never produced more effect in heating or cooling an equal measure of the water than would have been produced by water equally hot or cold with the quicksilver, and only two-thirds of its bulk.” Of course, Avhen equal weights were used, the inequality of effect was still more striking, for, from the great density of quick¬ silver, it required no less than 30 times the weight of the -water mixed with it in order that it should con¬ tribute in an equal degree to the production of a mean temperature. Strange to say, the interpreta¬ tion of this important experiment remained to be made by Dr Black after half a century. He taught that temperature is an effect of heat, which is neither the same in all bodies nor in the same body under differing circumstances; that the superior effect of the water to the mercury in determining the tempe¬ rature of the mixture was caused by the fact, that it is the nature of quicksilver to require a smaller amount of heat to raise its temperature through one degree than an equal volume or weight of water would require under like conditions. Black made many experiments to satisfy himself of the constancy of this property in bodies; and with the assistance of Irvine,1 probably ascertained its nume¬ rical value (the amount of heat necessary to raise an unit of mass of -water through one degree of tempe¬ rature being the standard) in different cases ; but he left the subject chiefly in the hands of that observer and of Watt. The former gave the name of ca¬ pacity for heat to this property, which was after- wards more happily termed specific heat by Gadolin, who made many experiments on the subject, as did also Cavendish and Adair Crawford whose theory of animal heat, published in 1778, turns entirely on this property of bodies","Of, Irvine","TR,US",8,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"

"Educated in a manner somewhat irregular, and with only the ordinary advantages of a remote country town, his talents appeared in the earnestness with which he cultivated at once the most various branches of know¬ ledge and speculation. He was fond of metaphysics; he was fond of experiment; he was an ardent student of nature ; and he possessed at an early age poetic powers, which, had they been cultivated, would, in the opinion of competent judges, have made him as emi¬ nent in literature as he became in science. All these tastes endured throughout life. Business could not stifle them,—even the approach of death was un¬ able to extinguish them. The reveries of his boy¬ hood on the sea-worn cliffs of Mount’s Bay, may yet be traced in many of the pages dictated during the last year of his life amidst the ruins of the Coli¬ seum. But the physical sciences—those more em¬ phatically called at that time chemical—speedily attracted and absorbed his most earnest attention",Bay,PH,8,Philippines,Asia

"(801.) Whilst Ampere, Arago, Davy, the two De la Seebeck. Rivegj and Mr Faraday, were throwing light on ofthermo- the causes, and developing the consequences of electricity. Oersted’s experiment, Seebeck of Berlin discovered in 1822 a new source of electric excitement, which has since become indirectly of very great im¬ portance. This was Thermo-Electricity. He found that when heterogeneous metals are united, either by soldering or pressure, and the junction heated, a current of electricity is established. The order of metals which produces the most energetic combina¬ tions, is wholly unlike the arrangement of the vol¬ taic series, and has no apparent reference to any other known property of those substances. Bismuth and antimony stand at the opposite extremities of the scale, and a pair formed of them is consequently the most powerful which can be made. When heat¬ ed at the junction, positive electricity passes from bismuth to antimony. In 1823, Oersted, then on a visit to Paris, united with Fourier in making expex-iments on this subject, and was probably the first who constructed thermo-electrical piles. Un¬ questionably, the most important application of these was to the construction of an instrument for measur¬ ing the effects of radiant heat, by Nobili and Melloni, of which an account has already been given, Art","Paris, Un","US,IN",8,"United States,India","North America,Asia"
"Amongst Dr Faraday’s contributions to science (837.) not connected with electricity, the most remarkable Dr Fara- perhaps is the condensation of many gases into the ^ 1^“e’ liquid form by cold and pressure, of which he is the tain gases, undoubted discoverer. This fact is highly interest¬ ing both in a scientific and practical point of view. In the latter it was early applied by the late ingenious Sir M. I. Brunei as a new moving power (375), and it may not improbably yet be resorted to for that purpose. The subsequent discovery of a mode of solidifying carbonic acid by M. Thilorier is not only interesting in itself, but affords a method of produc¬ ing more intense cold for experimental purposes than any other previously known",,BN,8,Brunei Darussalam,Asia

"2 I ought to mention that the practical introduction of the electric telegraph in England is in no small degree due to the energy of Mr Fothergill Cooke, joint patentee with Mr Wheatstone for the invention. The question of the respective shares of these gentlemen in the merit of telegraphic communication was submitted, in 1841, to the arbitration of Sir Marc Brunei and the late Mr Daniell, the result of which appears to leave the preponderance of merit in some respects ambiguous ; neverthe¬ less, in a history of Science, Mr Wheatstone is clearly entitled to the pre-eminent place. Several pamphlets have also been sub¬ sequently published by the parties. It is significant that Mr Cooke admits having borrowed his idea from becoming acquainted, at Heidelberg, in March 1836, with Gauss’s experiments","Heidelberg, March","BN,ZA,GB",8,"Brunei Darussalam,South Africa,United Kingdom","Asia,Africa,Europe"
"III. Of electro-magnetism used as a moving power, we need say little. No one can witness the astonishing experiment of the sudden creation of magnetic power sufficient to sustain one or two tons by the voltaic dissolution of a few grains of zinc, without having the idea suggested of a continuous moving force. This enormous power is, however, exerted through a space so excessively minute, that its dynamical effect is always small; and, though it is, of course, possible to produce an engine by a sufficiently gigantic arrangement, the success has hitherto not been encouraging",Of,TR,8,Turkey,Asia

"2 M. Arago gives, no doubt, an erroneous impression in stating that the westerly movement of the line of No Declination has carried it in 200 years from Paris to Philadelphia. Yet I cannot subscribe to the opinion of his able commentator that the Loop of No Declination which passed over Europe in the seventeenth century moved eastwards, and may still be traced in Asia —(British Association, Fifth Report, p. 63; Arago’s Meteorological Essays, translated, p. 330).
