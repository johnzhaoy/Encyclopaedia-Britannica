"The dialogue of our illustrious countryman Buchanan, De Jure Regni apud Scotos, though occasionally disfigured by the keen and indig¬ nant temper of the writer, and by a predilection (pardonable in a scholar warm from the schools of ancient Greece and Rome) for forms of policy unsuitable to the circumstances of modern Europe, bears, nevertheless, in its general spirit, a closer resemblance to the political philosophy of the eighteenth century, than any composition which had previously appeared. The ethical paradoxes afterwards inculcated by Hobbes as the ground-work of his slavish theory of govern¬ ment, are anticipated and refuted, and a power¬ ful argument is urged against that doctrine of Utility which has attracted so much notice in our times. The political reflections, too, inci¬ dentally introduced by the same author in his History of Scotland, bear marks of a mind worthy of a better age than fell to his lot. Of this kind are the remarks with which he closes his narrative of the wanton cruelties exercised in punishing the murderers of James the First","Buchanan, Rome, Of","GR,LR,US,TR",8,"Greece,Liberia,United States,Turkey","Europe,Africa,North America,Asia"
". that, at the end of the sixteenth century, the Scottish nation were advancing not less rapidly than their neighbours, in every species of mental cultivation, is sufficiently attested by their literary remains, both in the Latin language and in then- own vernacular tongue. A remarkable testimony to the same purpose occurs in the dialogue above quoted, the author of which had spent the best years of his life in the most polished society of the Continent. “ As often,” says Buchanan, as I turn my eyes to the niceness and elegance of our own times, the ancient manners of our forefathers appear sober and venerable, but withal rough and horrid.”—“ Quoties oculosad nostri temporis munditiaset elegantiam refero, antiquitas ilia sancta et sobiia, sed horrida tamen, et nondum satis expolita fuisse videtur.”—(De Jure Regni apud Scotos.')

"HOBBES.* « The philosopher of Malmesbury,” says Dr Warburton, “ was the terror of the last age, as Tindall and Collins are of this. The press sweat with controversy; and every young churchman militant, would try his arms in thundering on Hobbes’s steel cap. 5 Nor was the opposition to Hobbes confined to the clerical order, or to the controversialists of his own times. The most eminent moralists and politi¬ cians of the eighteenth century may be ranked in the number of his antagonists; and even at the present moment, scarcely does there appear a new publication on Ethics or Jurisprudence, where a refutation of Hobbism is not to be found","Malmesbury, Warburton","ZA,PK",8,"South Africa,Pakistan","Africa,Asia"
"All men are by nature equal; and, prior to government, they had all an equal right to en¬ joy the good things of this world. Man, too, is (according to Hobbes) by nature a solitary and purely selfish animal; the social union being en¬ tirely an interested league, suggested by pruden¬ tial views of personal advantage. The necessary consequence is, that a state of nature must be a state of perpetual warfare, in which no indivi¬ dual has any other means of safety than his own strength or ingenuity ; and in which there is no room for regular industry, because no secure en¬ joyment of its fruits. In confirmation of this view of the origin of society, Hobbes appeals to facts falling daily within the circle of our own experience. “ Does not a man (he asks), when taking a journey, arm himself, and seek to go well accompanied ? When going to sleep, does he not lock his doors ? Nay, even in his own house, does he not lock his chests ? Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words ?”1 An additional argu¬ ment to the same purpose may, according to some later Hobhists, be derived from the in¬ stinctive aversion of infants for strangers; and from the apprehension which, it is alleged, every person feels, when he hears the tread of an unknown foot in the dark",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"How much nearer the truth, even in the science of politics, is Bacon’s cardinal principle, that knowledge is power !—a principle, which applies to Man not less in his corporate than in his individual capacity ; and which may be safely trusted to as the most solid of all foundations for our reasonings concerning the future history of the world",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

"His constitutional temper, it is probable, pre¬ disposed him to scepticism; but this original bias could not fail to be mightily strengthened by the disputes, both religious and political, which, during his lifetime, convulsed Europe, and more particularly his own country. On a mind like his it may be safely presumed, that the writings of the Reformers, and the instruc¬ tions of Buchanan, were not altogether without effect; and hence, in all probability, the per¬ petual struggle, which he is at no pains to con¬ ceal, between the creed of his infancy, and the lights of his mature understanding. He speaks, indeed, of ££ reposing tranquilly on the pillow of doubtbut this language is neither reconcileable with the general complexion of his works, nor with the most authentic accounts we have re¬ ceived of his dying moments.

"2 Montaigne s education, however, had not been neglected by his father. On the contrary, he tells us himself, that George Buchanan, the great poet of Scotland, and Marcus Antonius Muretus, the best orator of his time, were among the number of his domestic preceptors.”—“ Buchanan,” he adds, “ when I saw him afterwards in the retinue of the late Mareschal de Brissac, told me, that he was about to write a treatise on the education of children, and that he would take the model of it from mine.”—Book i. chap. xxv",Buchanan,LR,8,Liberia,Africa
"51 expired in performing what his old preceptor Buchanan would not have scrupled to describe as an act of idolatry.1 2 The scepticism of Montaigne seems to have been of a very peculiar cast, and to have had little in common with that either of Bayle or of Hume. The great aim of the two latter writers evidently was, by exposing the uncertainty of our reasonings whenever we pass the limit of sensible objects, to inspire their readers with a complete distrust of the human faculties on all moral and metaphysical topics. Montaigne, on the other hand, never thinks of forming a sect; hut, yielding passively to the current of his re¬ flections and feelings, argues, at different times, according to the varying state of his impressions and temper, on opposite sides of the same ques¬ tion. On all occasions, he preserves an air of the most perfect sincerity; and it was to this, I presume, much more than to the superiority of his reasoning powers, that Montesquieu al¬ luded, when he said, “ In the greater part of authors I see the writer; in Montaigne I see nothing hut the thinker.” The radical fault of his understanding consisted in an incapacity of forming, on disputable points, those decided and fixed opinions which can alone impart either force or consistency to intellectual character",Buchanan,LR,8,Liberia,Africa

"amples of this occurs in the acquired perceptions of sight, where our estimates of distance are frequently the result of an intellectual process, comparing a variety of different signs together, without a possibility on our part, the moment afterwards, of recalling one single step of the process to our recollection. Our inattention to the sensations of colour, consiclered as affections of the Mind, or as modifications of our own being, appears to me to he a fact of precisely the same description; for all these sensations were plainly intended by nature to perform the office of signs, indicating to us the figures and distances of things external. Of their essential importance in this point of view, an idea may be formed, by supposing for a moment the whole face of nature to exhibit only one uniform colour, without the slightest variety even of light and shade. Is it not self-evident that, on this sup¬ position, the organ of sight would be entirely useless, inasmuch as it is by the varieties of colour alone that the outlines or visible figures of bodies are so defined, as to be distinguishable one from another ? Nor could the eye, in this case, give us any information concerning diver¬ sities of distance ; for all the various signs of it, enumerated by optical writers, pre-suppose the antecedent recognition of the bodies around us, as separate objects of perception. It is not there¬ fore surprising, that signs so indispensably sub¬ servient to the exercise of our noblest sense, should cease, in early infancy, to attract notice as the subjects of our consciousness; and that afterwards they should present themselves to the imagination rather as qualities of Matter, than as attributes of Mind.1 To this reference of the sensation of colour to the external object, I can think of nothing so analogous as the feelings we experience in sur¬ veying a library of books. We speak of the volumes piled up on its shelves, as treasures or magazines of the knowledge of past ages; and contemplate them with gratitude and reverence, as inexhaustible sources of instruction and delight to the mind. Even in looking at a page of print or of manuscript, we are apt to say, that the ideas we acquire are received by the sense of sight; and we are scarcely conscious of a metaphor, when we employ this language. On such oc¬ casions we seldom recollect, that nothing is per¬ ceived by the eye but a multitude of black strokes drawn upon white paper, and that it is our own acquired habits which communicate to these strokes the whole of that significancy whereby they are distinguished from the unmeaning scrawling of an infant or a changeling. The knowledge which we conceive to be preserved in books, like the fragrance of a rose, or the gild¬ ing of the clouds, depends, for its existence, on the relation between the object and the percipient mind; and the only difference between the two cases is, that in the one, this relation is the local and temporary effect of conventional habits; in the other, it is the universal and the unchange¬ able work of nature. The art of printing, it is to be hoped, will in future render the former relation, as well as the latter, coeval with our species; but, in the past history of mankind, it is impossible to say how often it may have been dissolved. What vestiges can now be traced of those scientific attainments which, in early times, drew to Egypt, from every part of the civilised world, all those who were anxious to be initia¬ ted in the mysteries of philosophy ? The sym¬ bols which still remain in that celebrated coun¬ try, inscribed on eternal monuments, have long lost the correspondent which reflected upon them their own intellectual attributes. To us ' In Dr Iteid’s Inquiry, he has introduced a discussion concerning the perception of visible figure, which has puzzled me since the first time (more than forty years ago) that I read his work. The discussion relates to this question, “ Whether there be any sensation proper to visible figure, by which it is suggested in vision ?” The result of the argument is, that “ our eye might have been so framed as to suggest the figure of the object, without suggesting colour, or any other quality ; and, of consequence, there seems to be no sensation appropriated to visible figure; this quality being suggested immediately by the material impression upon the organ, of which impression we are not conscious.”—Inquiry, chap. vi. sect. 8. To my apprehension, nothing can appear more manifest than this, that, if there had been no variety in our sensations of colour, and still more, if we had had no sensation of colour whatsoever, the organ of sight could have given us no information, either with respect to figures or to distances ; and, of consequence, would have been as useless to us, as if we had been af¬ flicted, from the moment of our birth, with a gutta serena",Of,"EG,TR",8,"Egypt,Turkey","Africa,Asia"
"At length, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, he accidentally met with Descartes’ Tfeatise on Man, which opened to him at once a new world, and awakened him to a consciousness of powers, till then unsuspected either by himself or by others. Fontenelle has given a lively picture of the enthusiastic ardour with which Malebranche first read this performance; and describes its effects on his nervous system as sometimes so great, that he was forced to lay aside the book till the palpitation of his heart had subsided",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"The unconnected fragment of Pascal, entitled Thoughts on Religion, contains various reflec¬ tions which are equally just and ingenious; some which are truly sublime; and not a few which are false and puerile: the whole, how¬ ever, deeply tinctured with that ascetic and mor¬ bid melancholy, which seems to have at last produced a partial eclipse of his faculties. Vol¬ taire has animadverted on this fragment with much levity and petulance; mingling, at the same time, with many very exceptionable stric¬ tures, several of which it is impossible to dispute the justness. The following reflection is worthy of Addison, and bears a strong resemblance in its spirit to the amiable lessons inculcated in his papers on Cheerfulness;1 “To consider the world as a dungeon, and the whole human race as so many criminals doomed to execution, is the idea of an enthusiast; to suppose the world to be a seat of delight, where we are to expect nothing but pleasure, is the dream of a Sybarite ; but to conclude that the Earth, Man, and the lower Animals, are, all of them, subservient to the purposes of an unerring Providence, is, in my opinion, the system of a wise and good man.” From the sad history of this great and excel¬ lent person (on whose deep superstitious gloom it is the more painful to dwell, that, by an un¬ accountable, though not singular coincidence, it was occasionally brightened by the inoffen¬ sive play of a lively and sportive fancy) the eye turns with pleasure to repose on the mitts sa- pientta, and the Elysian imagination of Fenelon","Addison, Man, Providence","US,CI",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire","North America,Africa"
"In spite of these defects, or rather, perhaps, in consequence of some of them, the impression produced by the treatise in question, on its first publication, was singularly great. The stores of erudition displayed in it recommended it to the classical scholar; while the happy applica¬ tion of the author’s reading to the affairs of hu¬ man life, drew the attention of such men as Gustavus Adolphus; of his Prime Minister, the Chancellor Oxenstiern; and of the Elector Pa¬ latine, Charles Lewis. The last of these was so struck with it, that he founded at Heidelberg a Professorship for the express purpose of teach¬ ing the Law of Nature and Nations;—an office which he bestowed on Puffendorff, the most noted, and, on the whole, the most eminent of those who have aspired to tread in the footsteps of Grotius",Heidelberg,ZA,8,South Africa,Africa
"That moral distinctions are created entirely by the arbitrary and revealed will of God, had, be¬ fore his time, been zealously maintained by some theologians even of the reformed church; while, among the political theorists of the same period, it was not unusual to refer these distinctions (as was afterwards done hy Hobbes) to the positive institutions of the civil magistrate. In opposi¬ tion to both, it was contended hy Grotius, that there is a natural law coeval with the human constitution, from which positive institutions derive all their force; a truth which, how ob¬ vious and trite soever it may now appear, was so opposite in its spirit to the illiberal systems taught in the monkish establishments, that he thought it necessary to exhaust in its support all his stores of ancient learning. The older waiters on Jurisprudence must, I think, he al¬ lowed to have had great merit in dwelling so much on this fundamental principle; a principle which renders “ Man a Law to himself;” and which, if it be once admitted, reduces the meta¬ physical question concerning the nature of the moral faculty, to an object merely of speculative curiosity.1 2 To this faculty the ancients fre¬ quently give the name of reason; as in that noted passage of Cicero, where he observes, that “ right reason is itself a law ; congenial to the feelings of nature; diffused among all men; uniform ; eternal; calling us imperiously to our duty, and peremptorily prohibiting every viola¬ tion of it. Nor does it speak,” continues the same author, “ one language at Rome and ano¬ ther at Athens, varying from place to place, or time to time; hut it addresses itself to all na¬ tions and to all ages; deriving its authority from the common sovereign of the universe, and carrying home its sanctions to every breast, hy the inevitable punishment which it inflicts on transgressors.”3 The habit of considering morality under the similitude of a law (a law engraved on the hu¬ man heart), led not unnaturally to an applica¬ tion to ethical subjects of the technical language and arrangements of the Roman jurisprudence, and this innovation was at once facilitated and 1 “ Upon whatever we suppose that our moral faculties are founded, whether upon a certain modification of reason, upon an original instinct, called a moral sense, or upon some other principle of our nature, it cannot be doubted that they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They carry along with them the most evident badges of this autho¬ rity, which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, to superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained. The rules, therefore, which they prescribe, are to be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those vicege¬ rents which he has set up within us.”—Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part in. chap, v.)—See also Dr Butler’s very original and philosophical Discourses on Human Nature","Man, Cicero, Rome, Athens, Roman","US,CI,RO",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire,Romania","North America,Africa,Europe"

Heineccius, a native of Saxony, in a Sketch of the History of Philosophy, printed in 1728, omits altogether the name of Locke in his enumeration of the logical and metaphysical writers of modern Europe. In a passage of his logic, where the same author treats of clear and obscure, adequate and inadequate ideas (a subject on which little or nothing of any value had been advanced before Locke), he observes, in a note, “ Debemus hanc Doctrinam Leibnitio, eamque deinde sequutus est illust.

If Pope had ever looked into this Treatise, he could not have committed so gross a mistake, as to introduce the author into the Dunciad, among Locke’s Aristotelian opponents; a distinction for which Crousaz was probably indebted to his acute strictures on those passages in the Essay on Man, which seem favourable to fatalism","Of, Man","TR,CI",8,"Turkey,Côte d'Ivoire","Asia,Africa"

"In what respects Locke’s account of the origin of our ideas falls short of the truth, will appear, when the metaphysical discussions of later times come under our review. Enough has been al¬ ready said to show, how completely this account has been misapprehended, not only by his oppo¬ nents, but by the most devoted of his admirers ;— a misapprehension so very general, and at the same time so obviously at variance with the whole spirit of his Essay, as to prove to a de¬ monstration that, in point of numbers, the in¬ telligent readers of this celebrated work have hitherto borne but a small proportion to its purchasers and panegyrists. What an illustra¬ tion of the folly of trusting, in matters of lite¬ rary history, to the traditionary judgments copied by one commentator or critic from another, when recourse may so easily be had to the original sources of information I1 II. Another misapprehension, not less pre¬ valent than the former, with respect to Locke’s philosophical creed, relates to the power of mo¬ ral perception, and the immutability of moral distinctions. The consideration of such ques- 1 In justice to Dr Hartley, I must here observe, that, although his account of the origin of our ideas is precisely the same with that of Gassendi, Hobbes, and Condillac—one of his fundamental principles being, that the ideas of sensation are the elements of which all the rest are compounded—(Hartley on Man, 4th Ed. p. 2. of the Introduction)—he has not availed himself, like the other Gassendists of later times, of the name of Locke to recommend this theory to the favour of his readers. On the contrary, he has very clearly and candidly pointed out the wide and essential distinction between the two opinions. “ It may not be amiss here to take notice how far the theory of these papers has led me to differ, in respect of logic, from Mr Locke’s excellent Essay on the Human Understanding, to which the world is so much indebted for re¬ moving prejudices and encumbrances, and advancing real and useful knowledge",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"“ First, then, it appears to me, that all the most complex ideas arise from sensation, and that reflection is not a distinct source, as Mr Locke makes it.”—(Hartley on Man, 4th Ed. p. 360 of the Introduction.) This last proposition Hartley seems to have considered as an important and original improvement of his own on Locke’s it no mean praise, if I have been sometimes able to dispose into method, to collect into heads and articles, or to exhibit in more compact and tangible masses, what, in that excellent performance, is spread over too much surface.”—(Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, Preface, pp. 25, 26.) Of an author whom Dr Paley has honoured with so very warm an eulogy, it would be equally absurd and presumptuous to dispute the merits. Nor have I any wish to detract from the praise here bestowed on him as an original thinker and ob¬ server. I readily admit, also, his talent for illustration, although it sometimes leads him to soar into bombast, and more frequently to sink into buffoonery. As an honest inquirer after moral and religious truth, he is entitled to the most un¬ qualified approbation. But, I must be permitted to add, that, as a metaphysician, he seems to me much more fanciful than solid ; and, at the same time, to be so rambling, verbose, and excursive, as to be more likely to unsettle than to fix the principles of his readers","Man, Of","CI,TR",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,Turkey","Africa,Asia"
"Innate is a word he poorly plays upon : the right word, though less used, is connatural. For what has birth or progress of the foetus out of the womb to do in this case ?—the question is not about the time the ideas entered, or the moment that one body came out of the other; but whe¬ ther the constitution of man be such, that, being adult and grown up, “ at such a time, sooner or later (no matter when,) the idea and sense of order, administration, and a God, will not infal¬ libly, inevitably, necessarily spring up in him.” In this last remark Shaftesbury appears to me to place the question about innate ideas upon the right and only philosophical footing; and to af¬ ford a key to all the confusion running through Locke’s argument against their existence. The sequel of the above quotation is not less just and valuable—but I must not indulge myself in any farther extracts. It is sufficient to mention the perfect coincidence between the opinion of Shaftesbury, as here stated by himself, and that formerly quoted in the words of Locke; and, of consequence, the injustice of concluding, from some unguarded expressions of the latter, that there was, at bottom, any essential difference between their real sentiments.5 Under the title of Locke’s Metaphysical (or, to speak with more strict precision, his Logical) writings, may also be classed his tracts on Edu¬ cation, and on the Conduct of the Understand- 1 To the above quotations from Locke, the following deserves to be added: “ Whilst the parties of men cram their tenets down all men’s throats, whom they can get into their power, without permitting them to examine their truth or falsehood, and will not let truth have fair play in the world, nor men the liberty to search after it; what improvements can be expected of this kind ? What greater light can be hoped for in the moral sciences ?

"With respect to the manner in which the intercourse between Mind and Matter is carried on, a very rash assertion escaped Mr Locke in the first edition of his Essay. “ The next thing to be considered is, how bodies produce ideas in us, and that is manifestly by impulse, the only way which we can conceive bodies operate in.”—(Essay, B. II. ch. viii. § 11.) In the course of Locke’s controversial discussions with the Bishop of Worcester, he afterwards became fully sensible of this important oversight; and he had the candour to acknowledge his error in the following terms : “ ’lis true, I have said, that bodies operate by impulse, and nothing else. And so I thought when I writ it, and can yet conceive no other way of their operations. But I am since convinced, by the judicious Mr Newton’s incomparable book^ that it is too bold a presumption to limit God’s power in this point by my narrow conceptions. *•*»*« And, therefore, in the next edi¬ tion of my book, I will take care to have that passage rectified.” . .

"led to hazard principles more dangerous in their consequences, than the prejudices and errors which it was their aim to correct.1 The zeal of Leibnitz in propagating the dogma of Necessity is not easily reconcileable with the hostility which, as I have already remarked, he uniformly displays against the congenial doctrine of Materialism. Such, however, is the fact, and I believe it to be quite unprecedented in the pre¬ vious history of philosophy. Spinoza himself has not pushed the argument for necessity further than Leibnitz,—the reasonings of both conclud¬ ing not less forcibly against the free-will of God than against the free-will of man, and, of con¬ sequence, terminating ultimately in this pro¬ position, that no event in the universe could possibly have been different from what has actu¬ ally taken place.3 The distinguishing feature of this article of theLeibnitzian creed is, that, while the Hobbists and Spinozists were employing their ingenuity in connecting together Materialism and Necessity, as branches springing from one common root, Leibnitz always speaks of the soul as a machine purely spiritual,5—a machine, how¬ ever, as necessarily regulated by pre-ordained and immutable laws, as the movements of a clock or the revolutions of the planets. In consequence of holding this language, he seemed to represent Man in a less degrading light than other neces¬ sitarians ; but, in as far as such speculative te- events does the crime of Sextus draw after it ?

It was, however, in little else than his physical principles that he agreed with Descartes; for no two philosophers ever differed more widely in their metaphysical and theological tenets. Fontenelle characterises his system as a {< Cartesianism pushed to extra¬ vagance” (une Cartesianisme outree) ; an expres¬ sion which, although far from conveying a just or adequate idea of the whole spirit of his doctrines, applies very happily to his boldness and pertinacity in following out his avowed principles to the most paradoxical consequences which he conceived them to involve. The re¬ putation of his writings, accordingly, has fallen entirely (excepting perhaps in Germany and in Holland) with the philosophy on which they were grafted; although some of the most ob¬ noxious opinions contained in them are still, from time to time, obtruded on the world, un¬ der the disguise of a new form, and of a phra¬ seology less revolting to modern taste.1 2 3 * In no part of Spinoza’s works has he avowed himself an atheist; hut it will not be disputed, by those who comprehend the drift of his rea¬ sonings, that, in point of practical tendency, Atheism and Spinozism are one and the same","Secunda, Holland","DE,ZA,US",8,"Germany,South Africa,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"

Unconnected as these different branches of know¬ ledge may at first appear, the theories of Spinoza and of Hobbes concerning all of them, formed parts of one and the same system; the whole terminating ultimately in the maxim with which, according to Plutarch, Anaxarchus consoled Alex¬ ander after the murder of Clytus: riav ro avo rob xodrouroe hxalov inai. Even in discussing the question about Liber¬ ty and Necessity, Hobbes cannot help glancing at this political corollary. “ The power of God alone is a sufficient justifica¬ tion of any action he doth.” “ That which he doth is made just by his doing it.” “ Power irresistible justifies all actions really and properly, in whomsoever it be found.”—(Of Liberty and Necessity, addressed to the Lord Marquis of Newcastle.) Spinoza has expressed himself exactly to the same purpose—(See his Tractatus Politicus, Cap. 2. §§ 3, 4.) So steadily, indeed, is this practical application of their abstract principles kept in view by both these writers, that not one generous feeling is ever suffered to escape the pen of either in favour of the rights, the liberties, or the improvement of their species",Newcastle,ZA,8,South Africa,Africa

"8 Among the various forms which religious enthusiasm assumes, there is a certain prostration of the mind, which, under the specious disguise of a deep humility, aims at exalting the Divine perfections, by annihilating all the powers which belong to Human Nature. “ Nothing is more usual for fervent devotion (says Sir James Mackintosh, in speaking of some theories current among the Hindoos), than to dwell so long and so warmly on the meanness and worthlessness of created things, and on the all-sufficiency of the Supreme Being, that it slides insensibly from comparative to absolute lan¬ guage, and in the eagerness of its zeal to magnify the Deity seems to annihilate everything else.”—(See Philosophy oj the Human Mind, Vol. II. p. 529, 2d ed.) This excellent observation may serve to account for the zeal displayed by Bonnet, and many other devout men, in fa¬ vour of the Scheme of Necessity. “ We have nothing (they frequently and justly remind us) but what we have re¬ ceived.”—But the question here is simply a matter of fact, whether we have or have not received from God the gift of Free Will; and the only argument, it must be remembered, which they have yet been able to advance for the nega¬ tive proposition, is, that this gift was impossible, even for the power of God ; nay, the same argument which annihi¬ lates the power of Man, annihilates that of God also, and subjects him, as well as all his creatures, to the control of causes which he is unable toOresist. So completely does this scheme defeat the pious views in which it has sometimes originated.—I say sometimes; for the very same argument against the liberty of the Will is employed by Spinoza, ac¬ cording to whom the free-agency of man* involves the absurd supposition of an imperium in imperio in the universe— (Tructat.

"depth,1 are to be numbered among the charac- teristical attributes of his genius. Far less does he ever anticipate, by the moral lights of the soul, the slow and hesitating decisions of the un¬ derstanding; or touch with a privileged hand those mysterious chords to which all the social sympathies of our frame are responsive. Had his ambition, however, been more exalted, or his philanthropy more warm and diffusive, he would probably have attempted less than he actually accomplished ; nor would he have stooped to en¬ joy that undisputed pre-eminence which the public voice has now unanimously assigned him, among those inestimable though often ill requit¬ ed authors, whom Johnson has called “ the pioneers of literature.” The suspense of judgment which Bayle’s Dictionary inspires with respect to facts, is, per¬ haps, still more useful than that which it en¬ courages in matters of abstract reasoning. Fon- tenelle certainly went much too far, when he said of history, that it was only a collection of Fables Convenues ;—a most significant and happy phrase, to which I am sorry that I cannot do justice in an English version. But though Fon- tenelle pushed his maxim to an extreme, there is yet a great deal of important truth in the re¬ mark ; and of this I believe every person’s con¬ viction will he stronger, in proportion as his knowledge of men and of books is profound and extensive.2 Of the various lessons of historical scepticism to be learned from Bayle, there is none more practically valuable (more especially in such revolutionary times as we have witnessed) than that which relates to the biographical portraits of distinguished persons, when drawn by their theological and political opponents. In illustra¬ tion of this, I have only to refer to the copious and instructive extracts which he has produced from Roman Catholic writers, concerning the lives, and still more concerning the deaths, of Luther, Knox,5 Buchanan, and various other leaders or partizans of the Reformation. It would be impossible for any well-informed Pro¬ testant to read these extracts, without indulging a smile at their incredible absurdity, if every feeling of levity were not lost in a sentiment of deep indignation at the effrontery and falsehood of their authors. In stating this observation, I have taken my examples from Roman Catholic libellers, without any illiberal prejudices against the members of that church. The injustice done by Protestants to some of the conscientious de¬ fenders of the old faith has been, in all probabi¬ lity, equally great; but this we have no oppor¬ tunity of ascertaining here, by the same direct evidence to which we can fortunately appeal, in vindication of the three characters mentioned above. With the history of two of them every person in this country is fully acquainted; and I have purposely selected them in preference to others, as their names alone are sufficient to cover with disgrace the memory of their calumniators.4 A few years before the death of Bayle, Fon- tenelle began to attract the notice of Europe.5 I class them together on account of the mighty influence of both on the literary taste of their contemporaries; an influence in neither case founded on any claims to original genius, or to important improvements; but on the attractions which they possessed in common, though in very different ways, as popular writers; and on the easy and agreeable access which their works opened to the opinions and speculations of the * I speak of that metaphysical depth which is the exclusive result of what Newton called patient thinking.

"Berkeley, on the other hand, courted the society of all, from whose conversation and manners he could hope to add to the embellishments of his genius; and although himself a decided and High Church Tory,1 lived in habits of friend¬ ship with Steele and Addison, as well as with Pope and Swift. Pope’s admiration of him seems to have risen to a sort of enthusiasm. He yielded to Berkeley’s decision on a very delicate question relating to the exordium of the Essay on Man; and on his moral qualities he has be¬ stowed the highest and most unqualified eulogy to be found in his writings","Berkeley, Addison, Berkeley, Man","US,CI",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire","North America,Africa"
"175 the rest. But this difficulty arises merely from his own peculiar and paradoxical theory about the artificial origin of society; a theory which needs no refutation, but the short and luminous aphorism of Montesquieu, that “ man is born in society, and there he remains.” The other dif¬ ficulties touched upon by Rousseau, in the for¬ mer part of this quotation, are much more se¬ rious, and have never yet been removed in a manner completely satisfactory: And hence some very ingenious writers have been led to conclude, that language could not possibly have been the work of human invention. This ar¬ gument has been lately urged with much acute¬ ness and plausibility by Dr Magee of Dublin, and by M. de Bonald of Paris.1 It may, how¬ ever, be reasonably questioned, if these philoso¬ phers would not have reasoned more logically, had they contented themselves with merely af¬ firming, that the problem has not yet been solv¬ ed, without going so far as to pronounce it to n be absolutely insolvable. For my own part, when I consider its extreme difficulty, and the short space of time during which it has engaged the attention of the learned, I am more dispos¬ ed to wonder at the steps which have been al¬ ready gained in the research, than at the num¬ ber of desiderata which remain to employ the ingenuity of our successors. It is justly re¬ marked by Dr Ferguson, that, “ when language has attained to that perfection to which it ar¬ rives in the progress of society, the speculative mind, in comparing the first and the last stages of the progress, feels the same sort of amaze¬ ment with a traveller, who, after rising insen¬ sibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look down from a precipice, to the summit of which he scarcely believes he could have ascended with¬ out supernatural aid.”2 With respect to some of the difficulties point¬ ed out by Rousseau and his commentators, it may be here remarked in passing (and the ob¬ servation is equally applicable to various pas¬ sages in Mr Smith’s dissertation on the same subject), that the difficulty of explaining the theory of any of our intellectual operations af¬ fords no proof of any difficulty in applying that operation to its proper practical purpose; nor is the difficulty of explaining the metaphysical nature of any part of speech a proof, that, in its first origin, it implied any extraordinary effort of intellectual capacity. How many metaphy¬ sical difficulties might be raised about the ma¬ thematical notion of a line ? And yet this notion is perfectly comprehended by every peasant, when he speaks of the distance between two places; or of the length, breadth, or height of his cottage. In like manner, although it may be difficult to give a satisfactory account of the origin and import of such words as of or by, we ought not to conclude, that the invention of them implied any metaphysical knowledge in 1 The same theory has been extended to the art of writing; but if this art was first taught to man by an express reve¬ lation from Heaven, what account can be given of its present state in the great empire of China ?

To this observation may be added, by way of com¬ ment, the following reflections of one of the most learned prelates of the English church :—“ Man, we are told, had a lan¬ guage from the beginning; for he conversed with God, and gave to every animal its particular name. But how came man by language ? He must either have had it from inspiration, ready formed from his Creator, or have derived it by the exer¬ tion of those faculties of the mind, which were implanted in him as a rational creature, from natural and external objects with which he was surrounded. Scripture is silent on the means by which it was acquired. We are not, therefore, war¬ ranted to affirm, that it was received by inspiration, and there is no internal evidence in language to lead us to such a sup¬ position. On this side, then, of the question, we have nothing but uncertainty; but on a subject, the causes of which are so remote, nothing is more convenient than to refer them to inspiration, and to recur to that easy and comprehensive argu¬ ment, Ails irsXusro (houXn' that is, man enjoyed the great privilege of speech, which distinguished him at first, and still continues to distinguish him as a rational creature, so eminently from the brute creation, without exerting those reasoning faculties, by which he was in other respects enabled to raise himself so much above their level. Inspiration, then, seems to have been an argument adopted and made necessary by the difficulty of accounting for it otherwise; and the name of inspiration carries with it an awfulness, which forbids the unhallowed approach of inquisitive discussion.”—(Essay on the Study of Antiquities, by Dr Bur¬ gess, 2d edit. Oxford, 1732. Pp. 85, 86.) It is farther remarked very sagaciously, and I think very decisively, by the same author, that “ the supposition of man having received a language ready formed from his Creator, is actually inconsistent with the evidence of the origin of our ideas, which exists in language For, as the origin of our ideas is to be traced in the words through which the ideas are conveyed, so the origin oflanguage is referable to the source from whence our (first) ideas are derived, namely, nature1 and external objects.”—(Ibid. pp. 83, 84.) 176 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Dublin, Paris, Man, Oxford","US,CN,CI,UK",8,"United States,China,Côte d'Ivoire,N/A","North America,Asia,Africa,N/A"

"One of his distinguishing doctrines is, that the Deity is the immediate agent in producing the phenomena of the Material World ; but that, in the Moral World, the case is different,—a doctrine which, whatever may be thought of it in other respects, is undoubtedly a great im¬ provement on that of Malebranche, which, by representing God as the only agent in the uni¬ verse, was not less inconsistent than the scheme of Spinoza with the moral nature of Man. “ The Deity (says Baxter) is not only at the bead of Nature, but in every part of it. A chain of material causes betwixt the Deity and the effect produced, and much more a series of them, is such a supposition as would conceal the Deity from the knowledge of mortals for ever.

"The great object of his studies plainly was, to strengthen the old argument for the soul’s im¬ materiality, by the new lights furnished by New¬ ton’s discoveries. To the intellectual and moral phenomena of Man, and to the laws by which they are regulated, he seems to have paid hut little attention.® While Dr Hutcheson’s reputation as an au¬ thor, and still more as an eloquent teacher, was at its zenith in Scotland, Mr Hume began his literary career, by the publication of his Treatise of Human Nature. It appeared in 1739, but seems at that time to have attracted little or no attention from the public. According to the author himself, “ never literary attempt was more unfortunate. It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.” It forms, however, a very important link in this Historical Sketch, as it has contributed, either directly or indirectly, more than any other single work, to the subsequent progress of the Philo¬ sophy of the Human Mind. In order to adapt his principles better to the public taste, the author afterwards threw them into the more popular form of Essays; but it is in the original work that philosophical readers will always study his system, and it is there alone that the relations and bearings of its different parts, as well as its connection with the speculations of his imme¬ diate predecessors, can be distinctly traced. It is there, too, that his metaphysical talents ap¬ pear, in my opinion, to the greatest advantage; nor am I certain that he has anywhere else dis¬ played more skill or a sounder taste in point of composition.8 The great objects of Mr Hume’s Treatise of 1 Appendix to the first part of the Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul, pp. 109, 110",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"“ ’Tis evident that all the sciences have a re¬ lation, greater or less, to human nature, and that, however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one pas¬ sage or another. Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man, since they lie under the cognisance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties  If, therefore, the sciences of Mathematics, Na¬ tural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, have such a dependence on the knowledge of man, what may be expected in the other sciences, whose connection with human nature is more close and intimate ? The sole end of logic is to explain the principles and operations of our rea¬ soning faculty, and the nature of our ideas: Morals and criticism regard our tastes and sen¬ timents, and politics consider men as united in society, and dependent on each other  Here, then, is the only expedient from which we can hope for success in our philosophical re¬ searches, to leave the tedious lingering method which we have hitherto followed, and, instead of taking now and then a castle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to the capital or centre of these sciences, to human nature it¬ self; which, being once masters of, we may everywhere else hope for an easy victory. From this station we may extend our conquests over all those sciences which more intimately concern human life, and may afterwards proceed at lei¬ sure to discover more fully those which are the objects of pure curiosity. There is no question of importance whose decision is not comprised in the Science of Man, and there is none which can be decided with any certainty before we be¬ come acquainted with that science. In pre¬ tending, therefore, to explain the principles of Human Nature, we, in effect, propose a com¬ plete system of the sciences, built on a foun¬ dation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any security","Man, Man",CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"“ The author of an Inquiry into the Mind, and of subsequent Essays on the Intellectual and Active Powers of Man, has great merit in the effect to which he has pursued this history. But, considering the point at which the science stood when he began his inquiries, he has, perhaps, no less merit in having removed the mist of hypothesis and metaphor, with which the subject was enveloped; and, in having taught us to state the facts of which we are conscious, not in figurative language, but in the terms which are proper to the subject. In this it will be our advantage to follow him ; the more that, in former theories, so much attention had been paid to the introduction of ideas or images as the elements of knowledge, that the be¬ lief of any external existence or prototype has been left to be inferred from the mere idea or image; and this inference, indeed, is so little founded, that many who have come to examine its evidence have thought themselves warranted to deny it altogether. And hence the scepticism of ingenious men, who, not seeing a proper access to knowledge through the me¬ dium of ideas, without considering whether the road they had been directed to take was the true or a false one, denied the possibility of arriving at the end.”—(Principles of Moral and Political Science, by Dr Adam Ferguson, Vol. I. pp. 7b, 76.) The work from which this passage is taken contains various important observations connected with the Philosophy of the Human Mind; but as the taste of the author led him much more strongly to moral and political speculations, than to re¬ searches concerning the intellectual powers of man, I have thought it right to reserve any remarks which I have to offer on his philosophical merits for the last part of this Discourse","Man, Ferguson","CI,US",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,United States","Africa,North America"

They are less highly finished, both in matter and in form, than his Inquiry into the Human Mind. They contain also some repeti¬ tions, to which, I am afraid, I must add a few trifling inconsistencies of expression, for which the advanced age of the author, who was then approaching to fourscore, claims every indul¬ gence from a candid reader.

"Even in Bacon’s professional line, it is now admitted, by the best judges, that he was great¬ ly underrated by his contemporaries. “ The Queen did acknowledge,” says the Earl of Es¬ sex, in a letter to Bacon himself, “ you had a great wit, and an excellent gift of speech, and much other good learning. But in law, she ra¬ ther thought you could make shew, to the utmost of your knowledge, than that you were deep.” “ If it be asked,” says Dr Hurd, “ how the Queen came to form this conclusion, the answer is plain. It was from Mr Bacon’s having a great wit, an excellent gift of speech, and much other good learning.”—(Hurd’s Dialogues.) The following testimony to Bacon’s legal knowledge (pointed out to me by a learned friend) is of somewhat more weight than Queen Elizabeth’s judgment against it: <£ What might we not have expected,” says Mr Hargrave, af¬ ter a high encomium on the powers displayed by Bacon in his ‘ Reading on the Statute of Uses ;’ “ what might we not have expected from the hands of such a master, if his vast mind had not so embraced within its compass the whole field of science, as very much to detach him from professional studies !?> It was probably owing in part to his court- disgrace, that so little notice was taken of Ba- Notes con, for some time after his death, by those Eng- iiius^ad.ioni lish writers who availed themselves, without any scruple, of the lights struck out in his works. A very remarkable example of this oc¬ curs in a curious, though now almost forgotten hook (published in 1627), entitled, An Apology or Declaration of the Power and Providence of God in the Government of the World, by George Hakewill, D.

"The philosophical fame of Bacon in his own country may be dated from the establishment of the Royal Society of London; by the founders of which, as appears from their colleague, Dr Sprat, he was held in so high estimation, that it was once proposed to prefix to the history of their labours some of Bacon’s writings, as the best comment on the views with which they were undertaken. Sprat himself, and his illus¬ trious friend Cowley, were among the number of Bacon’s earliest eulogists; the latter in an Ode to the Royal Society, too well known to require any notice here; the former in a very splendid passage of his History, from which I shall borrow a few sentences, as a conclusion and ornament to this note","London, Cowley, Ode","GB,NG",8,"United Kingdom,Nigeria","Europe,Africa"

No conclusion, therefore, can be drawn against a man’s belief in his own free-agency, from his embracing other metaphysical or theological tenets, with which 1 Collins states this more strongly in what he says of the Pharisees. “ The Pharisees, who were a religious sect, as¬ cribed all things to fate or to God’s appointment, and it was the first article of their creed, that Fate and God do all, and, consequently, they could not assert a true liberty when they asserted a liberty together with this fatality and necessity of all things.”—(Collins, p. 54.) 2 We are elsewhere informed by Priestley, that “it was in consequence of reading and studying the Inquiry of Collins, he was first convinced of the truth of the doctrine of Necessity, and was enabled to see the fallacy of most of the arguments m favour of Philosophical Liberty: though (he adds) I was much more confirmed in this principle by my acquaintance with Hartley’s Theory of the Human Mind: a work to which I owe much more than I am able to express.”—(Preface, &c","Man, Birmingham","CI,US",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,United States","Africa,North America"

"But to affirm that right actions are those which conduce to the wellbeing of mankind, is a pro¬ position concerning the outward effects by which right actions themselves may be recog¬ nised. As these affirmations relate to different subjects, they cannot be opposed to each other, any more than the solidity of earth is inconsist¬ ent with the fluidity of water; and a very little reflection will show it to be easily conceivable that they may be both true. Man may be so constituted as instantaneously to approve cer¬ tain actions without any reference to their con¬ sequences ; and yet reason may nevertheless discover, that a tendency to produce general happiness is the essential characteristic of such actions. Mr Bentham also contrasts the prin¬ ciple of utility with that of sympathy, of which he considers the moral sense as being one of the forms.2 3 It is needless to repeat, that proposi¬ tions which affirm or deny anything of different subjects, cannot contradict each other. As these celebrated persons have thus inferred or implied the non-existence of a moral sense, from their opinion that the morality of actions depends upon their usefulness, so other philoso¬ phers of equal name have concluded, that the utility of actions cannot be the criterion of their morality, because a perception of that utility appears to them to form a faint and in¬ considerable part of our moral sentiments, if indeed it be at all discoverable in them.2 These errors are the more remarkable, because the like confusion of perceptions with their objects, of emotions with their causes, or even the omis¬ sion to mark the distinctions, would, in every other subject, be felt to be a most serious fault in philosophizing. If, for instance, an element were discovered to be common to all bodies which our taste perceives to be sweet, and to be found in no other bodies, it is apparent that this discovery, perhaps important in other respects, would neither affect our perception of sweet¬ ness, nor the pleasure which attends it. Both would continue to be what they have been since the existence of mankind. Every proposition concerning that element would relate to sweet bodies, and belong to the science of Chemistry; while every proposition respecting the percep¬ tion or pleasure of sweetness would relate either to the body or mind of man, and accordingly belong either to the science of Physiology, or to that of Mental Philosophy. During the many ages which passed before the analysis of the sun’s beams had proved them to be com¬ pounded of different colours, white objects were seen, and their whiteness was sometimes felt to be beautiful, in the very same manner as since that discovery.

"There is no scene in history so memorable as that in which Caesar mastered a nobility of which Lucullus and Hortensius, Sulpicius and Catulus, Pompey and Cicero, Brutus and Cato, were members. This renowned body had from the time of Scipio sought the Greek philosophy as an amusement or an ornament. Some few, <c in thought more elevate,” caught the love of truth, and were ambitious of discovering a solid foundation for the Rule of Life. The influence of the Grecian systems was tried by their effect on a body of men of the utmost originality, energy, and variety of character, during the five centuries between Carneades and Constantine, in their successive positions of rulers of the world, and of slaves under the best and under the worst of uncontrolled masters. If we had found this in¬ fluence perfectly uniform, we should have justly suspected our own love of system of having in part bestowed that appearance on it. Had there been no trace of such an influence discoverable in so great an experiment, we must have acquiesced in the paradox, that opinion does not at all affect conduct.

"The genius of Greece fell with liberty. The Grecian philosophy received its mortal wound in the contests between scepticism and dogma¬ tism which occupied the schools in the age of Cicero. The Sceptics could only perplex, and confute, and destroy. Their occupation was gone as soon as they succeeded. They had nothing to substitute for what they overthrew; and they rendered their own art of no further use. They were no more than venomous ani¬ mals, who stung their victims to death, but also breathed their last into the wound. A third age of Grecian literature indeed arose at Alex¬ andria, under the Macedonian kings of Egypt; laudably distinguished by exposition, criticism, and imitation, sometimes abused for the pur¬ poses of literary forgery, still more honoured by some learned and highly-cultivated poets, as well as by diligent cultivators of history and science; among whom some began about the first preaching of Christianity to turn their minds once more to that high philosophy which seeks for the fundamental principles of human knowledge. Philo, a learned and philosophical Hebrew, one of the flourishing colony of his na¬ tion established in that city, endeavoured to re¬ concile the Platonic Philosophy with the Mosaic Law and the Sacred Books of the Old Testa¬ ment. About the end of the second century, when the Christians, Hebrews, Pagans, and va¬ rious other sects of semi or Pseudo-Christian Gnostics appear to have studied in the same schools, the almost inevitable tendency of doc¬ trines, however discordant, in such circum¬ stances to amalgamate, produced its full effect under Ammonius Saccas; a celebrated Professor, who, by selection from the Greek systems, the Hebrew books, the oriental religions, and by some of that concession to the rising spirit of Christi¬ anity, of which the Gnostics had set the example, composed a very mixed system, commonly de- 1 The progress of commonplace satire on sexes or professions, and (he might have added) on nations, has been exquisitely touched by Gray in his Remarks on Lydgate ; a fragment containing passages as finely thought and written as any in Eng¬ lish prose.

"“ The various kinds of agreement and disagree¬ ment between our ideas, spoken of by Locke, are so many new simple ideas.” “ This is true of our ideas of proportion, of our ideas of iden¬ tity and diversity, existence, connection, cause and effect, power, possibility, and of our ideas of right and wrong.” “ The first relates to quantity, the last to actions, the rest to all things.” “ Like all other simple ideas, they are undefineable.” It is needless to pursue this theory farther, till an answer shall be given to the observation made before, that as no perception or judgment, or other unmixed act of understanding, merely as such, and without the agency of some inter¬ mediate emotion, can affect the will, the account given by Hr Price of perceptions or judgments respecting moral subjects, does not advance one step towards the explanation of the authority of conscience over the will, which is the matter to be explained. Indeed, this respectable writer felt the difficulty so much as to allow, “ that in contemplating the acts of moral agents, we have both a perception of the understanding and a feeling of the heart.” He even admits, that it would have been highly pernicious to us if our reason had been left without such support. But he has not shown how, on such a supposition, we could have acted on a mere opinion; nor has he given any proof that what he calls sup¬ port is not, in truth, the whole of what directly produces the conformity of voluntary acts to morality.1 * DAVID HARTLEY.* The work of Dr Hartley, entitled Observations on Man,3 is distinguished by an uncommon union of originality with modesty, in unfolding a simple and fruitful principle of human nature",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

"411 generation or two of a humble life spent in piety and usefulness, with no more than needful knowledge, have more than once sent forth a man of genius from their cool and quiet shade, to make his fellows wiser or better by tongue or pen, by head or hand. Even the scanty endow¬ ments and constant residence of that church, by keeping her ministers far from the objects which awaken turbulent passions and disperse the un¬ derstanding on many pursuits, afforded some of the leisure and calm of monastic life, without the exclusion of the charities of family and kin¬ dred. It may be well doubted whether this un¬ dissipated retirement, which during the eigh¬ teenth century was very general in Scotland, did not make full amends for the loss of curious and ornamental knowledge, by its tendency to quali¬ fy men for professional duty, by the cultivation of reason among a considerable number, and by those opportunities for high meditation, and for the unchangeable concentration of mind on wor¬ thy objects, to the few who had the natural capa¬ city for such exertions.1 An authentic account of the early exercises of Brown’s mind is preserved by his biographer.2 At the age of nineteen he took a part with others, some of whom became the most memorable men of their time, in the foundation of a private so¬ ciety in Edinburgh, under the name of “ the Academy of Physics.”3 The character of Dr Brown is very attractive, as an example of one in whom the utmost ten¬ derness of affection, and the indulgence of a flowery fancy, were not repressed by the high¬ est cultivation, and by a perhaps excessive re¬ finement of intellect. His mind soared and roamed through every region of philosophy and poetry; but his untravelled heart clung to the hearth of his father, to the children who shared it with him, and after them, first to the other part¬ ners of his childish sports, and then almost solely to those companions of his youthful studies who continued to be the friends of his life. Specula¬ tion seemed to keep his kindness at home. It is observable, that though sparkling with fancy, he does not seem to have been deeply or durably touched by those affections which are lighted at its torch, or at least tinged with its colours. His heart sought little abroad, but contentedly dwelt in his family and in his study. He was one of those men of genius who repaid the tender care of a mother by rocking the cradle of her repos¬ ing age. He ended a life spent in searching foi truth, and exercising love, by desiring that he should be buried in his native parish, with his <£ dear father and mother.” Some of these delightful qualities were perhaps hidden from the casual observer in general society, by the want of that perfect simplicity of manner which is doubtless their natural representative. Man¬ ner is a better mark of the state of a mind, than those large and deliberate actions which form what is called conduct. It is the constant and insensible transpiration of character. In serious acts a man may display himself. In the thou¬ sand nameless acts which compose manner, the mind betrays its habitual bent. But manner is then only an index of disposition, when it is that of men who live at ease in the intimate famili¬ arity of friends and equals. It may be diverted from simplicity by causes which do not reach so deep as the character; by bad models, or by a restless and wearisome anxiety to shine, arising from many circumstances, none of which are pro¬ bably more common than the unseasonable ex¬ ertions of a recluse student in society, and the 1 See Sib H.

"For we should remember that Man, when left in a state of nature, untaught, and with his ra¬ tional powers not unfolded, is far less fitted for supporting and taking care of himself than the brutes. They are much better provided both with instincts, and with bodily organs for sup¬ plying their own wants. For example, those animals that have occasion to dig, either for food or to make burrows for shelter—such as the swine, the hedgehog, the mole, and the rabbit, have both an instinct for digging, and snouts or paws far better adapted for that purpose than man’s hands. Yet man is enabled to turn up the ground much better than any brute; but then this is by means of tools which man can be taught to make and use, though brutes cannot. Again, birds and bees have an instinct for building such nests and habitations as answer their purpose as well as the most commodious beds and houses made by men; but Man has no instinct that teaches him how to construct these. Brutes, again, know by instinct their proper food, and avoid what is unwholesome; but man has no instinct for distinguishing the nightshade-berry (with which children have been so often poison¬ ed), from wholesome fruits.

And, consequently, the existence of civilisation at this day is a kind of monument attesting the fact that some instruc¬ tion from above must, at some time or other, have been supplied to mankind; And the most probable conclusion is, that Man, when first cre¬ ated, or very shortly afterwards, was advanced by the Creator Himself, to a state above that of a mere savage",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

For we read of Joseph’s marrying the daughter of an Egyptian priest (Gen. xli.), and though possible, it does not seem likely, that so eminently pious a man would have married the daughter of an idola¬ trous priest. This, at least, is certain, that the historian Plutarch speaks of a certain portion of the land of Egypt which was exempted from the tax levied on the rest for the support of ido¬ latrous worship. And this, he says, was on ac¬ count of their being worshippers only of ONE, whom they called Cneph, “ the unbegotten God.”1 And the plagues inflicted on Egypt by the Lord God of Israel,2 the complete dominion He dis¬ played over the Beings the idolaters worshipped, must, no doubt, have brought some of the Egyp¬ tians to acknowledge and worship Him.

"2 “ On all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment.”—(Exod. xii. 12.) 3 It is the opinion of many learned men that it was the practice of the servants of the true God, in the earliest times, to keep holy the last day of the week [Saturday] in memory of the close of the work of creation. And this seems probable, though no such practice is expressly recorded. But their mode of observing the day could hardly have been altogether the same with what was enjoined to the Israelites. To these the Sabbath seems to have been, in the particulars of the oh- servance, a new and a peculiar institution. And accordingly we find, in the Prophecy of Ezekiel, the Lord saying, “ I gav\ them [the Israelites] my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them.” 4 “ Let no man judge you” (says the Apostle Paul, when writing to the Gentiles), “ in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”—(Col. ii. 16.) 6 oS irtfoplvoi. 6 ol (pofiovpivot rov 0s<n^ _ ^ 7 These are called “ the Jews of the Dispersion” (see the beginning of the Epistle of James); or simply “ the Dispersion",,EG,8,Egypt,Africa

And He is thence called in Scripture, “ The Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.” And throughout the New Testament, there are numerous references to the sacrifices and other ceremonial ordinances of the law, as types repre¬ senting the redemption by Christ, and foreshow¬ ing the Gospel dispensation",,EG,8,Egypt,Africa
"On the actual belief, indeed, of the great mass of the Israelites, we have no means of deciding positively; but if any one should suppose most of them to have thought little or nothing, one way or the other, about what should become of them after death, nor, consequently, to have either be¬ lieved or disbelieved, properly speaking, the doc¬ trine in question, his conjecture certainly would not be at variance with the representations Moses gives of the grossness of ideas, and puerile short¬ sightedness of the nation; who, while fed by a daily miracle, and promised the especial favour of the Maker of the universe, had their minds set on “the flesh-pots of Egypt, and the fish, and the cucumbers, and the leeks.” Christians of these days are not surely more gross-minded and un¬ thinking than those Israelites; yet a large propor¬ tion of them require to be incessantly reminded that this life is not the whole of their existence ; though the doctrine be one which is expressly declared in their religion; and silence on that subject is quite sufficient, if not to eradicate from 475 their minds all belief, at least to put an end to all thought, about the matter",,EG,8,Egypt,Africa
"Since, then, no one of the first promulgators of Christianity did that which they must—some of them at least—have been naturally led to do, it follows that they must have been supernatu- rally withheld from it; how little soever we may be able even to conjecture the object of the prohi¬ bition. Form respect of this, and several other (humanly speaking, unaccountable) circumstances in our religion, it is important to observe, that the argument thence derivable in favour of the divine origin of Christianity, does not turn on the supposed wisdom of this or that appointment, which we conceive to be worthy of the Deity, and thence infer that the religion must have pro¬ ceeded from Him; but on the utter improbabi¬ lity of its having proceeded from Man ; which leaves its divine origin the only alternative. The Christian Scriptures considered in this point of view, present to us a standing Miracle ; at least, a Monument of a Miracle; since they are in several points such as we may be sure, accord¬ ing to all natural causes, they would not have been.

"Each church, therefore, was left, through the wise foresight of Him who alone “ knew what is in Man,” to provide for its own wants as they should arise;—to steer its own course by the Chart and Compass which his holy Word supplies, regu¬ lating for itself the Sails and Rudder, according to the winds and currents it may meet with.2 “ The Apostles had begun and established precedents, which, of course, would be naturally adopted by their uninspired successors. But still, as these were only the formal means of grace, and not the blessing itself, it was equally to be expected that the church should assume a discretionary power, whenever the means established became impracticable or clearlyunsuitable, and either sub¬ stitute others, or even altogether abolish such as existed  It might seem at first that the apostolical precedents were literally binding on all Ages ; but this cannot have been intended; and for this reason, that the greater portion of the apostolical practices have been transmitted to us, not on apostolical authority, but on the au¬ thority of the uninspired church ; which has handed them down with an uncertain mixture of its own appointments. How are we to know the enactments of the inspired rulers from those of the uninspired \ and if there be no certain clue, we must either bring down the authority of apos¬ tolical usage to that of the uninspired church, or raise that of the uninspired church to that of the apostolical. Now, the former is, doubtless, what was, to a certain extent, intended by the Apostles themselves ; as will appear from a line of distinction by which they have carefully par¬ titioned off such of their appointments as are de¬ signed to be perpetual, from such as are left to share the possibility of change, with the institu¬ tions of uninspired wisdom",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

"The Priests of the Israelites were appointed by the Almighty Himself, for the express purpose of offering sacrifices, in the name and on the be¬ half of the people ; they alone were allowed to make oblations and burn incense before the Lord; it was through them that the People were to ap¬ proach Him, that their service might be accept¬ able. A very great portion of the Jewish reli¬ gion consisted in the performance of certain cere¬ monial rites, most of which could only be duly performed by the Priests, or through their me¬ diation and assistance; they were to make in¬ tercession and atonement for offenders ; they, in short, were the mediators between God and Man",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

"Such being, then, the respective offices of these two Orders of men (both now commonly called in English, “ Priests,” but originally distinguish¬ ed by the names of Hiereus and Presbyteros), we may assert that the word in question is ambi¬ guous ; denoting, when thus applied to both, two things essentially distinct. It is not merely a comprehensive term, embracing two species under one class, but rather an equivocal term, applied, in different senses, to two things of dif¬ ferent classes. At least, it must be admitted, that what is most essential to each respectively, is wanting in the other. The essential charac¬ teristic of the Jewish Priests, was (not their be¬ ing ministers of religion; for that, in a certain sense, all the Levites were, but) their offering sacrifices, and making atonement and interces¬ sion for the. people ; whereas, of the Christian Minister, the especial office is religious instruc¬ tion, and the administration of rites altogether different in their nature from the offering of sacrifices ; totally precluding the idea of his being himself the mediator between God and Man",Man,"CI,UK",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,N/A","Africa,N/A"

He is himself ever at hand; and if any man will seek to do his will, “ He will come unto him, and make his abode in him by his Spirit.” Any one, therefore, who carefully follows the teaching of the Evangelists and Apostles, will be preserved from such errors as we have been speaking of. But it was the disposition of “ the Natural Man ” that originally led the Pagans to corrupt the Religion revealed to the earliest gene¬ rations, and to “ worship the creature more than the Creator.” And that very same disposition has led many of those Christians who neglect the guidance of Scripture, to introduce like cor¬ ruptions into Christianity","Man, Man",CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa
"And, we would further remark, that if it had been possible and allowable for us to follow up by metaphysical researches, the view opened to us by Revelation, and thus to enlarge our know¬ ledge of God’s dealings with Man, Paul (as well as the other Apostles) would not have censured, but favoured, such researches, and would have set us the example of so speculating. And if he had done this, even in those discourses of his which are not recorded in writing, we may be sure that his Gospel would not have been con¬ sidered as “foolishness” by the Greeks, even those of them who did not fully agree with him",Man,CI,8,Côte d'Ivoire,Africa

"Though the phenomena of the material world could not but early excite the curiosity of a being who, like man, receives his strongest im¬ pressions from without, yet an accurate know¬ ledge of those phenomena, and their laws, was not to be speedily acquired. The mere extent and variety of the objects were, indeed, such ob¬ stacles to that acquisition, as could not be sur¬ mounted but in the course of many ages. Man could not at first perceive from what point he must begin his inquiries, in what direction he must carry them on, or by what rules he must be guided. He was like a traveller going forth to explore a vast and unknown wilderness, in which a multitude of great and interesting ob¬ jects presented themselves on every side, while there was no path for him to follow, no rule to direct his survey, and where the art of observ¬ ing, and the instruments of observation, must equally be the work of his own invention. In these circumstances, the selection of the objects to be studied was the effect of instinct rather than of reason, or of the passions and emotions, more than of the understanding. When things new, and unlike those which occurred in the course of every day’s experience, presented themselves, they excited wonder or surprise, and created an anxiety to discover some principle which might connect them with the appearances commonly observed. About these last, men felt no desire to be further informed; but when the common order of things was violated, and something new or singular was produced, they began to exa¬ mine into the fact, and attempted to inquire into the cause. Nobody sought to know why a stone fell to the ground, why smoke ascended, or why the stars revolved round the earth. But if a fiery meteor shot across the heavens,—if the flames of a volcano burst forth,—or if an earthquake shook the foundations of the world, terror and curiosity were both awakened; and when the former emotion had subsided, the latter was sure to become active. Thus, to trace a resemblance between the events with which the observer was most familiar, and those to which he was less accustomed, and which had excited his wonder, was the first ob¬ ject of inquiry, and produced the first advances towards generalization and philosophy.* This principle, which it were easy to trace, 1 Wallis, Opera Math. tom.

"In considering some of the objections which might be made to the system of the earth’s mo¬ tion, Copernicus reasons with great soundness, though he is not aware of the full force of his own argument. Ptolemy had alleged, that if the earth were to revolve on its axis, the violence of the motion would be sufficient to tear it in pieces, and to dissipate the parts. This argu¬ ment, it is evident, proceeds on a confused notion of a centrifugal force, the effect of which the Egyptian astronomer overrated, as much as he undervalued the firmness and solidity of the earth. Why, says Copernicus, was he not more alarmed for the safety of the heavens, if the diur¬ nal revolution be ascribed to them, as their mo¬ tion must be more rapid, in proportion as their magnitude is greater ? The argument here sug¬ gested, now that we know how to measure centri¬ fugal force, and to compare it with others, carries demonstrative evidence with it; because that force, if the diurnal revolution were really per¬ formed by the heavens, would be such as the forces which hold together the frame of the ma¬ terial world would be wholly unable to resist",,EG,8,Egypt,Africa
"The first idea of this institution seems to have been suggested by the writings of Bacon, who, in recommending the use of experiment, had severely censured the schools, colleges, and aca¬ demies of his own time, as adverse to the ad¬ vancement of knowledge;1 * * * and, in the Nova Atlantis, had given a most interesting sketch of the form of a society directed to scientific im¬ provement.

"No doubt we cannot in strictness call Watt the f3.17-) inventor of the steam-engine. The grand principle of rendering the heat contained in steam available as engine, an economical source of moving power may be traced so far back that we lose the clue altogether in the obscure, or impracticable, or simply puerile shapes in w hich the idea was contained. Even in the time of Worcester (1663) we must be allowed to doubt whether the history of the steam-engine had out¬ grown the mythical stage ; Papin, indeed, proposed a piston and cylinder in which the vacuum was pro¬ duced by steam instead of by the air-pump (as already suggested or practised by Guericke) ; but Savery (16 98) was the first who constructed a steam-engine, and applied it to the drainage of mines. His inven¬ tion included the two capital properties of steam, its power of producing a vacuum by condensation, and its elastic force at high temperatures. A few years later the piston-foi'm was introduced or re-invented by Newcomen and Cawley, as well as the valuable expedient of producing condensation by a squirt of cold w7ater injected into the cylinder; and in this condition the Atmospheric Engine remained w'ith slight improvement for above half a century, doing the work for which it was invented,—the pumping of water out of shafts (the pump being moved by a chain attached to the end of a horizontal oscillating beam),—wherever economy of fuel was unimportant",Worcester,ZA,8,South Africa,Africa
"(324.) In the Cornish engine we see the Energy of Heat Their per- ren(jereq available to an extent which the inventor fection. .. , himselt would at one time have thought scarcely cre¬ dible. The combustion of a bushel of coal which in a Newcomen’s engine improved by Smeaton was capable of raising 3,000,000 pounds through one foot, in Watt’s improved pumping engine raised 20,000,000 pounds the same height. But by the indefatigable skill and perseverance of engineers the Cornish pumps now yield at least five times the last amount. This, however, is not the place to enter upon these details, nor can we stop to particularize the other and various mechanical inventions intro¬ duced by Watt in the form of valves, governors, and steam-indicators. Still less can we enlarge upon the endless and still multiplying applications of this ad¬ mirable moving power, which is as capable of super¬ seding the greatest natural forces hitherto applied by man to the useful arts, as it is adapted by its easy regulation to replace human industry in the most delicate operations; “ the trunk of an elephant, which can pick up a pin or rend an oak, is as nothing to it.”2 Of the applications of the steam-engine with which (325.) Mr Watt was less immediately connected, its adap- tation to locomotion in the case of ships in the last steam to century, and in that of railway trains in the present, navigation, have been the most striking, and fraught with con¬ sequences the most important to mankind. Of the latter we shall have occasion to speak in a future section ; of the origin of steam navigation we may here say a very few words. Passing over projects which never were realized, of moving barges by steam, or other inanimate power, against wind and tide,— such as those of Worcester, Papin, and Hulls,—wre find that the first experiment entitled to be called successful was made by Mr Miller of Dalswinton in Miller— Scotland, conjointly -with Mr James Taylor, tutor in Taylor- his family, who together formed the project of mov¬ ing vessels by means of paddle-wheels driven by a steam-engine, and realized it with the aid of Sym¬ ington, a practical engineer. As we shall also find in the case of steam-carriages, the idea of the applica¬ tion of the steam-engine to move ships was already a familiar one to the minds of many persons about the middle of the last century. To put it in practice with advantage was the step required. Mr Miller’s first boat was launched on Dalswinton Loch in Dum¬ friesshire, in October 1788, and attained a speed of five miles an hour. The subject was pursued by Symington and others. In 1789 a larger vessel was propelled on the Forth and Clyde Canal. Subse¬ quently, however, the invention languished. The want of co-operation, of capital, and ingenuity, na¬ turally extinguishes many valuable inventions. Watt himself was only rescued from the same difficulty by the unusual intelligence of Boulton and Small, his coadjutors at Birmingham. Symington was less for¬ tunate, as well as probably less meritorious ; and though it is well established that Fulton, who passes on the other side of the Atlantic for the inventor of steam-ships, had seen the relics of Symington’s second experiment, we must do the Americans the justice to say that the application of steam to navigation first flourished in the United States. In 1807 Fulton Fulton, started a river boat with an engine of Boulton and Watt. In 1813 the example was tardily imitated on the Firth of Clyde. The subsequent improvements need not here be specified. They have been very great and striking, but with the exception of the recent substitution of the screw-propeller for paddle-wheels, they scarcely involve any new principles.3 We may briefly close what we have to say of Mr (326.) Watt personally. His health was feeble from child- ^ar°eter hood, but being blessed with much calmness of tern- 0f Watt, per he prolonged his life to a great age, and passed through its struggles, though they were to him con- 1 The double-acting engine was planned in 1774 or 1775.

His father was either a com¬ mon pitman or otherwise employed about the collier¬ ies of the district, and young Stephenson, without any advantages of education, began to labour for his bread at an early age. His work appears to have been always connected with the machinery of the pits above ground, and not with their excavation. Thus he rose gradually to be an engine-man at the wages of twelve shillings a week. This was at Killingworth near Newcastle, where he showed considerable me¬ chanical ingenuity, and gradually gained the confi¬ dence of his employers. Having married in 1802, he had a son born the following year, the present Mr Robert Stephenson, M.P., whom he brought up with the tenderest care, and whom he ever and justly regarded with a father’s pride. In order to bestow upon him the advantage of that education of which he had himself felt the want, it is stated that he made money at extra hours by mending his neighbours’ clocks and watches, and finally, in more prosperous days, sent his son to complete his education at the University of Edinburgh. George Stephenson never acquired much book-learning himself, but by natural sagacity and observation he attained to a sound knowledge of mechanical principles. We do not claim for him, however, the character of great inven¬ tiveness. His skill rather lay in perceiving how far methods and contrivances already known might be pushed to an advantageous result. He possessed that shrewd decision which ingenious persons often want, enabling him to detect what is truly valuable in the numerous mechanical schemes which at any time are afloat, and to devise the means of realizing them. He also possessed that confidence in his own judgment which is necessary to carry out principles to their legitimate extent, but from which feebler or less practical minds usually shrink","Newcastle, Newcastle, University, Edinburgh","ZA,US,GB",8,"South Africa,United States,United Kingdom","Africa,North America,Europe"
"Like Watt and all other innovators, his great diffi¬ culty was to get the machinery of his locomotives pro¬ perly made, and the great railway movement of 1825 was anticipated by the establishment in 1820 of an engine factory at Newcastle, which, till after the (399.) opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1831, remained the only one, and for long afterwards the best of its class. The cranked axle contrived by Trevithick, and abandoned because it could not be properly welded, was now restored; the heavy loco¬ motive was placed on strong but easy steel springs, wrought iron was skilfully introduced into the wheels of the carriages, and the whole machinery was made to work with precision, and to combine a degree of resistance never before anticipated with comparative lightness. The factory was established in 1821, and the first passenger locomotive was started on the Dar¬ lington and Stockton Railway in 1825","Newcastle, Liverpool","ZA,GB",8,"South Africa,United Kingdom","Africa,Europe"
"With respect to the Railway, he had long decided in his own mind against the use of steam-carriages on common roads. This conclusion was scientifically based on his own experiments on the friction of wag¬ gons on railways made in conjunction with Mr Ni¬ cholas Wood, civil engineer at Newcastle, as far back as the years 1815 and 1816. A simple dynamometer Stephen- of Stephenson’s invention was used, and by means of^n's^pe- it the two fundamental propositions were established, the frjctjon that the friction is directly as the pressure, and that it0f trains, is quite independent of velocity (at least when the speed was moderate). It may be said that these proposi¬ tions were already known; but, besides that probably Stephenson and Wood were equally unacquainted with the writings of Coulomb, they could not have 1 I have found many curious details of the early history of railways in a series of articles on the life of George Stephenson in the Civil Engineer Journal for 1848 and 1849.

"They are characterized by directness of purpose and a consummate command of ordinary mathematics, unaccompanied by any pretension to symbolical dis¬ play ;—it might be added too, by the obscure concise¬ ness of Dr Young’s habitual style.

"It was several years later that Malus directed his (477.) attention to the subject, unaware of what had been accomplished by Wollaston. He had returned in 1801 from the unfortunate French expedition to Egypt, where he was engaged as an officer of en¬ gineers, and had ruined his health through fatigue and the insalubrity of the climate. He was an ac¬ complished mathematician, having acted as professor both at the Polytechnic School and that of Metz, and was of course a member of the Institute of Cairo","Metz, Cairo","EG,FR",8,"Egypt,France","Africa,Europe"
"On his return to France, during the intervals of his military duties, he occupied himself in the composi¬ tion of an elaborate analytical treatise on optics, which had already occupied his attention in Egypt. This led him to the subject of double refraction, and he verified by numerous experiments the accuracy of Huygens’ law. La Place wrote a paper on the mathe¬ matical law of the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in which he introduced the idea of a repulsive force emanating from the axis of the crystal; but it may be truly affirmed that the notion of a spheroidal un¬ dulation so happily introduced by Huygens is the only one which really fits the case; and by the very impossibility of expressing the facts intelligibly with¬ out it, gives an undisputed advantage to that theory",,"FR,EG",8,"France,Egypt","Europe,Africa"

The decla¬ ration of war against France rendered his stay either in Valentia or in the Balearic Isles impossible, and he was conveyed in disguise from Majorca to Algiers, whence he twice essayed to reach Marseilles, but was once driven back to Africa by a storm, once made prisoner by a Spanish corsair. After great suffering, he at length reached France in July 1809, carrying with him the precious record of his geodeti¬ cal operations. From this time his promotion was assured, and his life became tranquil and inactive, al¬ though the deep attachment which he formed with Baron Humboldt immediately on his return to France would probably have induced him to accompany that enterprising traveller to Central Asia, had that jour¬ ney ever been accomplished. At the early age of 23 Arago attained the position of Member of the Insti¬ tute, and was again attached to the Paris Observa¬ tory, of which at a later period he became director",Algiers,"FR,ES,DZ",8,"France,Spain,Algeria","Europe,Europe,Africa"
"One of the circumstances which most contributed to encourage Mr Leslie’s taste for experiment, was his engagement for above two years as tutor and companion in the family of the ingenious Mr Wedg¬ wood. Another was the opportunities which he found or made for himself of foreign travel. With or without companions he visited, in the early period of his career, America, and most of the northern countries of Europe, particularly Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway. He also medi¬ tated a journey to Egypt and the East, a project reluctantly abandoned, and to which he reverted even in the last years of his life ; but it was never carried into effect. Nothing, perhaps, fosters so surely a taste for science as such extended tours ; and the acquaintance made under the most agreeable cir¬ cumstances with foreign philosophers, and the fami¬ liarity gained with their language and experiments, contributes to it in no small degree",Holland,"DE,CH,SE,NO,EG,US",8,"Germany,Switzerland,Sweden,Norway,Egypt,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Africa,North America"

"2 I ought to mention that the practical introduction of the electric telegraph in England is in no small degree due to the energy of Mr Fothergill Cooke, joint patentee with Mr Wheatstone for the invention. The question of the respective shares of these gentlemen in the merit of telegraphic communication was submitted, in 1841, to the arbitration of Sir Marc Brunei and the late Mr Daniell, the result of which appears to leave the preponderance of merit in some respects ambiguous ; neverthe¬ less, in a history of Science, Mr Wheatstone is clearly entitled to the pre-eminent place. Several pamphlets have also been sub¬ sequently published by the parties.

"To Major-General Edward Sabine, of the Royal Artillery, is mainly due the judicious management of these magnetic explorations, and the speedy and skilful publication of their interesting results. During the course of an active life he has enjoyed opportunities of making extensive observations with magnetic ap¬ paratus and with the pendulum (238) throughout a great range of latitude. His experiments (carried on principally between the years 1819 and 1826) were made in Brazil, the coast of Guinea, Spitzbergen, and Arctic America. His observations on magnetic inten¬ sity are particularly valuable, and first indicated the position of a region of maximum intensity in North America considerably to the south of the magnetic pole as indicated by the dipping needle.
