"to the origin and genesis of our ideas, to trace the causes to which the sciences owe their birth; and to mark the characteristics hy which they are distinguished from each other. In order to ascertain the latter, it is necessary to compre¬ hend, in one general scheme, all the various de¬ partments of study; to arrange them into pro¬ per classes; and to point out their mutual rela¬ tions and dependencies.” Such a scheme is some¬ times likened hy D’Alembert to a map or chart of the intellectual world; sometimes to a Ge¬ nealogical1 or Encyclopedical Tree, indicating the manifold and complicated affinities of those studies, which, however apparently remote and unconnected, are all the common offspring of the human understanding. For executing suc¬ cessfully this chart or tree, a philosophical deli¬ neation of the natural progress of the mind may (according to him) furnish very useful lights; although he acknowledges that the results of the two undertakings cannot fail to differ widely in many instances,—the laws which regulate the generation of our ideas often interfering with that systematical order in the relative arrange¬ ment of scientific pursuits, which it is the pur¬ pose of the Encyclopedical Tree to exhibit.2 In treating of the first of these subjects, it can¬ not he denied that D’Alembert has displayed much ingenuity and invention; hut the depth and solidity of his general train of thought may he questioned. On various occasions, he has evidently suffered himself to he misled hy a spi¬ rit of false refinement; and on others, where probably he was fully aware of his inability to render the theoretical chain complete, he seems to have aimed at concealing from his readers the faulty links, hy availing himself of those epi¬ grammatic points, and other artifices of style, with which the genius of the French language enables a skilful writer to smooth and varnish over his most illogical transitions",,FR,8,France,Europe
"things as they are in themselves knowahle; actions as they depend on us, in order to hap¬ piness ; and the right use of signs, in order to knowledge; being toto ccelo different, they seem¬ ed to me to he the three great provinces of the intellectual world, wholly separate and distinct one from another.”1 From the manner in which Mr Locke ex¬ presses himself in the above quotation, he ap¬ pears evidently to have considered the division proposed in it as an original idea of his own; and yet the truth is, that it coincides exactly with what was generally adopted by the philo¬ sophers of ancient Greece. “ The ancient Greek Philosophy,” says Mr Smith, “ was divid¬ ed into three great branches, Physics, or Natural Philosophy; Ethics, or Moral Philosophy; and Logic. This general division,” he adds, “ seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.” Mr Smith afterwards observes, in strict conformity to Locke’s definitions (of which, however, he seems to have had no recollection when he wrote this passage), “ That, as the human mind and the Deity, in whatever their essence may he supposed to consist, are parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too, productive of the most important effects, what¬ ever was taught in the ancient schools of Greece, concerning their nature, made a part of the sys¬ tem of physics.”2 * Dr Campbell, in his Philosophy of Rhetoric has borrowed from the Grecian schools the same very extensive use of the words physics and physiology, which he employs as synonymous terms; comprehending under this title “ not merely Natural History, Astronomy, Geography, Mechanics, Optics, Hydrostatics, Meteorology, Medicine, Chemistry, hut also Natural Theology and Psychology, which,” he observes, “ have been, in his opinion, most unnaturally disjoined from Physiology by philosophers.” “ Spirit,” he adds, “ which here comprises only the Supreme Being and the human soul, is surely as much in¬ cluded under the notion of natural object as body is; and is knowahle to the philosopher purely in the same way, by observation and experience.”5 A similar train of thinking led the late cele¬ brated M. Turgot to comprehend under the name of Physics, not only Natural Philosophy (as that phrase is understood by the Newtonians), but Metaphysics, Logic, and even History.4 Notwithstanding all this weight of authority, it is difficult to reconcile one’s self to an arrange¬ ment which, while it classes with Astronomy, with Mechanics, with Optics, and with Hy¬ drostatics, the strikingly contrasted studies of Natural Theology and of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, disunites from the two last the far more congenial sciences of Ethics and of Logic. The human mind, it is true, as well as the material world which surrounds it, forms a part of the great system of the Universe; hut is it possible to conceive two parts of the same whole more completely dissimilar, or rather more diametrically opposite, in all their charac- teristical attributes ? Is not the one the appro¬ priate field and province of observation,—a power 1 See the concluding chapter of the Essay on Human Understanding, entitled, “ Of the Division of the Sciences.” J Wealth of Nations, Book v. chap. i",Of,"GR,TR",8,"Greece,Turkey","Europe,Asia"

"It would furnish a very interesting and in¬ structive subject of speculation, to record and to illustrate (with the spirit, however, rather of a philosopher than of an antiquary), the various abortive efforts, which, during this protracted and seemingly hopeless period of a thousand years, were made by enlightened individuals, to impart to their contemporaries the fruits of their own acquirements. For in no one age from its commencement to its close, does the continuity of knowledge (if I may borrow an expression of Mr Harris), seem to have been entirely interrupted: “ There was always a faint twilight, like that auspicious gleam which, in a summer’s night, fills up the interval between the setting and the rising sun.”1 On the present occasion, I shall content myself with remarking the important effects produced by the numerous monastic esta¬ blishments all over the Christian world, in pre¬ serving, amidst the general wreck, the inesti¬ mable remains of Greek and Roman refinement, and in keeping alive, during so many centuries, those scattered sparks of truth and of science, which were afterwards to kindle into so bright a flame. I mention this particularly, because, in our zeal against the vices and corruptions of the Romish church, we are too apt to forget, how deeply wre are indebted to its superstitious and apparently useless foundations, for the most pre¬ cious advantages that we now enjoy",Roman,"RO,GR",8,"Romania,Greece","Europe,Europe"

In con¬ sequence of this event, a number of learned Greeks took refuge in Italy, where the taste for literature already introduced by Dante, Petrarch, and Boccacio, together with the liberal patro¬ nage of the illustrious House of Medicis, secu¬ red them a welcome reception. A knowledge of the Greek tongue soon became fashionable; and the learned, encouraged by the rapid diffusion which the art of printing now gave to their labours, vied with each other in rendering the Greek authors accessible, by means of Latin translations, to a still wider circle of readers",,"GR,IT",8,"Greece,Italy","Europe,Europe"

"Without this emancipation of the lower or¬ ders, and the gradual diffusion of wealth by which it was accompanied, the advantages de¬ rived from the invention of printing would have been extremely limited. A certain degree of ease and independence is essentially requisite to inspire men with the desire of knowledge, and to afford the leisure necessary for acquiring it; and it is only by the encouragement which such a state of society presents to industry and ambi¬ tion, that the selfish passions of the multitude can be interested in the intellectual improve¬ ment of their children. It is only, too, in such a state of society, that education and books are likely to increase the sum of human happiness; for while these advantages are confined to one privileged description of individuals, they but furnish them with an additional engine for de¬ basing and misleading the minds of their infe¬ riors. To all which it may be added, that it is chiefly by the shock and collision of different and opposite prejudices, that truths are gradually cleared from that admixture of error which they have so strong a tendency to acquire, wherever the course of public opinion is forcibly con- 1 It was in consequence of this mode of conducting education by means of oral instruction alone, that the different sects of philosophy arose in ancient Greece; and it seems to have been with a view of counteracting the obvious inconveniences resulting from them, that Socrates introduced his peculiar method of questioning, with an air of sceptical diffidence, those whom he was anxious to instruct; so as to allow them, in forming their conclusions, the complete and unbiassed exercise of their own reason. Such, at least, is the apology offered for the apparent indecision of the Academic school, by one of its wisest as well as most eloquent adherents. “ As for other sects,” says Cicero, “ who are bound in fetters, before they are able to form any judgment of what is right or true, and who have been led to yield themselves up, in their tender years, to the guidance of some friend, or to the captivating eloquence of the teacher whom they have first heard, they as¬ sume to themselves the right of pronouncing upon questions of which they are completely ignorant; adhering to whatever creed the wind of doctrine may have driven them, as if it were the only rock on which their safety depended.”—Cic",Cicero,"GR,US",8,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"Nor ought we here to overlook the influence of the foregoing causes, in encouraging among authors the practice of addressing the multitude in their own vernacular tongues. The zeal of the Reformers first gave birth to this invaluable innovation, and imposed on their adversaries the necessity of employing, in their own de¬ fence, the same weapons.1 2 From that moment the prejudice began to vanish which had so long confounded knowledge with erudition; and a revolution commenced in the republic of let¬ ters, analogous to what the invention of gun¬ powder produced in the art of war. “ All the splendid distinctions of mankind,” as the Cham¬ pion and Flower of Chivalry indignantly ex¬ claimed, <{ were thereby thrown down; and the naked shepherd levelled with the knight clad in steel.” To all these considerations may he added the gradual effects of time and experience in cor¬ recting the errors and prejudices which had misled philosophers during so long a succession of ages. To this cause, chiefly, must he ascrib¬ ed the ardour with which we find various inge¬ nious men, soon after the period in question, employed in prosecuting experimental inquiries ; a species of study to which nothing analogous occurs in the history of ancient science.3 * The boldest and most successful of this new school was the celebrated Paracelsus, born in 1493, and consequently only ten years younger than Luther. “ It is impossible to doubt,” says Le Clerc, in his History of Physic, “ that he pos¬ sessed an extensive knowledge of what is called the Materia Medica, and that he had employed much time in working on the animal, the vege¬ table, and the mineral substances of which it is composed. He seems, besides, to have tried an immense number of experiments in chemistry; hut he has this great defect, that he studiously conceals or disguises the results of his long ex¬ perience.” The same author quotes from Pa¬ racelsus a remarkable expression, in which he calls the philosophy of Aristotle a wooden foun¬ dation. “ He ought to have attempted,” con¬ tinues Le Clerc, “ to have laid a better ; hut if he has not done it, he has at least, hy discover¬ ing its weakness, invited his successors to look out for a firmer basis.”5 Lord Bacon himself, while he censures the moral frailties of Paracelsus, and the blind em¬ piricism of his followers, indirectly acknowledges the extent of his experimental information: “ The ancient sophists may he said to have hid, hut Paracelsus extinguished the light of nature",Cham,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"The sophists were only deserters of experience, hut Paracelsus has betrayed it. At the same time, he is so far from understanding the right method of conducting experiments, or of record¬ ing their results, that he has added to the trouble and tediousness of experimenting. By wander¬ ing through the wilds of experience, his disciples sometimes stumble upon useful discoveries, not hy reason, but by accident;—whence rashly proceeding to form theories, they carry the smoke and tarnish of their art along with them; and, like childish operators at the furnace, at¬ tempt to raise a structure of philosophy with a few experiments of distillation.” Two other circumstances, of a nature widely different from those hitherto enumerated, al¬ though, probably, in no small degree to be ac¬ counted for on the same principles, seconded, with an incalculable accession of power, the sud- 1 “ The sacred books were, in almost all the kingdoms and states of Europe, translated into the language of each respec¬ tive people, particularly in Germany, Italy, France, and Britain.”—(Mosheim’s Eccles. IJist. Voh III. p. 205.) The effect of this single circumstance in multiplying the number of readers and of thinkers, and in giving a certain stability to the mutable forms of oral speech, may be easily imagined. The common translation of the Bible into English is pronounced by Dr Lowth to be still the best standard of our language. . „ 2 “ Hmc nostra (ut ssepe diximus) felicitatis cujusdam sunt potius quam facultatis, et potius temporis partus qua?n ingenn. — Nov.

"Mosheim, after remarking that “ there are more excellent rules of conduct in the few practical productions of Luther and Melanchthon, than are to be found in the innumerable volumes of all the ancient casuists and moralisers,” candidly ac¬ knowledges, “ that the notions of these great men concerning the important science of morality were far from being suffi¬ ciently accurate or extensive. Melanchthon himself, whose exquisite judgment rendered him peculiarly capable of re¬ ducing into a compendious system the elements of every science, never seems to have thought of treating morals in this manner ; but has inserted, on the contrary, all his practical rules and instructions, under the theological articles that relate to the law, sin, free-will, faith, hope, and charity.”—Mosheim’s Eccles. Hist. Vol. IV. pp. 23. 24",Eccles,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"The founder of this new sect, or, to speak more correctly, the systematizer and apostle of its doctrines, was born as early as 1469, that is, about ten years before Luther; and, like that reformer, acquired, by the commanding superio¬ rity of his genius, an astonishing ascendant, though of a very different nature, over the minds of his followers. No writer, certainly, either in ancient or in modern times, has ever united, in a more remarkable degree, a greater variety of the most dissimilar and seemingly the most discordant gifts and attainments;—a profound acquaintance with all those arts of dis¬ simulation and intrigue, which in the petty cabinets of Italy, were then universally con¬ founded with political wisdom; an imagination familiarized to the cool contemplation of what¬ ever is perfidious or atrocious in the history of conspirators and of tyrants; combined with a graphical skill in holding up to laughter the comparatively harmless follies of ordinary life",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"The consequences of the prevalence of such a creed among the rulers of mankind were such as might he expected. “ Infamous crimes, as¬ sassinations, and poisonings (says a French his¬ torian), prevailed more than ever. They were thought to he the growth of Italy, where the rage and weakness of the opposite factions con¬ spired to multiply them. Morality gradually disappeared, and with it all security in the inter¬ course of life. The first principles of duty were obliterated by the joint influence of atheism and of superstition.”1 And here, may I he permitted to caution my readers against the common error of confound¬ ing the double doctrine of Machiavelian politi¬ cians, with the benevolent reverence for establish¬ ed opinions, manifested in the noted maxim of Fontenelle,—“ that a wise man, even when his hand was full of truths, would often content himself with opening his little finger.” Of the advocates for the former, it may he justly said, that “ they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil;” well knowing, if I may borrow the words of Bacon, “ that the open day-light doth not show the masks and mummeries, and triumphs of the world, half so stately as candle-light.” The philosopher, on the other hand, who is duly impressed with the latter, may be compared to the oculist, who, after removing the cataract of his patient, pre¬ pares the still irritable eye, by the glimmering dawn of a darkened apartment, for enjoying in safety the light of day.® Machiavel is well known to have been, at bottom, no friend to the priesthood; and his character has been stigmatized by many of the order with the most opprobrious epithets. It is nevertheless certain, that to his maxims the royal defenders of the Catholic faith have been indebted for the spirit of that policy which they have uniformly opposed to the innovations of the Reformers. The Prince was a favourite book of the Emperor Charles V.; and was called the Bible of Catharine of Medicis. At the court of the latter, while Regent of France, those who approached her are said to have professed open- 1 Millot",Of,"FR,IT,TR",8,"France,Italy,Turkey","Europe,Europe,Asia"
"ly its most atrocious maxims ; particularly that which recommends to sovereigns not to commit crimes by halves. The Italian cardinals, who are supposed to have been the secret instigators of the massacre of St Bartholomew, were bred in the same school.1 It is observed by Mr Hume, that <£ there is scarcely any maxim in the Prince, which subse¬ quent experience has not entirely refuted.” “ Machiavel,” says the same writer, 44 was cer¬ tainly a great genius ; but having confined his study to the furious and tyrannical governments of ancient times, or to the little disorderly prin¬ cipalities of Italy, his reasonings, especially upon monarchical governments, have been found ex¬ tremely defective. The errors of this politician proceeded, in a great measure, from his having lived in too early an age of the world, to be a good judge of political truth.”4 To these very judicious remarks, it may he added, that the bent of Machiavel’s mind seems to have disposed him much more strongly to combine and to generalize his historical reading, than to remount to the first principles of politi¬ cal science, in the constitution of human nature, and in the immutable truths of morality. His conclusions, accordingly, ingenious and refined as they commonly are, amount to little more (with a few very splendid exceptions) than em¬ pirical results from the events of past ages. To the student of ancient history they may he often both interesting and instructive; but, to the modern politician, the most important lesson they afford is, the danger, in the present circum¬ stances of the world, of trusting to such re¬ sults, as maxims of universal application, or of permanent utility",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"The progress of political philosophy, and along with it of morality and good order, in every part of Europe, since the period of which I am now speaking, forms so pleasing a comment on the profligate and short-sighted policy of Ma¬ chiavel, that I cannot help pausing for a mo¬ ment to remark the fact. In stating it, I shall avail myself of the words of the same profound writer, whose strictures on Machiavel’s Prince I had already occasion to quote. 44 Though ad kinds of government,” says Mr Hume, 44 he im¬ proved in modern times, yet monarchical govern¬ ment seems to have made the greatest advances towards perfection. It may now he affirmed of civilized monarchies, what was formerly said of republics alone, that they are a government of laws, not of men. They are found susceptible of order, method, and constancy, to a surprising degree. Property is there secure, industry en¬ couraged, the arts flourish, and the prince lives secure among his subjects, like a father among his children. There are, perhaps, and have been for two centuries, near two hundred absolute princes, great and small, in Europe; and allow¬ ing twenty years to each reign, we may suppose that there have been in the whole two thousand monarchs, or tyrants, as the Greeks would have called them. Yet of these there has not been one, not even Philip II. of Spain, so had as Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, or Domitian, who were four in twelve among the Roman Emperors.”5 For this very remarkable fact, it seems diffi¬ cult to assign any cause equal to the effect, but the increased diffusion of knowledge (imperfect, alas ! as this diffusion still is) by means of the Press; which, while it has raised, in free states, a growing bulwark against the oppression of rulers, in the light and spirit of the people, has, even under the most absolute governments, had a powerful influence—by teaching princes to re¬ gard the wealth and prosperity and instruction of their subjects as the firmest basis of their gran¬ deur—in directing their attention to objects of national and permanent utility. How encoura¬ ging the prospect thus opened of the future his¬ tory of the world ! And what a motive to ani¬ mate the ambition of those, who, in the solitude of the closet, aspire to bequeath their contribu¬ tions, how slender soever, to the progressive mass of human improvement and happiness ! In the bright constellation of scholars, histo¬ rians, artists, and wits, who shed so strong a lustre on Italy during that splendid period of its history which commences with the revival of 1 Voltaire, Essay on Universal History",,ES,8,Spain,Europe
"Not that Italy was then destitute of writers who pretended to the character of philosophers; hut as their attempts were, in general, limited to the exclusive illustration and defence of some one or other of the ancient systems for which they had conceived a predilection, they added but little of their own to the stock of useful know¬ ledge, and are now remembered chiefly from the occasional recurrence of their names in the catalogues of the curious, or in the works of philological erudition. The zeal of Cardinal Bessarion, and of Marsilius Ficinus, for the re¬ vival of the Platonic philosophy, was more pe¬ culiarly remarkable, and, at one time, produced so general an impression, as to alarm the follow¬ ers of Aristotle for the tottering authority of their master. If we may credit Launoius, this great revolution was on the point of being ac¬ tually accomplished, when Cardinal Bellarmine warned Pope Clement VIII. of the peculiar dan¬ ger of showing any favour to a philosopher whose opinions approached so nearly as those of Plato to the truths revealed in the Gospel",Plato,"IT,CO",8,"Italy,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"By a small band of bolder innovators belong¬ ing to this golden age of Italian literature, the Aristotelian doctrines were more directly and powerfully assailed. Laurentius Valla, Marius Nizolius, and Franciscus Patricius,1 2 have all of them transmitted their names to posterity as philosophical reformers, and, in particular, as revolters against the authority of the Stagirite",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"At the same period with Franciscus Patricius, flourished another learned Italian, Albericus Gentilis, whose writings seem to have attracted more notice in England and Germany than in his own country. His attachment to the reform¬ ed faith having driven him from Italy, he sought an asylum at Oxford, where, in 1587, he was ap¬ pointed professor of the Civil Law, an office which he held till the period of his death in 1611.3 He was the author of a treatise De Jure Belli, in three books, which appeared successively in 1588 and 1589, and were first published to¬ gether at Hanau in 1598. His name, however, has already sunk into almost total oblivion; and I should certainly not have mentioned it on the present occasion? were it not for his indisputable merits as the precursor of Grotius, in a depart¬ ment of study which, forty years afterwards, the celebrated treatise De Jure Belli et Pads was 1 His Discussion.es Peripateticoe were printed at Venice in 1571. Another work, entitled Novade Universis Philosophia, also printed at Venice, appeared in 1593.

Hist. Lib. cxix. xvii.).

"to raise to so conspicuous a rank among the branches of academical education. The avowed aim of this new science, when combined with the anxiety of Gentilis to counteract the effect of Machiavel’s Prince, by representing it as a warning to subjects rather than as a manual of instruction for their rulers, may he regarded as satisfactory evidence of the growing influence, even at that era, of better ethical principles than those commonly imputed to the Florentine Secre¬ tary. 1 The only other Italian of whom I shall take notice at present, is Campanella;2 * a philoso¬ pher now remembered chiefly in consequence of his eccentric character and eventful life, but of whom Leibnitz has spoken in terms of such high admiration, as to place him in the same line with Bacon. After looking into several of his works with some attention, I must confess I am at a loss to conceive upon what grounds the eulogy of Leibnitz proceeds; but as it is difficult to suppose, that the praise of this great man was, in any instance, the result of mere caprice, I shall put it in the power of my read¬ ers to judge for themselves, by subjoining a faithful translation of his words. I do this the more willingly, as the passage itself (whatever may be thought of the critical judgments pro¬ nounced in it), contains some general remarks on intellectual character, which are in every re¬ spect worthy of the author",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"“ Some men, in conducting operations where an attention to minutiae is requisite, discover a mind vigorous, subtile, and versatile, and seem to be equal to any undertaking, how arduous soever. But when they are called upon to act on a greater scale, they hesitate and are lost in their own meditations ; distrustful of their judg¬ ment, and conscious of their incompetency to the scene in which they are placed: men, in a word, possessed of a genius rather acute than comprehensive. A similar difference may be traced among authors. What can be more acute than Descartes in Physics, or than Hohhes in Morals ! And yet, if the one be compa¬ red with Bacon, and the other with Campa¬ nella, the former writers seem to grovel upon the earth,—the latter to soar to the Heavens, by the vastness of their conceptions, their plans, and their enterprises, and to aim at objects be¬ yond the reach of the human powers. The former, accordingly, are best fitted for deliver¬ ing the first elements of knowledge, the latter for establishing conclusions of important and general application.”5 The annals of France, during this period, present very scanty materials for the History of Philosophy. The name of the Chancellor de 1’Hopital, however, must not be passed over in silence. As an author, he does not rank high; nor does he seem to have at all valued himself on the careless effusions of his literary hours; but, as an upright and virtuous magis¬ trate, he has left behind him a reputation un¬ rivalled to this day.4 His wise and indulgent principles on the subject of religious liberty, and the steadiness with which he adhered to them, under circumstances of extraordinary dif¬ ficulty and danger, exhibit a splendid contrast to the cruel intolerance, which, a few years be- 1 The claims of Albericus Gentilis to be regarded as the father of Natural Jurisprudence, are strongly asserted by his countryman Lampredi, in his very judicious and elegant work, entitled, Juris Publici Theoremata, published at Pisa in 1782. “ Hie primus jus'aliquod Belli et esse et tradi posse excogitavit, et Belli et Pads regulas explanavit primus, et fortasse in causa fuit cur Grotius opus suum conscribere aggrederetur: dignus sane qui prae ceteris memoretur, Italiae enim, in qua ortus erat, et unde Juris Romani disciplinam hauserat, gloriam auxit, effecitque ut quae fuerat bonarum arti- um omnium restitutrix et altrix, eadem esset et prima Jurisprudentiae Naturalis magistra.” 2 Born 1568, died 1639","Pisa, Born","FR,IT,NL",8,"France,Italy,Netherlands","Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Contemporary with these great men was Bo- din (or Bodinus),8 an eminent French lawyer, who appears to have been one of the first that united a philosophical turn of thinking with an extensive knowledge of jurisprudence and of history. His learning is often ill digested, and his conclusions still oftener rash and unsound; yet it is hut justice to him to acknowledge, that, in his views of the philosophy of law, he has approached very nearly to some leading ideas of Lord Bacon;3 while, in his refined combina¬ tions of historical facts, he has more than once struck into a train of speculation, hearing a strong resemblance to that afterwards pursued by Montesquieu.4 Of this resemblance, so re¬ markable an instance occurs in his chapter on the moral effects of Climate, and on the atten¬ tion due to this circumstance by the legislator, that it has repeatedly subjected the author of The Spirit of Laws (but in my opinion without any good reason) to the imputation of plagia¬ rism.5 A resemblance to Montesquieu, still more honourable to Bodinus, may be traced in their common attachment to religious as well as to civil liberty. To have caught, in the six¬ teenth century, somewhat of the philosophical spirit of the eighteenth, reflects less credit on the force of his mind, than to have imbibed, in the midst of the theological controversies of his age, those lessons of mutual forbearance and charity, which a long and sad experience of the fatal effects of persecution has to this day so im¬ perfectly taught to the most enlightened nations of Europe",Of,"TR,FR",8,"Turkey,France","Asia,Europe"
"As a specimen of the liberal and moderate views of this philosophical politician, I shall quote two short passages from his Treatise De la Republique, which seem to me objects of con¬ siderable curiosity, when contrasted with the general spirit of the age in which they were written. The first relates to liberty of con¬ science, for which he was a strenuous and in¬ trepid advocate, not only in his publications, but as a member of the Etals Generaux, assembled at Blois in 1576. <£ The mightier that a man is (says Bodin), the more justly and temperate¬ ly he ought to behave himself towards all men, but especially towards his subjects. Wherefore the senate and people of Basil did wisely, who, having renounced the Bishop of Rome’s religion, would not, upon the sudden, thrust the monks and nuns, with the other religious persons, out of their abbeys and monasteries, but only took order, that, as they died they should die both for themselves and their successors, expressly for¬ bidding any new to be chosen in their places, so that, by that means, their colleges might, by 1 “ One cannot help admiring,” says Dr Jortin, “ the decent manner in which the illustrious Thuanus hath spoken ot Calvin “ Acri vir ac vehementi ingenio, et admirabili facundia prseditus; turn inter protestantes magni nominis theolo- gus.”—(Life of Erasmus, p. 555.)

In 1606, the treatise of The Republic was done inlo English by Kichard Knolles, who appears to have collated the French and Latin copies so carefully and judiciously, that his version is, in some respects, superior to either of the originals. It is from this version, accordingly, that I have transenbed the passages above quoted ; trusting, that it will not be unacceptable to my readers, while looking back to the intellectual attainments o our forefathers, to have an opportunity, at the same time, of marking the progress which had been made in England, moie t tan two centuries ago, in the arts of writing and of translation. _ _ „ at io'i For Dr Johnson’s opinion of Knolles’s merits as an historian, and as an English writer, see the Rambler, ^o. i&s","University, Cambridge, London, Johnson","US,UK,GB,FR",8,"United States,N/A,United Kingdom,France","North America,N/A,Europe,Europe"

"The dialogue of our illustrious countryman Buchanan, De Jure Regni apud Scotos, though occasionally disfigured by the keen and indig¬ nant temper of the writer, and by a predilection (pardonable in a scholar warm from the schools of ancient Greece and Rome) for forms of policy unsuitable to the circumstances of modern Europe, bears, nevertheless, in its general spirit, a closer resemblance to the political philosophy of the eighteenth century, than any composition which had previously appeared. The ethical paradoxes afterwards inculcated by Hobbes as the ground-work of his slavish theory of govern¬ ment, are anticipated and refuted, and a power¬ ful argument is urged against that doctrine of Utility which has attracted so much notice in our times. The political reflections, too, inci¬ dentally introduced by the same author in his History of Scotland, bear marks of a mind worthy of a better age than fell to his lot.

"The merits of Bacon, as the father of Experi¬ mental Philosophy, are so universally acknow¬ ledged, that it would be superfluous to touch upon them here. The lights which he has struck out m various branches of the Philosophy of Mind, have been much less attended to; al¬ though the whole scope and tenor of his specu¬ lations show, that to this study his genius was far more strongly and happily turned, than to that of the Material World. It was not, as some seem to have imagined, by sagacious anticipa¬ tions of particular discoveries afterwards to be made in physics, that his writings have had so powerful an influence in accelerating the ad¬ vancement of that science. In the extent and accuracy of his physical knowledge, he was far inferior to many of his predecessors; but he surpassed them all in his knowledge of the laws, the resources, and the limits of the human un¬ derstanding. The sanguine expectations with which he looked forwards to the future, were founded solely on his confidence in the untried capacities of the mind, and on a conviction of the possibility of invigorating and guiding, by means of logical rules, those faculties which, in all our researches after truth, are the organs or instruments to be employed. “ Such rules,” as he himself has observed, <c do in some sort equal men’s wits, and leave no great advantage or pre¬ eminence to the perfect and excellent motions of the spirit. To draw a straight line, or to de¬ scribe a circle, by aim of hand only, there must be a great difference between an unsteady and unpractised hand, and a steady and practised ; but to do it by r ule or compass it is much alike.” 1 Born 1561, died 1626",Born,NL,8,Netherlands,Europe
"33 Nor is it merely as a logician that Bacon is entitled to notice on the present occasion. It would be difficult to name another writer prior to Locke, whose works are enriched with so many just observations on the intellectual phe¬ nomena. Among these, the most valuable re¬ late to the laws of Memory, and of Imagination; the latter of which subjects he seems to have studied with peculiar care. In one short hut beautiful paragraph concerning Poetry (under which title may be comprehended all the vari¬ ous creations of this faculty), he has exhausted every thing that philosophy and good sense have yet had to offer, on what has been since called the Beau Ideal; a topic, which has furnished occasion to so many over-refinements among the French critics, and to so much extravagance and mysticism in the cloud-clapt metaphysics of the new German school.1 In considering ima¬ gination as connected with the nervous system, more particularly as connected with that species of sympathy to which medical writers have given the mime of imitation^ he has suggested some very important hints which none of his successors have hitherto prosecuted; and has, at the same time, left an example of cautious inquiry, worthy to be studied by all who may attempt to investigate the laws regulating the union between Mind and Body.2 His illustra¬ tion of the different classes of prejudices inci¬ dent to human nature, is, in point of practical utility, at least equal to any thing on that head to be found in Locke, of whom it is impossible to forbear remarking, as a circumstance not easily explicable, that he should have resumed this important discussion, without once mention¬ ing the name of his great predecessor. The chief improvement made by Locke, in the far¬ ther prosecution of the argument, is the appli¬ cation of Hobbes’s theory of association, to ex¬ plain in what manner these prejudices are ori¬ ginally generated",,"FR,DE",8,"France,Germany","Europe,Europe"
"After all, however, it must be acknowledged, that it is rather in his general views and maxims, than in the details of his political theories, that Bacon’s sagacity appears to advantage. His notions with respect to commercial policy seem to have been more peculiarly erroneous; origi¬ nating in an overweening opinion of the efficacy of law, in matters where natural causes ought to be allowed a free operation. It is observed by Mr Hume, that the statutes of Henry VII. re¬ lating to the police of his kingdom, are generally contrived with more judgment than his com¬ mercial regulations. The same writer adds, that “ the more simple ideas of order and equity are sufficient to guide a legislator in every thing that regards the internal administration of justice; but that the principles of commerce are much more complicated, and require long experience and deep reflection to be well understood in any state. The real consequence is there often con¬ trary to first appearances. No wonder, that, during the reign of Henry VII., these matters were frequently mistaken ; and it may safely be affirmed, that, even in the age of Lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas were formed on that subject.” The instances mentioned by Hume in con¬ firmation of these general remarks, are pe¬ culiarly gratifying to those who have a pleasure in tracing the slow but certain progress of rea¬ son and liberality. “ During the reign,” says he, “ of Henry VII. it was prohibited to ex¬ analogy and consistency. To these rules Bacon gives the title of leges legnm; but the meaning of the phrase, on this oc¬ casion, differs from that in which he afterwards employed it, not less widely than the rules of Latin or of Greek syntax differ from the principles of universal grammar",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"When from such speculations as these we descend to the treatise JDe Jure Belli et Pads, the contrast is mortifying indeed. And yet, so much better suited were the talents and accom¬ plishments of Grotius to the taste, not only of his contemporaries, hut of their remote descend¬ ants, that, while the merits of Bacon failed, for a century and a half, to command the general admiration of Europe,1 Grotius continued, even in our British universities, the acknowledged Oracle of J urisprudence and of Ethics, till long after the death of Montesquieu. Nor was Bacon himself unapprised of the slow growth of his posthumous fame. No writer seems ever to have felt more deeply, that he properly belonged to a later and more enlightened age;—a sentiment which he has pathetically expressed in that clause of his testament where he “ bequeaths his name to posterity, after some generations shall he past.”2 Unbounded, however, as the reputation of Grotius was on the Continent, even before his own death, it was not till many years after the publication of the treatise De Jure Belli et Pacist that the science of Natural Jurisprudence became, in this island, an object of much attention, even 1 “ La celdbrit^ en France des ecrits du Chancelier Bacon n’a guere pour date que celle de I’Encyclopedie. —(Histoire de.s Mathematiqties par Montucla, Preface, p. ix.) It is an extraordinary circumstance, that Bayle, who has so oitcn wasted his erudition and acuteness on the most insignificant characters, and to whom Le Clerc has very justly asenbed the merit of une exactitude etonnante dans des chases de neant, should have devoted to Bacon only twelve lines of his Dictionary",,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"The period when Hobbes began his literary career, as well as the principal incidents of his life, were, in a singular degree, favourable to a mind like his; impatient of the yoke of autho¬ rity, and ambitious to attract attention, if not by solid and useful discoveries, at least by an ingenious defence of paradoxical tenets. After a residence of five years at Oxford, and a very extensive tour through France and Italy, he had the good fortune, upon his return to Eng¬ land, to be admitted into the intimacy and con¬ fidence of Lord Bacon ; a circumstance which, we may presume, contributed not a little to en¬ courage that bold spirit of inquiry, and that aversion to scholastic learning, which character¬ ise his writings. Happy, if he had, at the same time, imbibed some portion of that love of truth and zeal for the advancement of knowledge, which seem to have been Bacon s ruling pas¬ sions ! But such was the obstinacy of his tem¬ per, and his overweening self-conceit, that, in¬ stead of co-operating with Bacon in the execu¬ tion of his magnificent design, he resolved to rear, on a foundation exclusively his own, a com¬ plete structure both of Moral and Physical Science; disdaining to avail himself even of the materials collected by his predecessors, and treating the experimentarian philosophers as ob¬ jects only of contempt and ridicule !4 In the political writings of Hobbes, we may perceive the influence also of other motives",Oxford,"FR,IT,US",8,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"Not many years afterwards,1 Hobbes pushed the argument for the absolute power of princes still farther, in a work to which he gave the name of Leviathan. Under this appellation he means the body politic ; insinuating that man is an untameable beast of prey, and that govern¬ ment is the strong chain by which he is kept from mischief. The fundamental principles here maintained are the same as in the hook De Give; but as it inveighs more particularly against ec¬ clesiastical tyranny, with the view of subjecting die consciences of men to the civil authority, it lost the author the favour of some powerful pro¬ tectors he had hitherto enjoyed among the Eng¬ lish divines who attended Charles II. in France ; and he even found it convenient to quit that kingdom, and to return to England, where Crom¬ well (to whose government his political tenets were now as favourable as they were meant to be to the royal claims) suffered him to remain un¬ molested. The same circumstances operated to his disadvantage after the Restoration, and obliged the King, who always retained for him a very strong attachment, to confer his marks of favour on him with the utmost reserve and circumspection.2 The details which I have entered into, with respect to the history of Hobbes’s political writ¬ ings, will be found, by those who may peruse them, to throw much light on the author’s reason¬ ings. Indeed, it is only by thus considering them in their connection with the circumstances of the times, and the fortunes of the writer, that a just notion can be formed of their spirit and tendency",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The ethical principles of Hobbes are so com¬ pletely interwoven with his political system, that all which has been said of the one may be applied to the other. It is very remarkable, that Descartes should have thought so highly of the former, as to pronounce Hobbes to be “ a much greater master of morality than of metaphysics;” a judgment which is of itself sufficient to mark the very low state of ethical science in France about the middle of the seven¬ teenth century. Mr Addison, on the other hand, gives a decided preference (among all the books written by Hobbes) to his Treatise on Hu¬ man Nature ; and to his opinion on this point I most implicitly subscribe ; including, however, in the same commendation, some of his other philosophical essays on similiar topics. They are the only part of his works which it is pos¬ sible now to read with any interest; and they everywhere evince in their author, even when he thinks most unsoundly himself, that power of setting his reader a-thinking, which is one of the most unequivocal marks of original genius",,FR,8,France,Europe
"In the prosecution of his very able argument on this subject, Cudworth displays a rich store of enlightened and choice erudition, penetrated throughout with a peculiar vein of sobered and subdued Platonism, from whence some German systems, which have attracted no small notice in our own times, will be found, when stripped of their deep neological disguise, to have bor¬ rowed their most valuable materials.3 ' Born 1617, died 1668",Born,"NL,DE",8,"Netherlands,Germany","Europe,Europe"
"The Intellectual System of Cudworth embraces a field much wider than his treatise of Immu¬ table Morality. The latter is particularly direct¬ ed against the ethical doctrines of Hobbes, and of the Antinomians; but the former aspires to tear up by the roots all the principles, both phy¬ sical and metaphysical, of the Epicurean philo¬ sophy. It is a work, certainly, which reflects much honour on the talents of the author, and still more on the boundless extent of his learn¬ ing ; but it is so ill suited to the taste of the present age, that, since the time of Mr Harris and Dr Price, I scarcely recollect the slightest reference to it in the writings of our British me¬ taphysicians. Of its faults (beside the general disposition of the author to discuss questions placed altogether beyond the reach of our facul¬ ties), the most prominent is the wild hypothesis of a plastic nature ; or, in other words, 44 of a vital and spiritual, but unintelligent and neces¬ sary agent, created by the Deity for the execu- other thoughts laid open before it, and variety of knowledge, logical, mathematical, and moral, displayed ; but also clearly read the divine wisdom and goodness in every page of this great volume, as it were written in large and legible characters.” I do not pretend to be an adept in the philosophy of Kant; but I certainly think I pay it a very high compliment, when I suppose, that, in the Critic of Pure Reason, the leading idea is somewhat analogous to what is so much better expressed in the foregoing passage. To Kant it was probably suggested by the following very acute and decisive remark of Leibnitz on Locke’s Essay : “ Nempe, nihil est in intellectu, quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi ipse intellectus.” In justice to Aristotle, it may be here observed, that, although the general strain of his language is strictly conformable to the scholastic maxim just quoted, he does not seem to have altogether overlooked the important exception to it pointed out by Leibnitz.

"Among these events, that which is most im¬ mediately connected with our present subject, is the establishment of the Royal Society of London in 1662, which was followed a few years afterwards by that of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.

"At the head of the French writers who con¬ tributed, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, to turn the thoughts of their country¬ men to subjects connected with the Philosophy of Mind, Montaigne may, I apprehend, be justly placed. Properly speaking, he belongs to a period somewhat earlier; but his tone of think¬ ing and of writing classes him much more natu¬ rally with his successors, than with any French author who had appeared before him.1 In assigning to Montaigne so distinguished a rank in the history of modern philosophy, I need scarcely say, that I leave entirely out of the ac¬ count what constitutes (and justly constitutes) to the generality of readers the principal charm of his Essays; the good nature, humanity, and unaffected sensibility, which so irresistibly attach us to his character,—lending, it must be owned, but too often a fascination to his talk, when he cannot be recommended as the safest of com¬ panions. Nor do I lay much stress on the in¬ viting frankness and vivacity with which he un¬ bosoms himself about all his domestic habits and concerns^ and which render his book so ex¬ pressive a portrait, not only of the author, but of the Gascon country gentleman, two hundred years ago. I have in view chiefly the minute¬ ness and good faith of his details concerning his own personal qualities, both intellectual and mo¬ ral. The only study which seems ever to have engaged his attention was that of man ; and for this he was singularly fitted, by a rare com¬ bination of that talent for observation which be¬ longs to men of the world, with those habits of abstracted reflection, which men of the world have commonly so little disposition to cultivate",,FR,8,France,Europe

"death, to translate it into French from the Spa¬ nish original. His request was accordingly- complied with; and the translation is referred to hy Montaigne in the first edition of his Essays, printed at Bourdeaux in 1580; hut the execu¬ tion of this filial duty seems to have produced on Montaigne’s own mind very different effects from what his father had anticipated.1 The principal aim of Sehonde’s hook, accord¬ ing to Montaigne, is to show that “ Christians are in the wrong to make human reasoning the basis of their belief, since the object of it is only conceived hy faith, and by a special inspiration of the divine grace.” To this doctrine Mon¬ taigne professes to yield an implicit assent; and, under the shelter of it, contrives to give free vent to all the extravagances of scepticism. The essential distinction between the reason of man, and the instincts of the lower animals, is at great length, and with no inconsiderable inge¬ nuity, disputed; the powers of the human un¬ derstanding, in all inquiries, whether physical or moral, are held up to ridicule; an universal Pyrrhonism is recommended; and we are again and again reminded, that “ the senses are the be¬ ginning and the end of all our knowledge” Who¬ ever has the patience to peruse this chapter with attention, will be surprised to find in it the ru¬ diments of a great part of the licentious philo¬ sophy of the eighteenth century; nor can he fail to remark the address with which the author avails himself of the language afterwards adopt¬ ed by Bayle, Helvetius, and Hume :—“ That, to be a philosophical sceptic, is the first step to¬ wards becoming a sound believing Christian.”3 It is a melancholy fact in ecclesiastical history, that this insidious maxim should have been sanctioned, in our times, hy some theologians of no common pretensions to orthodoxy; who, in direct contradiction to the words of Scripture, have ventured to assert, that “ he who comes to God must first believe that he is not.” Is it necessary to remind these grave retailers of Bayle’s sly and ironical sophistry, that every argument for Christianity, drawn from its in¬ ternal evidence, tacitly recognises the authority of human reason; and assumes, as the ultimate criteria of truth and of falsehood, of right and of wrong, certain fundamental articles of belief, discoverable hy the light of Nature ?5 Charron is well known as the chosen friend of Montaigne’s latter years, and as the confi¬ dential depositary of his philosophical senti¬ ments. Endowed with talents far inferior in force and originality to those of his master, he possessed, nevertheless, a much sounder and more regulated judgment; and as his reputation, notwithstanding the liberality of some of his peculiar tenets, was high among the most re¬ spectable and conscientious divines of his own church, it is far from improbable, that Mon¬ taigne committed to him the guardianship of his posthumous fame, from motives similar to those which influenced Pope, in selecting Warburton as his literary executor. The discharge of this trust, however, seems to have done less good to Montaigne than harm to Charron; for while the unlimited scepticism, and the indecent levities The very few particulars known with respect to Sebonde have been collected by Bayle.—See his Dictionary, Art","Mon, Mon, Warburton","IN,PK,FR",8,"India,Pakistan,France","Asia,Asia,Europe"
"* “ I once asked Adrian Turnelus,"" says Montaigne, “ what he thought of Sebonde’s treatise. The answer he made to me was, That he believed it to be some extract from Thomas Aquinas, for that none but a genius like his was capable of such ideas.” I must not, however, omit to mention, that a very learned Protestant, Hugo Grotius, has expressed himself to his friend Bignon not unfavourably of Sebonde’s intentions, although the terms in which he speaks of him are somewhat equivocal, and imply but little satisfaction with the execution of his design. “ Non ignoras quantum excoluerint istam materiam (argumentum soil, pro Religione Christiana) philosophica sultilitate Raimundus Sebundus, dialogorum varietate Ludovicus Vives, maxima autem turn eruditione turn facundia vestras Philippus Mornaeus.” The authors of the Nouveau Dictionnaire Historique (Lyons, 1804) have entered much more completely into the spirit and drift of Sebonde’s reasoning, when they observe, “ Ce livre offre des singularites hardies, qui plurent dans le temps aux philosophes de ce siecle, et qui ne deplairoicnt pas a ceux du noire."" It is proper to add, that I am acquainted with Sebonde only through the medium of Montaigne’s version, which does not lay claim to the merit of strict fidelity; the translator himself having acknowledged, that he had given to the Spanish phi¬ losopher tk un accoutrement k la Franchise, et qu’il 1’a devetu de son port farouche et maintien barbaresque, de maniere qu’il a mes-hui assez de facjon pour se presenter en toute bonne compagnie.” DISSERTATION FIRST",,ES,8,Spain,Europe
"His argument on this point is in substance the very same with that so well urged by Beattie, in opposition to Locke’s reasonings against the existence of innate practical principles. It is difficult to say, whether, in this instance, the coincidence between Montaigne and Locke, or that between Charron and Beattie, be the more remarkable.2 3 Although Charron has affected to give to his work a systematical form, by dividing and sub¬ dividing it into books and chapters, it is in re¬ ality little more than an unconnected series of essays on various topics, more or less distantly related to the science of Ethics. On the powers of the understanding he has touched but slight¬ ly ; nor has he imitated Montaigne, in anato¬ mizing, for the edification of the world, the pe¬ culiarities of his own moral character. It has probably been owing to the desultory and po¬ pular style of composition common to both, that so little attention has been paid to either by those who have treated of the history of French philosophy. To Montaigne’s merits, indeed, as a lively and amusing essayist, ample justice has been done; but his influence on the subsequent habits of thinking among his countrymen re¬ mains still to be illustrated. He has done more, perhaps, than any other author (I am inclined to think with the most honest intentions), to in¬ troduce into men's houses (if I may borrow an expression of Cicero) what is now called the new philosophy,—a philosophy certainly very different from that of Socrates. In the fashion¬ able world, he has, for more than two centuries, maintained his place as the first of moralists; a circumstance easily accounted for, when we at¬ tend to the singular combination, exhibited in his writings, of a semblance of erudition, with what Malebranche happily calls his air du monde, and air cavalier.'5 As for the graver and less attractive Charron, his name would pro¬ bably before now have sunk into oblivion, had it not been so closely associated, by the acci¬ dental events of his life, with the more cele¬ brated name of Montaigne.4 1 Montaigne, cet auteur charmant, Tour-a-tour profond et frivole, Dans son chateau paisiblement, Loin de tout frondeur malevole, Doutoit de tout impunement, Et se moquoit tres librement Des bavards fourrds de 1’e'cole",Cicero,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"The preceding remarks lead me, by a natural connection of ideas (to which I am here much more inclined to attend than to the order of dates), to another writer of the seventeenth cen¬ tury, whose influence over the literary and phi¬ losophical taste of France has been far greater than seems to be commonly imagined. I allude to the Duke of La Rochefoucauld, author of the Maxims and Moral Reflections",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Voltaire was, I believe, the first who ventur¬ ed to assign to La Rochefoucauld the pre-emi¬ nent rank which belongs to him among the French classics. u One of the works,” says he, “ which contributed most to form the taste of the nation to a justness and precision of thought and ex¬ pression, was the small collection of maxims by Francis Duke of La Rochefoucauld. Although there he little more than one idea in the hook, that self-love is the spring of all our actions, yet this idea is presented in so great a variety of forms, as to he always amusing. When it first appeared, it was read with avidity; and it con¬ tributed, more than any other performance, since the revival of letters, to improve the vivacity, correctness, and delicacy of French composition.” Another very eminent judge of literary merit (the late Dr Johnson) was accustomed to say of La Rochefoucauld’s Maxims, that it was al¬ most the only hook written by a man of fashion, of which professed authors had reason to he jea¬ lous. Nor is this wonderful, when we consider the unwearied industry of the very accomplish¬ ed writer, in giving to every part of it the high¬ est and most finished polish which his exquisite taste could bestow. When he had committed a maxim to paper, he was in use to circulate it among his friends, that he might avail himself of their critical animadversions; and, if we may credit Segrais, altered some of them no less than thirty times, before venturing to submit them to the public eye",,FR,8,France,Europe
"That the tendency of these maxims is, upon the whole, unfavourable to morality, and that they always leave a disagreeable impression on the mind, must, I think, he granted. At the same time, it may he fairly questioned, if the motives of the author have in general been well understood, either by his admirers or his oppo¬ nents. In affirming that self-love is the spring of all our actions, there is no good reason for supposing that he meant to deny the reality of moral distinctions as a philosophical truth;—a supposition quite inconsistent with his own fine and deep remark, that hypocrisy is itself an ho¬ mage which vice renders to virtue. He states it merely as a position which, in the course of his experience as a man of the world, he had found very generally verified in the higher classes of society, and which he was induced to announce without any qualification or restriction, in order to give more force and poignancy to his satire In adopting this mode of writing, he has un¬ consciously conformed himself, like many other French authors, who have since followed his example, to a suggestion which Aristotle has stated with admirable depth and acuteness in his Rhetoric. “ Sentences or apophthegms lend much aid to eloquence. One reason of this is, that they flatter the pride of the hearers, who are delighted when the speaker, making use of general language, touches upon opinions which they had before known to be true in part. Thus, a person who had the misfortune to live in a bad neighbourhood, or to have worthless children, would easily assent to the speaker who should affirm, that nothing is more vexatious than to have any neighbours; nothing more irrational than to bring children into the world.”1 This observation of Aristotle, while it goes far to ac¬ count for the imposing and dazzling effect of these rhetorical exaggerations, ought to guard us against the common and popular error of mis- heure, qux peut esperer que sa forme presente soit en usage d’ici a cinquante ans ? il ecoule tous les jours de nos mains, et depuis que je vis s est altere de moitie.

"In reading La Rochefoucauld, it should ne¬ ver be forgotten, that it was within the vortex of a court he enjoyed his chief opportunities of studying the world; and that the narrow and exclusive circle in which he moved was not likely to afford him the most favourable speci¬ mens of human nature in general. Of the Court of Lewis XIV. in particular, we are told by a very nice and reflecting observer (Madame de la Fayette), that C£ ambition and gallantry were the soul, actuating alike both men and wo¬ men. So many contending interests, so many different cabals were constantly at work, and in all of these, women bore so important a part, that love was always mingled with business, and business with love. Nobody was tranquil or in¬ different. Every one studied to advance him¬ self by pleasing, serving, or ruining others. Idle¬ ness and languor were unknown, and nothing was thought of but intrigues or pleasures.” In the passage already quoted from Voltaire, he takes notice of the effect of La Rochefou¬ cauld’s Maxims, in improving the style of French composition. We may add to this remark, that their effect has not been less sensible in vitiating the tone and character of French philosophy, by bringing into vogue those false and degrading representations of human nature and of human life, which have prevailed in that country, more or less, for a century past. Mr Addison, in one of the papers of the Taller, expresses his in¬ dignation at this general bias among the French writers of his age. “ It is impossible,” he ob¬ serves, “ to read a passage in Plato or Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without being a greater and better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modish French authors, or those of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that nation, without being, for some time, out of humour with myself, and at everything about me. Their business is to depreciate human nature, and to consider it under the worst appearances; they give mean interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions. In short, they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man, or between the species of man and that of the brutes.”1 It is very remarkable, that the censure here bestowed by Addison on the fashionable French wits of his time should be so strictly applicable to Helvetius, and to many others of the most admired authors whom France has produced in our own day. It is still more remarkable to find the same depressing spirit shedding its malig¬ nant influence on French literature, as early as the time of La Rochefoucauld, and even of Mon¬ taigne ; and to observe how very little has been done by the successors of these old writers, but to expand into grave philosophical systems their loose and lively paradoxes; disguising and for¬ tifying them by the aid of those logical princi¬ ples, to which the name and authority of Locke have given so wide a circulation in Europe","Of, Plato, Addison, Mon","FR,TR,CO,US,IN",8,"France,Turkey,Colombia,United States,India","Europe,Asia,South America,North America,Asia"
"In tracing the origin of that false philosophy on which the excesses of the French revolu¬ tionists have entailed such merited disgrace, it is usual to remount no higher than to the profli¬ gate period of the Regency; but the seeds of its most exceptionable doctrines had been sown in that country at an earlier era, and were indebt¬ ed for the luxuriancy of their harvest, much more to the political and religious soil where they struck their roots, than to the skill or fore¬ sight of the individuals by whose hands they were scattered",,FR,8,France,Europe
"I have united the names of Montaigne and of La Rochefoucauld, because I consider their writings as rather addressed to the world at large, than to the small and select class of spe¬ culative students. Neither of them can be said to have enriched the stock of human knowledge by the addition of any one important general 1 Tatler, No. 103.

"If, in the physical sciences, his march be less sure than that of Galileo—if his logic be less cautious than that of Bacon—yet the very te¬ merity of his errors was instrumental to the progress of the human race. He gave activity to minds which the circumspection of his rivals could not awake from their lethargy. He call¬ ed upon men to throw off the yoke of authority, acknowledging no influence but what reason should avow: And his call was obeyed by a multitude of followers, encouraged by the bold¬ ness, and fascinated by the enthusiasm of their leader.” In these observations, the ingenious author has rashly generalised a conclusion deduced from the literary history of his own country. That the works of Bacon were but little read there till after the publication of D’Alembert’s Preliminary Discourse, is, I believe, an unquestionable fact;8 not that it necessarily follows from this, that, even in France, no previous effect had been produced by the labours of Boyle, of Newton, and of the other English experimentalists, trained in Bacon’s school. With respect to England, it is a fact not less certain, that at no period did the philosophy of Descartes produce such an impression on public opinion, either in Physics or in Ethics, as to give the slightest colour to the supposition, that it contributed, in the most distant degree, to the subsequent advances made by our countrymen in these sciences. In Logic and Metaphysics, indeed, the case was different. Here the writings of Descartes did much; and if they had been studied with proper attention, they might have done much more. But of this part of their me¬ rits, Condorcet seems to have had no idea. His eulogy, therefore, is rather misplaced than ex¬ cessive. He has extolled Descartes as the father of Experimental Physics: He would have been nearer the truth, if he had pointed him out as the father of the Experimental Philosophy of the Human Mind",Newton,"FR,US,UK",8,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"

It is not possible for us well to know what our souls are, but only by their xlvwru; xvxXixat, their circular or reflex motions, and converse with themselves, which can only steal from them their own secrets.”—Smith's Select Discourses, p. 65, 66",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"4. The most important, however, of all his improvements in metaphysics, is the distinction which he has so clearly and so strongly drawn between the primary and the secondary qualities of matter. This distinction was not unknown to some of the ancient schools of philosophy in Greece ; but it was afterwards rejected by Aris¬ totle, and by the schoolmen; and it was reserv¬ ed for Descartes to place it in such a light, as (with the exception of a very few sceptical or rather paradoxical theorists) to unite the opi¬ nions of all succeeding inquirers. For this step, so apparently easy, but so momentous in its con¬ sequences, Descartes was not indebted to any long or difficult processes of reasoning; but to those habits of accurate and patient attention to the operations of his own mind, which, from his early years, it was the great business of his life to cultivate. It may be proper to add, that the epithets primary and secondary, now universally employed to mark the distinction in question, were first introduced by Locke ; a circumstance posing his Treatise of Human Nature. Is it not probable, that be was partly attracted to it, by associations similar to those which presented themselves to the fancy of Cicero, when he visited the walks of the Academy ?

"It is worthy of remark, that the argument em¬ ployed by Gassendi against Descartes, is copied almost verbatim from his own version of the ac¬ count given by Diogenes Laertius of the sources of our knowledge, according to the principles of the Epicurean philosophy:1—so very little is there of novelty in the consequences deduced by modern materialists from the scholastic pro¬ position, JLihil est in intellectu quod nonfuitprius in sensu. The same doctrine is very concisely and explicitly stated in a maxim formerly quot¬ ed from Montaigne, that cc the senses are the beginning and end of all our knowledge—a maxim which Montaigne learned from his oracle Raymond de Sebonde; which, by the present race of French philosophers, is almost univer¬ sally supposed to be sanctioned by the authority of Locke; and which, if true, would at once cut up by the roots, not only all metaphysics, but all ethics, and all religion, both natural and revealed. It is accordingly with this very maxim that Madame du Deffand (in a letter which ri¬ vals anything that the fancy of Moliere has con¬ ceived in his JFemmes Savantes) assails Voltaire for his imbecility in attempting a reply to an atheistical book then recently published.

"has contributed a greater number of original re¬ marks than Locke himself;1 since whose time, with the single exception of Helvetius, hardly any attention has been paid to it, either by French or English metaphysicians. The same practical knowledge of the human understand¬ ing, modified and diversified, as we everywhere see it, by education and external circumstances, is occasionally discovered by his very able anta¬ gonist Arnauld; affording, in both cases, a sa¬ tisfactory proof, that the narrowest field of ex¬ perience may disclose to a superior mind those refined and comprehensive results, which com¬ mon observers are forced to collect from an ex¬ tensive and varied commerce with the world",,"FR,UK",8,"France,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Fine as his imagination was, it could scarcely have added to the picturesque effect of the real scene.2 Anthony Arnauld, whom I have already men¬ tioned as one of the theological antagonists of Malehranche, is also entitled to a distinguished rank among the French philosophers of this period. In his book on true and false ideas, writ¬ ten in opposition to Malebranche’s scheme of our seeing all things in God, he is acknowledg¬ ed by Dr Reid to have struck the first mortal blow at the ideal theory ; and to have appioxi- mated very nearly to his own refutation of this ancient and inveterate prejudice.3 A step so important would, of itself, be sufficient to esta¬ blish his claim to a place in literary history ; but what chiefly induces me again to bring forward his name, is the reputation he has so justly ac¬ quired by his treatise, entitled, The Art of Thinking ;4 a treatise written by Arnauld, in conjunction with his friend Nicole, and of which (considering the time when it appeared) it is hardly possible to estimate the merits too highly",,FR,8,France,Europe

"Abstracting from his great merits in mathema¬ tics and in physics, his reputation rests chiefly on the Provincial Letters; a work from which Voltaire, notwithstanding his strong prejudices against the author, dates the fixation of the French language; and of which the same ex¬ cellent judge has said, that “ Moliere’s best comedies do not excel them in wit, nor the com¬ positions of Bossuet in sublimity.” The enthu¬ siastic admiration of Gibbon for this book, which he was accustomed from his youth to read once a year, is well known, and is sufficient to ac¬ count for the rapture with which it never fails to be spoken of by the erudite vulgar* in this country. I cannot help, however, suspecting, 1 According to Crousaz, The Art of Thinking contributed more than either the Organon of Bacon, or the Method of Des¬ cartes, to improve the established modes of academical education on the Continent—(See the Preface to his Logic, printed at Geneva, 1724.) Leibnitz himself has mentioned it in the most flattering terms; coupling the name of the author with that of Pascal, a still more illustrious ornament of the Port-Royal Society“ Ingeniosissimus Pascalius in prseclara dissertatione de ingemo Geometrico, cujus fragmentum extat in egregio hbro celeberrimi viri Antonii Ar- naldi de Arte bene Cogitandi,” &c..; but lest this encomium from so high an authority should excite a curiosity somewhat out of proportion to the real value of the two works here mentioned, I think it right to add, that the praises bestowed by Leibnitz, whether on living or dead authors, are not always to be strictly and literally interpreted. “ No one,” says Hume, “ is so liable to an excess of admiration as a truly great genius.” Wherever Leibnitz has occasion to refer to any work of solid merit, this remark applies to him with peculiar force ; partly, it is probable, from his quick and sympathetic perception of congenial excellence, and partly from a generous anxiety to point it out to the notice of the world. It af¬ fords, on the other hand, a remarkable illustration of the force of prejudice, that Buffler, a learned and most able Jesuit, should have been so far influenced by the hatred of his order to the Jansenists, as to distinguish the Port-Royal Logic with the cold approbation of being “ a judicious compilation fiom former works on the same subject,—particularly from a trea¬ tise by a Spanish Jesuit, Fonstca.""—Cours de Sciences, p. 873. Paris, 1732.

The glow-worm ’gins to pale his ineffectual Jire ; and we scent the morning air of the coming day.

"One celebrated Work alone, the treatise of Grotius De Jure Belli et Pads (first printed in 1625), arrests our attention among the crowd of useless and forgotten volumes, which were then issuing from the presses of Holland, Ger¬ many, and Italy. The influence of this treatise, in giving a new direction to the studies of the learned, was so remarkable, and continued so long to operate with undiminished effect, that it is necessary to allot to the author, and to his successors, a space considerably larger than may, at first sight, seem due to their merits. Not¬ withstanding the just neglect into which they have lately fallen in our universities, it will be found, on a close examination, that they form an important link in the history of modern lite¬ rature. It was from their school that most of dur best writers on Ethics have proceeded, and many of our most original inquirers into the Human Mind; and it is to the same school (as 1 I have classed Ttltmaque and the Direction pour la Conscience d'un Rot with the philosophy of the seventeenth century, although the publication of the former was not permitted till after the death of Louis XIV. nor that of the latter till 1748",Holland,"IT,US",8,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"That moral distinctions are created entirely by the arbitrary and revealed will of God, had, be¬ fore his time, been zealously maintained by some theologians even of the reformed church; while, among the political theorists of the same period, it was not unusual to refer these distinctions (as was afterwards done hy Hobbes) to the positive institutions of the civil magistrate. In opposi¬ tion to both, it was contended hy Grotius, that there is a natural law coeval with the human constitution, from which positive institutions derive all their force; a truth which, how ob¬ vious and trite soever it may now appear, was so opposite in its spirit to the illiberal systems taught in the monkish establishments, that he thought it necessary to exhaust in its support all his stores of ancient learning. The older waiters on Jurisprudence must, I think, he al¬ lowed to have had great merit in dwelling so much on this fundamental principle; a principle which renders “ Man a Law to himself;” and which, if it be once admitted, reduces the meta¬ physical question concerning the nature of the moral faculty, to an object merely of speculative curiosity.1 2 To this faculty the ancients fre¬ quently give the name of reason; as in that noted passage of Cicero, where he observes, that “ right reason is itself a law ; congenial to the feelings of nature; diffused among all men; uniform ; eternal; calling us imperiously to our duty, and peremptorily prohibiting every viola¬ tion of it. Nor does it speak,” continues the same author, “ one language at Rome and ano¬ ther at Athens, varying from place to place, or time to time; hut it addresses itself to all na¬ tions and to all ages; deriving its authority from the common sovereign of the universe, and carrying home its sanctions to every breast, hy the inevitable punishment which it inflicts on transgressors.”3 The habit of considering morality under the similitude of a law (a law engraved on the hu¬ man heart), led not unnaturally to an applica¬ tion to ethical subjects of the technical language and arrangements of the Roman jurisprudence, and this innovation was at once facilitated and 1 “ Upon whatever we suppose that our moral faculties are founded, whether upon a certain modification of reason, upon an original instinct, called a moral sense, or upon some other principle of our nature, it cannot be doubted that they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They carry along with them the most evident badges of this autho¬ rity, which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, to superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained. The rules, therefore, which they prescribe, are to be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those vicege¬ rents which he has set up within us.”—Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part in. chap, v.)—See also Dr Butler’s very original and philosophical Discourses on Human Nature","Man, Cicero, Rome, Athens, Roman","US,CI,RO",8,"United States,Côte d'Ivoire,Romania","North America,Africa,Europe"
"2. It was probably in consequence of the very narrow field of study which Jurisprudence, con¬ sidered in this light, was found to open, that its province was gradually enlarged, so as to com¬ prehend, not merely the rules of justice, but the rules enjoining all our other moral duties. Nor was it only the province of Jurisprudence which was thus enlarged. A corresponding extension was also given, by the help of arbitrary defini¬ tions, to its technical phraseology, till at length the whole doctrines of practical ethics came to he moulded into an artificial form, originally copied from the Roman code. Although justice is the only branch of virtue in which every mo¬ ral Obligation implies a corresponding Right, the writers on Natural Law have contrived, hy fictions of imperfect rights, and of external rights, to treat indirectly of all our various duties, by pointing out the rights which are supposed to be their correlates:—in other words, they have con¬ trived to exhibit, in the form of a system of rights, a connected view of the whole duty of man. This idea of Jurisprudence, which iden¬ tifies its object with that of Moral Philosophy, seems to coincide nearly with that of Puffen- dorff; and some vague notion of the same sort 1 Theory of Moral Sentimentt, Part vii. sect. iy",Roman,RO,8,Romania,Europe
"Whatever judgment may now be pronounced on the effects of this innovation, it is certain that they were considered, not only at the time, but for many years afterwards, as highly fa’s our- able. A very learned and respectable writer, Mr Carmichael of Glasgow, compares them to the improvements made in Natural Philosophy by the followers of Lord Bacon. No person, he observes, “ liberally educated, can be igno¬ rant, that, within the recollection of ourselves and of our fathers, philosophy has advanced to a state of progressive improvement hitherto un¬ exampled ; in consequence partly of the rejection of scholastic absurdities, and partly of the ac¬ cession of new discoveries. Nor does this re¬ mark apply solely to Natural Philosophy, in which the improvements accomplished by the united labours of the learned have forced them¬ selves on the notice even of the vulgar, by their palpable influence on the mechanical arts. The other branches of philosophy also have been pro¬ secuted during the last century with no less suc¬ cess ; and none of them in a more remarkable degree than the science of Morals",Glasgow,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"u This science, so much esteemed, and so as¬ siduously cultivated by the sages of antiquity, lay, for a length of time, in common with all the other useful arts, buried in the rubbish of the dark ages, till (soon after the commencement of the seventeenth century), the incomparable treatise of Grotius de Jure Belli et Pads restored to more than its ancient splendour that part of it which defines the relative duties of individu¬ als ; and which, in consequence of the immense variety of cases comprehended under it, is by far the most extensive of any. Since that period, the most learned and polite scholars of Europe, as if suddenly roused by the alarm of a trumpet, have vied with each other in the prosecution of this study,—so strongly recommended to their attention, not merely by its novelty, but by the importance of its conclusions, and the dignity of its object.”1 I have selected this passage, in preference to many others that might be quoted to the same purpose from writers of higher name; because, in the sequel of this historical sketch, it appears to me peculiarly interesting to mark the progress of Ethical and Political speculation in that seat of learning, which, not many years afterwards, was to give birth to the Theory of Moral Senti¬ ments, and to the Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. The powerful effect which the last of these works has produced on the political opinions of the whole civilised world, renders it unnecessary, in a Discourse destined to form part of a Scotish Encyclopedia, to offer any apology for attempting to trace, with some 1 The last sentence is thus expressed in the original. “ Ex illo tempore, quasi classico dato, ah eruditissirms Passim et politissimis viris excoli certatim coepit, utilissima hsec nohilissimaque doctrina.”—See the edition ot i utiendortt, De (JJicio Hominis et Civis, by Professor Gerschom Carmichael of Glasgow, 1724; an author whom Dr Hutchison pronounces to^be “ by far the best commentator on PuffendorfF; and “ whose notes,"" he adds, “ are of much more value than the text","Carmichael, Glasgow","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"To so late a period did this admiration of the treatise De Officio Hominis et Civis, continue in our Scotch Universities, that the very learned and respectable Sir John Pringle (afterwards President of the lloyal Society of London), adopted it as the text-bcok for his lectures, while he held the Professorship of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh. Nor does the case seem to have been different in England. “ I am going,” says Gray, in a letter written while a student at Cambridge, “ to attend a lecture on one Puffendorff” And, much in the same spirit, Voltaire thus expresses himself with respect to the schools of the Continent:—“ On est partage, dans les dcoles, entre Grotius et Puffendorff. Croyez-moi, hsez les Offices de Ciceron.” From the contemptuous tone of these two writers, it should seem that the old systems of Natural Jurispru¬ dence had entirely lost their credit among men of taste and of enlarged views, long before they ceased to form an essential part of academical instruction; thus affording an additional confirmation of Mr Smith’s complaint, that the greater part ot universities have not been very forward to adopt improvements after they were made; and that several of those learned societies have chosen to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems found shelter and protection, after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the world.” Considering his own successful exertions in his aca¬ demical capacity, to remedy this evil, it is more than probable that Mr Smith had Grotius and Puffendorff in his view when he wrote the foregoing sentence","London, Edinburgh, Cambridge","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"The extravagance of the praise lavished on Grotius and Puffendorff, in the above citation from Carmichael, can he accounted for only by the degraded state into which Ethics had fallen in the hands of those who were led to the study of it, either as a preparation for the casuistical discussions subservient to the practice ofauricular confession, or to justify a scheme of morality which recommended the useless austerities of an ascetic retirement, in preference to the manly duties of social life. The practical doctrines inculcated by the writers on Natural Law, were all of them favourable to active virtue; and, how reprehensible soever in point of form, were not only harmless, but highly beneficial in their tendency. They were at the same time so di¬ versified (particularly in the work of Grotius) with beautiful quotations from the Greek and Roman classics, that they could not fail to pre¬ sent a striking contrast to the absurd and illibe¬ ral systems which they supplanted; and per¬ haps to these passages, to which they thus gave a sort of systematical connection, the progress which the science made in the course of the eighteenth century may, in no inconsiderable degree, be ascribed. Even now, when so very different a taste prevails, the treatise de Jure Belli et Pads possesses many charms to a classi¬ cal reader; who, although he may not always set a very high value on the author’s reasonings, must at least be dazzled and delighted with the splendid profusion of his learning","Carmichael, Roman","US,RO,GR",8,"United States,Romania,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe"
"In a late publication, from the title of which some attention to dates might have been expected, we are told, that “ Hobbes’s book De Give appeared but a little time before the treatise of Grotius whereas, in point of fact, Hobbes’s book did not appear till twenty-two years after it. A few copies were indeed printed at Paris, and privately circulated by Hobbes, as early as 1642, but the book was not published till 1647-—(See “ An Inquiry into the Foundation and History of the Law of Nations in Europe” &c. by Robert Ward of the Inner Temple, Esq.

"£t It might have been expected,” says Mr Smith, {C that the reasonings of lawyers upon the different imperfections and improvements of the laws of different countries, should have given occasion to an inquiry into what were the natural rules of justice, independent of all positive institution. It might have been ex¬ pected, that these reasonings should have led them to aim at establishing a system of what might properly be called Natural Jurisprudence, or a theory of the principles which ought to run through^ and to he the foundation of the laws of all nations. But, though the reasonings of lawyers did produce something of this kind, and though no man has treated systematically of the laws of any particular country, without intermixing in his work many observations of this sort, it was very late in the world before any such general system was thought of, or before the philosophy of laws was treated of by itself, and without regard to the particular institutions of any na¬ tion. Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which ought to run through, and be the foundation of the laws of all nations; and his Treatise of the Laws of Peace and War, with all its imperfections, is per¬ haps, at this day, the most complete work that has yet been given on the subject.” Whether this was, or was not, the leading object of Grotius, it is not material to decide; but if this was his object, it will not be disputed that he has executed his design in a very desul¬ tory manner, and that he often seems to have lost sight of it altogether, in the midst of those miscellaneous speculations on political, ethical, and historical subjects, which form so large a portion of his Treatise, and which so frequently succeed each other without any apparent con¬ nection or common aim.1 Nor do the views of Grotius appear always enlarged or just, even when he is pointing at the object described by Mr Smith. The Roman system of Jurisprudence seems to have warped, in no inconsiderable degree, his notions on all questions connected with the theory of legisla¬ tion, and to have diverted his attention from that philosophical idea of law, so well expressed by Cicero,—“ Non a prsetoris edicto, neque a duodecim tabulis, sed penitus ex intima philo- sophia, hauriendam juris disciplinam.” In this idolatry, indeed, of the Roman law, he has not gone so far as some of his commentators, who have affirmed, that it is only a different name for the Law of Nature; but that his partiality for his professional pursuits has often led him to overlook the immense difference between the state of society in ancient and modern Europe, will not, I believe, be now disputed. It must, at the same time, be mentioned to his praise, that no writer appears to have been, in theory) more completely aware of the essential distinc¬ tion between Natural and Municipal laws. In one of the paragraphs of his Prolegomena) he mentions it as a part of his general plan, to illus¬ trate the Roman code, and to systematise those parts of it which have their origin in the Law of Nature. <£ The task,” says he, ££ of mould¬ ing it into the form of a system, has been pro¬ jected by many, but hitherto accomplished by none. Nor indeed was the thing possible, while so little attention was paid to the distinction between natural and positive institutions; for the former being everywhere the same, may be easily traced to a few general principles, while the latter, exhibiting different appearances at different times, and in different places, elude 1 “ Of what stamp,” says a most ingenious and original thinker, “ are the works of Grotius, Puffendorff, and Ilurla- maqui?

"every attempt towards methodical arrangement, no less than the insulated facts which indi¬ vidual objects present to our external senses.” This passage of Grotius has given great of¬ fence to two of the most eminent of his com¬ mentators, Henry and Samuel de Cocceii, who have laboured much to vindicate the Roman le¬ gislators against that indirect censure which the words of Grotius appear to convey. “ My chief object,” says the latter of those writers, “ was, by deducing the Roman Law from its source in the nature of things, to reconcile Natural Juris¬ prudence with the civil code; and, at the same time, to correct the supposition implied in the foregoing passage of Grotius, which is indeed one of the most exceptionable to he found in his work",Roman,RO,8,Romania,Europe
"The superstitious veneration for the Roman code expressed by such writers as the Cocceii, will appear less wonderful, when we attend to the influence of the same prejudice on the libe¬ ral and philosophical mind of Leibnitz; an au¬ thor who has not only gone so far as to com¬ pare the civil law (considered as a monument of human genius) with the remains of the an¬ cient Greek geometry; but has strongly inti¬ mated his dissent from the opinions of those who have Represented its principles as being fre¬ quently at variance with the Law of Nature",Roman,"RO,GR",8,"Romania,Greece","Europe,Europe"
"In one very powerful paragraph, he expresses himself thus t—“ I have often said, that, after the writings of geometricians, there exists no¬ thing which, in point of strength, subtlety, and depth, can be compared to the works of the Ro¬ man lawyers. And as it would be scarcely pos¬ sible, from mere intrinsic evidence, to distin¬ guish a demonstration of Euclid’s from one of Archimedes or of Appollonius (the style of all of them appearing no less uniform than if rea¬ son herself were speaking through their organs), so also the Roman lawyers all resemble each other like twin-brothers; inasmuch that, from the style alone of any particular opinion or ar¬ gument, hardly any conjecture could be formed about its author. Nor are the traces of a re¬ fined and deeply meditated system of Natural Ju¬ risprudence anywhere to be found more visible, or in greater abundance. And even in those cases where its principles are departed from, either in compliance with the language conse¬ crated by technical forms, or in consequence of new statutes, or of ancient traditions, the con¬ clusions which the assumed hypothesis renders it necessary to incorporate with the eternal dic¬ tates of right reason, are deduced with the soundest logic, and with an ingenuity that ex¬ cites admiration. Nor are these deviations from the Law of Nature so frequent as is commonly apprehended.” In the last sentence of this passage, Leibnitz had probably an eye to the works of Grotius and his followers; which, however narrow and ti¬ mid in their views they may now appear, were, for a long time, regarded among civilians as savouring somewhat of theoretical innovation, and of political heresy","Euclid, Roman","US,RO",8,"United States,Romania","North America,Europe"
"Instead of confining himself, after the example of his predecessors, to an interpretation of one part of the Roman code by another, he studied the Spirit of these laws in the political views of their authors, and in the peculiar circumstances of that extraordinary race. He combined the science of law with the history of political society, employing the latter to account for the varying aims of the legislator; and the former, in its turn, to explain the nature of the govern¬ ment, and the manners of the people. Nor did he limit his inquiries to the Roman Law, and to Roman History; but, convinced that the general principles of human nature are everywhere the same, he searched for new lights among the sub¬ jects of every government, and the inhabitants of every climate; and, while he thus opened inexhaustible and unthought of resources to the student of Jurisprudence, he indirectly marked out to the legislator the extent and the limits of his power, and recalled the attention of the philosopher from abstract and useless theories, to the only authentic monuments of the history of mankind.2 is, t ough somewhat ambiguously expressed, must, I think, have been the idea of D’Alembert in the following sen- ,eJJ,ce * ®uvraSe’ de Montesquieu s’occupe moins des loix qu’on a faites, que de celles qu’on a du faire.”  , ?gc e •. e ontesqmeu.)

"If the foregoing details should appear tedious to some of my readers, I must request them to recollect, that they relate to a science which, for much more than a hundred years, constitu¬ ted the whole of philosophy, both ethical and political, of the largest portion of civilised Eu¬ rope. With respect to Germany, in particu¬ lar, it appears from the Count de Hertzherg, that this science continued to maintain its un¬ disputed ground, till it was supplanted by that growing passion for Statistical details, which, of late, has given a direction so different, and in some respects so opposite, to the studies of his countrymen.1 When from Germany we turn our eyes to the south of Europe, the prospect seems not merely sterile, hut afflicting and almost hope¬ less. Of Spanish literature I know nothing hut through the medium of Translations; a very imperfect one, undoubtedly, when a judgment is to he passed on compositions addressed to the powers of imagination and taste; yet fully sufficient to enable us to form an estimate of works which treat of science and philosophy",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"<c The only good book,” says Montesquieu, “ which the Spaniards have to boast of, is that which exposes the absurdity of all the rest.” In this remark, I have little doubt that there is a considerable sacrifice of truth to the pointed effect of an antithesis. The unqualified censure, at the same time, of this great man, is not un¬ worthy of notice, as a strong expression of his feelings with respect to the general insignificance of the Spanish writers.2 The inimitable work here referred to by Montesquieu, is itself entitled to a place in this Discourse, not only as one of the happiest and most wonderful creations of human fancy, but as the record of a force of character, and an en¬ largement of mind, which, when contrasted with the prejudices of the author’s age and nation, seem almost miraculous. It is not merely against Books of Chivalry that the satire of Cer¬ vantes is directed. Many other follies and ab¬ surdities of a less local and temporary nature have their share in his ridicule; while not a single expression escapes his pen that can give offence to the most fastidious moralist. Hence those amusing and interesting contrasts by which Cervantes so powerfully attaches us to the hero of his story; chastising the wildest freaks of a disordered imagination, by a stateli¬ ness yet courtesy of virtue, and (on all subjects but one) by a superiority of good sense and of philosophical refinement, which, even under the most ludicrous circumstances, never cease to    ; | 1 “ La connoissance des dtats qu’on se plait aujourd’hui d’appeller Statistiqiie, est une de ces sciences qui sent devenues k la mode, et qui ont pris une vogue generale depuis quelques anndes ; elle a presque depossdde celle du Droit Public, qui regnoit au commencement et jusques vers le milieu du siecle present.”—Reflexions sur la Force des Flats.

"Hence that Index of prohibited books, into which were put the history of the President de Thou ; the works on the liberties of the Gallican church; and (who could have believed it?) the transla¬ tions of the Holy Scriptures. Meanwhile, this tribunal, though always ready to condemn ju¬ dicious authors upon frivolous suspicions of heresy, approved those seditious and fanatical theologists, whose writings tended to the en¬ couragement of regicide, and the destruction of government. The approbation and censure of books (it is justly added) deserves a place in the history of the human mind.” The great glory of the Continent towards the end of the seventeenth century (I except only the philosophers of France) was Leibnitz. He was born as early as 1646, and distinguished him¬ self, while still a very young man, by a display of those talents which were afterwards to con¬ tend with the united powers of Clarke and of Newton. I have already introduced his name among the writers on Natural Law; but, in every other respect, he ranks more fitly with the contemporaries of his old age than with those of his youth. My reasons for thinking so will appear in the sequel.

"In 1666, Mr Locke, then in his thirty-fifth year, formed an intimate acquaintance with Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury; from which period a complete change took place, both in the direction of his studies, and in his habits of life. His attention appears to have been then turned, for the first time, to political subj ects: and his place of residence transferred from the university to the metropolis. From London (a scene which gave him access to a society very different from what he had previously lived in)4 he occasionally passed over to the Continent, where he had an opportunity of profiting by the conversation of some of the most distinguished persons of his age. In the course of his fo¬ reign excursions, he visited France, Germany, and Holland; but the last of these countries seems to have been his favourite place of resi¬ dence ; the blessings which the people there en¬ joyed, under a government peculiarly favourable to civil and religious liberty, amply compensat- 1 Published in the year 1676",Holland,"FR,DE,US",8,"France,Germany,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"2 It is remarked of Sydenham, by the late Dr John Gregory, “ That though full of hypothetical reasoning, it had not the usual effect of making him less attentive to observation ; and that his hypotheses seem to have sat so loosely about him, that either they did not influence his practice at all, or he could easily abandon them, whenever they would not bend to his experience.” f This is precisely the idea of Locke concerning the true use of hypotheses. “ Hypotheses, if they are well made, are at least great helps to the memory, and often direct us to new discoveries.”—Locke’s Works, Vol. III. p. 81- See also some remarks on the same subject in one of his letters to Mr Molyneux.

"The works of Descartes still continued to be studied and admired; and the combined systems of the English and the French metaphysicians served, in many respects, to correct what was faulty, and to supply what was deficient, in each. As to the ethical principles of Locke, where they appear to lean towards Hobbism, a powerful antidote against them was already prepared in the Treatise De Jure Belli et Pads, which was then universally and deservedly re¬ garded in this country as the best introduction that had yet appeared to the study of moral science. If Scotland, at this period, produced no eminent authors in these branches of learn¬ ing, it was not from want of erudition or of ta¬ lents ; nor yet from the narrowness of mind in¬ cident to the inhabitants of remote and insula¬ ted regions; but from the almost insuperable difficulty of writing in a dialect, which imposed upon an author the double task of at once ac¬ quiring a new language, and of unlearning his own.3 4 The success of Locke’s Essay, in some parts of the Continent, was equally remarkable; owing, no doubt, in the first instance, to the very accurate translation of it into the French language by Coste, and to the eagerness with which every thing proceeding from the author of the Letters m Toleration^ may be presumed to 1 “ It was proposed at a meeting of the heads of houses of the University of Oxford, to censure and discourage the reading of Locke’s Essay; and, after various debates among themselves, it was concluded, that each head of a house should endeavour to prevent its being read in his college, without coming to any public censure.”—(See Des Maizeaux’s note on a letter from Locke to Collins—Locke’s Works, Vol. X. p. 284","University, Oxford","US,FR,UK",8,"United States,France,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"have been read by the multitude of learned and enlightened refugees, whom the revocation of the edict of Nantz forced to seek an asylum in Protestant countries. In Holland, where Locke was personally known to the most distinguish¬ ed characters, both literary and political, his work was read and praised by a discerning few, with all the partiality of friendship;1 but it does not seem to have made its way into the schools till a period considerably later. The doctrines of Descartes, at first so vehemently opposed in that country, were now so completely triumph¬ ant, both among philosophers and divines,2 that it was difficult for a new reformer to obtain a hearing. The case was very nearly similar in Germany, where Leibnitz (who always speaks coldly of Locke’s Essay)5 was then looked up to as the great oracle in every branch of learn¬ ing and of science. If I am not mistaken, it was in Switzerland, where (as Gibbon observes) “ the intermixture of sects had rendered the clergy acute and learned on controversial topics,” that Locke’s real merits were first appreciated on the Continent with a discriminating impartia¬ lity. In Crousaz’s Treatise of Logic (a book which, if not distinguished by originality of ge¬ nius, is at least strongly marked with the sound and unprejudiced judgment of the author), we everywhere trace the influence of Locke’s doc¬ trines ; and, at the same time, the effects of the Cartesian Metaphysics, in limiting those hasty expressions of Locke, which have been so often misinterpreted by his followers.4 Nor do Crou¬ saz’s academical labours appear to have been less indissolubiles videantur; postea tamen larvam exult, et atheismum clare professus est, et justissime in inclyta urbe ThOEOSA DAMNATUS E8T ET CREMATES",,"DE,CH",8,"Germany,Switzerland","Europe,Europe"
"107 useful than his writings; if a judgment on this point may be formed from the sound philosophi¬ cal principles which he diffused among a nume¬ rous race of pupils. One of these (M. Alla- mand), the friend and correspondent of Gibbon, deserves particularly to be noticed here, on ac¬ count of two letters published in the posthumous works of that historian, containing a criticism on Locke’s argument against innate ideas, so very able and judicious, that it may still be read with advantage by many logicians of no small note in the learned world. Had these letters hap¬ pened to have sooner attracted my attention, I should not have delayed so long to do this tardy j ustice to their merits.1 I am not able to speak with confidence of the period at which Locke’s Essay began to attract public notice in France. Voltaire, in a letter to Horace Walpole, asserts, that he was the first person who made the name of Locke known to his countrymen ;2 but I suspect that this asser¬ tion must be received with considerable quali¬ fications. The striking coincidence between some of Locke’s most celebrated doctrines and those of Gassendi, can scarcely be supposed to have been altogether overlooked by the followers and admirers of the latter ; considering the im¬ mediate and very general circulation given on the Continent to the Essay on Human Understanding, by Coste’s French version. The Gassendists, too, it must be remembered, formed, even before the death of their master, a party formidable in talents as well as in numbers; including, among other distinguished names, those of Moliere,5 even in his own country, at the end of a few years, his name and writings are almost obliterated. But his Philosophy had been formed in the school of Locke, his Divinity in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious life, several generations of pupils were taught to think, and even to write ; his lessons rescued the Academy of Lausanne from Cal- vinistic prejudices ; and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit among the people of the Pays de Vaud.""— (Gibbon’s Memoirs^) In a subsequent passage Gibbon says, “ the logic of Crousaz had prepared me to engage with his master Locke, and his antagonist Bayle ; of whom the former may be used as a bridle, and the latter applied as a spur to the curiosity of a young philosopher.”—(IUd.)

But what I esteem most of all,—from the perusal and meditation of De Crousaz’s logic, I not only understood the principles of that science, but formed my mind to a habit of thinking and reasoning, I had no idea of before.” After all, I very readily grant, that Crousaz’s logic is chiefly to be regarded as the work of a sagacious and enlightened compiler; but even this (due allowance being made for the state of philosophy when it appeared) is no mean praise",Naples,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"Of this extraordinary man Gibbon gives the following account in his Journal; “ C’est un ministre dans le Pays de Vaud, et un des plus beaux genies que je connoisse. II a voulu embrasser tous les genres ; mais c’est la. Philosophic qu’il a le plus approfondi. Sur toutes les questions il s’est fait des systemes, ou du moins des argumens toujours originaux et tou- jours ingenieux. Ses idees sont fines et lumineuses, son expression heureuse et facile. On lui reproche avec raison trop de rafinement et de subtilitd dans 1’esprit; trop de fierte, trop d’ambition, et trop de violence dans le caractere. Cet homme, qui auroit pu eclairer ou troubler une nation, vit et mourra dans 1’obscurite'.” It is of the same person that Gibbon sneeringly says, in the words of Vossius, “ Est sacrificulus in pago, et rusticos decipit.” 2 “ Je peux vous assurer qu’avant moi personne en France ne connoissoit la poesie Angloise; h peine avoit on entendu parler de Locke. J’ai e'te' persecute' pendant trente ans par une nude de fanatiques pour avoir dit que Locke est 1’Her- cule de la Metaphysique, qui a pose les bornes de I’Esprit Humain.”—(Ferney, 1768.) In the following passage of the Age of Louis XIV. the same celebrated writer is so lavish and undistinguishing in his praise of Locke, as almost to justify a doubt whether he had ever read the book which he extols so highly. “ Locke seul a developpd Ventendement humain, dans un livre oil il n’y a que des veritds; et ce qui rend 1’ouvrage parfait, toutes ces verites sont claires.” 3 Moliere was in his youth so strongly attached to the Epicurean theories, that he had projected a translation of Lu¬ cretius into French. He is even said to have made some progress in executing his design, when a trifling accident de¬ termined him, in a moment of ill humour, to throw his manuscript into the fire. The plan on which he was to proceed in this bold undertaking does honour to his good sense and good taste, and seems to me the only one on.which a successful version of Lucretius can ever be executed. The didactic passages of the poem were to be translated into prose, and. the descriptive passages into verse. Both paxts would have gained greatly by this compromise; for, where Lucretius wishes to unfold the philosophy of his master, he is not less admirable for the perspicuity and precision of his expressions, than he is on other occasions, where his object is to detain and delight the imaginations of his readers, for the charms of his figurative diction, and for the bold relief of his images.

"it can thus establish its affinity, is destitute of signification.”—{Oeuvres de Diderot, Tom. VI.) Such is the exposition given by Diderot, of what is regarded in France as Locke’s great and capital discovery ; and precisely to the same purpose we are told by Condorcet, that “ Locke was the first who proved that ad our ideas are compounded of sensations.,,—{Esquisse Historique, &c.) If this were to be admitted as a fair account of Locke’s opinion, it would follow, that he has not advanced a single step beyond Gassendi and Hobbes; both of whom have repeatedly expressed themselves in nearly the same words with Di¬ derot and Condorcet. But although it must be granted, in favour of their interpretation of his language, that various detached passages may be quoted from his work, which seem, on a superficial view, to justify their comments, yet of what weight, it may be asked, are these pas¬ sages, when compared with the stress laid by the author on Reflection, as an original source of our ideas, altogether different from Sensation ? “ The other fountain,” says Locke, “ from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas, is the perception of the operations of our own minds within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got; which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without; and such are Perception, Thinking, Doubting, Be- “ Let the ideas of being and matter be strongly joined either by education or much thought, whilst these are still com¬ bined in the mind, what notions, what reasonings will there be about separate spirits ? Let custom, from the very childhood, have joined figure and shape to the idea of God, and what absurdities will that mind be liable to about the Deity ?”—(Yol",,FR,8,France,Europe
"In this lax interpretation of a principle so completely interwoven with the whole of his philosophy, there is undoubtedly a departure from logical accuracy ; and the same remark may be extended to the vague and indefinite use which he occasion¬ ally makes of the word Reflection; a word which expresses the peculiar and characteristical doctrine, by which his system is distinguished from that of the Gassendists and Hobbists. All this, however, serves only to prove still more clearly, how widely remote his real opinion on this subject was from that commonly ascribed to him by the f rench ami German com¬ mentators. For my own part, I do not think, notwithstanding some casual expressions which may seem to favour the con¬ trary supposition, that Locke would have hesitated for a moment to admit, with Cud worth and Price, that the Understand¬ ing is itself a source of new ideas. That it is by Reflection (which, according to his own definition, means merely the exercise of the Understanding on the internal phenomena) that we get our ideas of memory, imagination, reasoning, and of all other intellectual powers, Mr Locke has again and again told us; and from this principle it is so obvious an inference, that all the simple ideas which are necessarily implied in our intellectual operations, are ultimately to be referred to the same source, that we cannot reasonably suppose a philosopher of Locke’s sagacity to admit the former proposition, and to withhold his assent to the latter. .

"That the same mistake still keeps its ground among many foreign writers of the highest class, the following passage affords a sufficient proof: “ Leibnitz a combattu avec une force de dialectique admirable le Systeme de Locke, qui attribue toutes nos idees a nos sensations. On avoit mis en avant cet axiome si connu, qu’il n’y avoit rien dans I’intelligence qui n’eut dtd d’abord dans les sensations, et Leibnitz y ajouta cette sublime restriction, si ce n'est Vintelligence elle-meme. De ce principe derive toute la philosophie nouvelle qui exerce tant d’influence sur les esprits en Allemagne.”—(Mad. de Stael de VAlle- magne, Tom. III. p. 65.) I observed in the First Part of this Dissertation (page 67), that this sublime restriction on which so much stress has been laid by the partizans of the German school, is little more than a translation of the following words of Aristotle: Kal abroi vovs vonro; iffnv, cStrvritJ ra. votira."" it/ /u.lv ya/) rwv uvtii vXris, to avrb Itt/ to vaovv xa) to voou^msvov.—(De Anima, Lib. III. cap. V.) As to Locke, the same injustice which he received from Leibnitz was very early done to him in his own country. In a tract printed in 1697, by a mathematician of some note, the author of the Essay on Human Understanding is represented as holding the same opinion with Gassendi concerning the origin of our ideas. “ Ideas nomine sensu utor; earum originem an a sensibus solum, ut Gassendo et Lockio nostrati, cseterisque plurimis visum est, an aliunde, hujus loci non est inquirere.”— (Z)e Spatio Reali, sen Ente Infinito Conamen Mathematico-Metaphysicum. Auctore Josepho Haphson, Reg. Soc. Socio. This tract is annexed to the second edition of a work entitled Analysis JEquationum Universalis. Lond. 1702.) In order to enable my readers more easily to form a judgment on the argument in the text, I must beg leave once more to remind them of the distinction already pointed out between the Gassendists and the Cartesians; the former asserting, that, as all our ideas are derived from the external senses, the intellectual phenomena can admit of no other explanation than what is furnished by analogies drawn from the material world; the latter rejecting these analogies altogether, as de¬ lusive and treacherous lights in the study of mind; and contending, that the exercise of the power of reflection is the only medium through which any knowledge of its operations is to be obtained. To the one or the other of these two classes, all the metaphysicians of the last century may be referred; and even at the present day, the fundamental question which formed the chief ground of controversy between Gassendi and Descartes (I mean the question concerning the proper logical method of studying the mind) still continues the hinge on which the most important disputes relating to the internal world will be found ultimately to turn",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"According to this distinction, Locke, notwithstanding some occasional slips of his pen, belongs indisputably to the class of Cartesians; as well as the very small number of his followers who have entered thoroughly into the spirit of his philo¬ sophy. To the class of Gassendists, on the other hand, belong all those French metaphysicians, who professing to tread in Locke’s footsteps, have derived all their knowledge of the Essay on Human Understanding from the works of Condillac; together with most of the commentators on Locke who have proceeded from the school of Bishop Law.

"A more convenient opportunity will after¬ wards occur for taking some notice of Locke’s writings on Money and Trade, and on the Prin¬ ciples of Government. They appear to me to connect less naturally and closely with the li¬ terary history of the times when they appeared, than with the systematical views which were opened on the same subjects about fifty years afterwards, by some speculative politicians in France and in England. I shall, therefore, de¬ lay any remarks on them which I have to offer till we arrive at the period when the questions to which they relate began everywhere to at¬ tract the attention of the learned world, and to be discussed on those general principles of ex¬ pediency and equity, which form the basis of the modern science of Political Economy. With respect to his merits as a logical and metaphysi¬ cal reformer, enough has been already said for this introductory section : but I shall have oc¬ casion, more than once, to recur to them in the following pages, when I come to review those later theories, of which the germs or rudiments may be distinctly traced in his works; and of which he is, therefore, entitled to divide the praise with such of his successors as have rear¬ ed to maturity the prolific seeds scattered by his hand.1 SECTION II",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Independently of the pre-eminent rank, which the versatile talents and the universal learning of Leibnitz entitle him to hold among the illustrious men who adorned the Continent of Europe during the eighteenth century? there are other considerations which have determin¬ ed me to unite his name with that of Locke, in fixing the commencement of the period, on the history of which I am now to enter. The school of which he was the founder was strong¬ ly discriminated from that of Locke, by the ge¬ neral spirit of its doctrines; and to this school a large proportion of the metaphysicians, and also of the mathematicians of Germany, Hol- 1 And yet with what modesty does Locke speak of his own pretensions as a Philosopher! “ In an age that produces such masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr Newton, it is ambition enough to be employed as an under¬ labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge.”—(Estay on Human Understanding.

On the funda¬ mental question, indeed, concerning the Origin of our Knowledge, the philosophers of the Con¬ tinent (with the exception of the Germans, and a few eminent individuals in other countries) have, in general, sided with Locke, or rather with Gassendi; hut, in most other instances, a partiality for the opinions, and a deference for the authority of Leibnitz, may be traced in their speculations, both on metaphysical and physical subjects. Hence a striking contrast between the characteristical features of the continental philosophy, and those of the contemporary sys¬ tems which have succeeded each other in our own island; the great proportion of our most noted writers, notwithstanding the opposition of their sentiments on particular points, having either attached themselves, or professed to attach themselves, to the method of inquiry recom¬ mended and exemplified by Locke",,"FR,IT",8,"France,Italy","Europe,Europe"
"Some preliminary steps towards such an union had been already taken by Wallis in England, and by Mersenne in France; but the literary commerce, of which they were the centres, was confined almost exclusively to Mathematics and to Physics; while the comprehensive corre¬ spondence of Leibnitz extended alike to every pursuit interesting to man, either as a specu¬ lative or as an active being. From this time forward, accordingly, the history of philosophy involves, in a far greater degree than at any former period, the general history of the human mind; and we shall find, in our attempts to trace its farther progress, our attention more and more irresistibly withdrawn from local de¬ tails to more enlarged views of the globe which we inhabit. A striking change in this literary commerce among nations took place, at least in the western parts of Europe, before the death of Leibnitz; hut, during the remainder of the last century, it continued to proceed with an accelerated rapidity over the whole face of the civilised world. A multitude of causes, un¬ doubtedly, conspired to produce it; hut I know of no individual whose name is better entitled than that of Leibnitz, to mark the era of its commencement.1 I have already, in treating of the philosophy of Locke, said enough, and perhaps more than enough, of the opinion of Leibnitz concerning the origin of our knowledge. Although expressed in a different phraseology, it agrees in the most essential points with the innate ideas of the Car¬ tesians ; hut it approaches still more nearly to some of the mystical speculations of Plato. The very exact coincidence between the language of Leibnitz on this question, and that of his con¬ temporary Cudworth, whose mind, like his own, was deeply tinctured with the Platonic Meta¬ physics, is not unworthy of notice here, as an historical fact; and it is the only remark on this part of his system which I mean to add at pre¬ sent to those in the preceding history",Plato,"FR,CO",8,"France,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"applied by Leibnitz to the mind, which he calls a Spiritual Automaton, I confess myself quite un¬ able to annex a meaning to it: I shall not, there¬ fore, offer any remarks on this part of his sys¬ tem.1 To these visionary speculations of Leibnitz, a strong and instructive contrast is exhibited in the philosophy of Locke ; a philosophy, the main object of which is less to enlarge our knowledge, than to make us sensible of our ignorance; or (as the author himself expresses it) “ to prevail with the busy mind of man to be cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehen¬ sion ; to stop when it is at the utmost extent of its tether; and to sit down in a quiet ignorance of those things, which, upon examination, are found to be beyond the reach of our capacities.”  <c My right hand writes,” says Locke, in another part of his Essay, C{ whilst my left hand is still. What causes rest in one, and motion in the other ? Nothing but my will, a thought of my mind; my thought only changing, my right hand rests, and the left hand moves. This is matter of fact which cannot he denied. Explain this and make it intelligible, and then the next step will be to understand Creation In the meantime, it is an overvaluing ourselves, to re¬ duce all to the narrow measure of our capaci¬ ties ; and to conclude all things impossible to be done, whose manner of doing exceeds our com¬ prehension If you do not understand the operations of your own finite Mind, that think¬ ing thing within you, do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite Mind, who made and governs all things, and whom the heaven of heavens can¬ not contain.”2 3 *—(Yol. II. pp. 249, 250.) This contrast between the philosophical cha¬ racters of Locke and of Leibnitz is the more de¬ serving of notice, as something of the same sort has ever since continued to mark and to discri¬ minate the metaphysical researches of the Eng¬ lish and of the German schools. Various ex¬ ceptions to this remark may, no doubt, be men¬ tioned ; but these exceptions will be found of trifling moment, when compared with the indis¬ putable extent of its general application",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"The theory of pre-established harmony led, by a natural and obvious transition, to the scheme of Optimism. As it represented all events, both in the physical and moral worlds, as the neces¬ sary effects of a mechanism originally contrived and set a-going by the Deity, it reduced its au¬ thor to the alternative of either calling in ques¬ tion the Divine power, wisdom, and goodness, or of asserting that the universe which he had called into being was the best of all possible systems. This last opinion, accordingly, was eagerly embraced by Leibnitz; and forms the subject of a work entitled Theodiccea, in which are combined together, in an extraordinary de¬ gree, the acuteness of the logician, the imagina¬ tion of the poet, and the impenetrable, yet sub¬ lime darkness, of the metaphysical theologian.5 The modification of Optimism, however, adopt¬ ed by Leibnitz, was, in some essential respects, peculiar to himself. It differed from that of Plato, and of some other sages of antiquity, in considering the human mind in the light of a spiritual machine, and, of consequence, in posi- 1 Absurd as the hypothesis of a Pre-established Harmony may now appear, not many years have elapsed since it was the pre vailing, or rather universal creed, among the philosophers of Germany. “II fut un temps” (says the celebrated Euler/ “ ou le systeme de Pharmonie pre-etablie etoit tellement en vogue dans toute PAllemagne, que ceux qui en doutoient, pas- soient pour des ignorans, ou des esprits bornes.”—(Letires de M. Euler d une Princesse d'Allemagne, 83e Lettre.)

"In a note on this sentence, the editor quotes a passage from Bilfinger, a learned German, in which an attempt is made to vindicate the propriety of the phrase, by a reference to the etymology of the word automaton. This word, it is observed, when traced to its source, literally expresses something which contains within itself its principle of motion, and, consequently, it ap¬ plies still more literally to Mind than to a machine. The remark, considered in a philological point of view, is indisputably just; but is it not evident, that it leads to a conclusion precisely contrary to what this author would deduce from it ? What¬ ever may have been the primitive meaning of the word, its common, or rather its universal meaning, even among scientific writers, is, a material machine, moving without any foreign impulse; and, that this was the idea annexed to it by Leibnitz, appears from his distinguishing it by the epithet spirituale, an epithet which would have been altogether superfluous had he intended to convey the opinion ascribed to him by Bilfinger. In applying, therefore, this language to the mind, we may conclude, with confidence, that Leibnitz had no intention to contrast together mind and body, in respect of their moving or actuating principles, but only to contrast them in respect of the substances of which they are composed. In a word, he con¬ ceived both of them to be equally machines, made and wound up by the Supreme Being; but the machinery in the one case to be material, and in the other spiritual",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"p. 135.)* In various other instances, he rises from the deep and seemingly hopeless abyss of Fatalism, to the same lofty conceptions of the universe; and has thus invested the most humiliating article of the atheistic creed, with an air of Platonic mysticism. The influence of his example appears to me to have contributed much to corrupt the taste and to bewilder the speculations of his coun¬ trymen ; giving birth, in the last result, to that heterogeneous combination of all that is pernicious in Spinozism, with the transcendental eccentrici¬ ties of a heated and exalted fancy, which, for many years past, has so deeply tinctured both their philosophy and their works of fiction.5 In other parts of Europe, the effects of the Theo- diccBa have not been equally unfavourable. In France, more particularly, it has furnished to the few who have cultivated with success the Philosophy of Mind, new weapons for combat¬ ing the materialism of the Gassendists and Hob- bists; and, in England, we are indebted to it for the irresistible reasonings by which Clarke sub¬ verted the foundations on which the whole su¬ perstructure of Fatalism rests.4 It may be justly regarded as a proof of the i The following remark in Madame de Stael’s interesting and eloquent review of German philosophy bears marks of e haste and preeipitatmn wuh which her criticisms are seldom chargeable: “ Les opinions de Leibnitz tendent surtout ac l°n.nement nu^a1’ 8 11 ^ vra1’ comme les philosophes Allemands ont tache de le prouver, que le libre arbitre repos du vouloir ” 11111 affianchlt 1 ame des obJets exteneures, et que la vertu ne puisse exister sans la parfaite independanc fnllmvint Charles B™net' V? his work entitled, Contemplation de la Nature, has indulged his imagination so far, in o ing out the above conjecture of Leibnitz, as to rival some of the wildest flights of Jacob Behmen. “ Mais I’e'chelle it npnfn10!1'116 i? t®r“ine.Point,au P*us elevds des mondes planetaires.

", .on0 ot Leibnitz’s controversial discussions with Dr Clarke, there is a passage which throws some light on his taste, not only m matters of science, but in judging of works of imagination. “ Du temps de M. Boyle, et d’autres excellens homines qui lleurissoient en Angleterre sous Charles II. on n’auroit pas ose nous debiter des notions si crenses. (The notions here al¬ luded to are those of Newton concerning the law of gravitation.) J’espcre que le beautemps reviendra sous un aussi bon enu- vernement que celui d a present. Le capital de M. Boyle etoit d’inculquer que tout se faisoit mechaniquement dans la phy¬ sique. Mais c est un malheur des hommes, de se degouter enfin de la raison meme, et de s’ennuyer de la lumiere.

On s’est lasse' des romans raisonnables, tel que la Clelie Francoise ou l Aramene Allemande; et on est revenu depuis quelque temps aux Contes des Fles.""—(Cinquieme Ecrit de M. Leibnitz p. 260.) b rom this passage it would seem, that Leibnitz looked forward to the period, when the dreams of the Newtonian philo¬ sophy would give way to some of the exploded mechanical theories of the universe ; and when the Fairy-tales then in fa¬ shion (among which number must have been included those of Count Anthony Hamilton) would be supplanted by the re¬ vival ot such reasonable Romancesfs the Grand Clelia.

"135 rative anatomy of animals, has been fully de¬ monstrated by Cuvier;1 and it is of material consequence to remark, that these exceptions, how few soever, to a metaphysical principle, are not less fatal to its truth than if they exceeded in number the instances which are quoted in sup¬ port of the general rule.* At a period somewhat later, an attempt has been made to connect the same law of continuity with the history of human improvement, and more particularly with the progress of invention in the sciences and arts. Helvetius is the most noted writer in whom I have observed this last extension of the Leibnitzian principle; and I have little doubt, from his known opinions, that, when it occurred to him, he conceived it to af¬ ford a new illustration of the scheme of necessi¬ ty, and of the mechanical concatenation of all the phenomena of human life. Arguing in sup¬ port of his favourite paradox concerning the ori¬ ginal equality of all men in point of mental capa¬ city, he represents the successive advances made by different individuals in the career of discovery, as so many imperceptible or infinitesimal steps, each individual surpassing his predecessor by a trifle, till at length nothing is wanting but an additional mind, not superior to the others in natural powers, to combine together, and to turn to its own account, their accumulated la¬ bours. <c It is upon this mind,” he observes, il that the world is always ready to bestow the attribute of genius. From the tragedies of The Passion, to the poets Hardy and Rotrou, and to the Mariamne of Tristan, the French theatre was always acquiring successively an infinite number of inconsiderable improvements. Cor¬ neille was horn at a moment, when the addition he made to the art could not fail to form an epoch; and accordingly Corneille is universally regarded as a Genius. I am far from wishing,” Helvetius adds, “ to detract from the glory of this great poet. I wish only to prove, that Na¬ ture never proceeds per saltum, and that the Law of Continuity is always excwtly observed. The re¬ marks, therefore, now made on the dramatic art, may also be applied to the sciences which rest on observation.”5—(De VEsprit, His. IV",,FR,8,France,Europe
"2 While Bonnet was thus employing his ingenuity in generalising, still farther than his predecessors had done, the law of continuity, one of the most distinguished of his fellow citizens, with whom he appears to have been connected in the closest and most confidential friendship (the very ingenious M. Le Sage), was led, in the course ol his researches concerning^ the physical cause of gravitation, to deny the existence of the law, even in the descent of heavy bodies. “ The action ot gravity (according to him) is not continuous.” In other words, “ each of its impressions is finite; and the interval or time which separates it from the following impression is of a finite duration.” Of this proposition he offers a proof, which he considers as demonstrative; and thence deduces the following very paradoxical corollary, That “ Projectiles do not move in curvilinear paths, but in rectilinear polygons.” *—“ C’est ainsi (he adds) qu’un prds, qui yu de pres, se trouve couvert de parties vertes reellement separees, offre cependant aux personnes qui le regardent de loin, la sensation dune verdure continue : Et qu’un corps poli, auquel le microscope decouvre mille solutions de continuite, paroit a I’oeil nu, posseder une continuity parfaite.” . ' , “ Ge'ndralement, le simple bons sens, qui veut, qu’on suspende son jugement sur ce qu’on ignore, et que 1 on ne tranche pas hardiment sur la non-existence de ce qui echappe a nos sens, auroit du empecher des gens qui s’appelloient phxlosophes de decider si dogmatiquement, la continuite reelle, de ce qui avoit une continuity apparente ; et la non-existenar des. m- tervalles qu’ils n’apercevoient pas.”—fEssai de Chymie Mecanique.

It would have been difficult to have named any other modern poet, in whose works, when compared with those ol his immediate predecessors, the Law of Continuity has been more remarkably violated. “Corneille (says a most judicious French critic) est, pour ainsi dire, de notre terns; mais ses contemporains n’en sont pas. Le Cid, les Horaces, Cinna, o- lieucte, forment le commencement de cette chaine brillante qui reunit notre litterature actuelle de celle du regne e ic e- lieu et de la minority de Louis XIV.; mais autour de ces points lumineux regne encore une nuit profonde ; leur eclat les rapproche en apparence de nos yeux; le reste, repousse dans Pobscurity, semble bien loin de nous.

"It would be improper to close these reflections on the philosophical speculations of Leibnitz, without taking some notice of his very ingenious and original thoughts on the etymological study of languages, considered as a guide to our con¬ clusions concerning the origin and migrations of different tribes of our species. These thoughts were published in 1710, in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy; and form the first article of the first volume of that justly celebrated collec¬ tion. I do not recollect any author of an ear¬ lier date, who seems to have been completely aware of the important consequences to which the prosecution of this inquiry is likely to lead ; nor, indeed, was much progress made in it by any of Leibnitz’s successors, till towards the end of the last century; when it became a favourite object of pursuit to some very learned and inge¬ nious men, both in France, Germany, and Eng¬ land. Now, however, when our knowledge of the globe, and of its inhabitants, is so wonder¬ fully enlarged by commerce, and by conquest; and when so great advances have been made in the acquisition of languages, the names of which, till very lately, were unheard of in this quarter of the world;—there is every reason to hope for a series of farther discoveries, strengthening pro¬ gressively, by the multiplication of their mutual points of contact, the common evidence of their joint results; and tending more and more to dissipate the darkness in which the primeval history of our race is involved. It is a field, of which only detached corners have hitherto been explored; and in which, it may be confidently presumed, that unthought of treasures still lie hid, to reward sooner or later the researches of our posterity.2 My present subject does not lead me to speak of the mathematical and physical researches, 1 Locke has fallen into a train of thought very similar to that of Bonnet, concerning the Scale of Beings; but has ex¬ pressed himself with far greater caution ;—stating it modestly as an inference deduced from an induction of particulars, not as the result of any abstract or metaphysical principle.—(See Locke’s Works, Vol. III. p. 101.) In one instance, indeed, he avails himself of an allusion, which, at first sight, may appear to favour the extension of the mathematical Law of Continuity to the works of creation ; but it is evident, from the context, that he meant this allusion merely as a popular illustration of a fact in Natural History ; not as the rigorous enunciation of a theorem applicable alike to all truths, mathematical, physi¬ cal, and moral. “ It is a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin, and where insensible and irrational end ; and who is there quick-sighted enough to determine precisely, which is the lowest species of living things, and which is the first of those who have no life ? Things, as far as we can observe, lessen and augment, as the quantity does in a regular cone, where, though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance, yet the difference between the upper and under, where they touch one another, is hardly discernible.” {Ibid.)

"wltichhave associated so closely tlie name of Leib¬ nitz with that of Newton, in the history of modern science; of the inexhaustible treasures of his erudition, both classical and scholastic ; of his vast and manifold contributions towards the elucidation of German antiquities and of Roman jurisprudence ; or of those theological controver¬ sies, in which, while he combated with one hand the enemies of revelation, he defended, with the other, the orthodoxy of his own dogmas against the profoundest and most learned divines of Eu¬ rope. Nor would I have digressed so far as to allude here to these particulars, were it not for the unparalleled example they display, of what a vigorous and versatile genius, seconded by habits of persevering industry, may accomplish, within the short span of human life. Even the relaxations with which he was accustomed to fill up his moments of leisure, partook of the general character of his more serious engagements. By early and long habit, he had acquired a singular facility in the composition of Latin verses; and he seems to have delighted in loading his muse with new fetters of his own contrivance, in ad¬ dition to those imposed by the laws of classical prosody.1 The number, besides, of his literary correspondents was immense ; including all that was most illustrious in Europe : and the rich materials everywhere scattered over his letters are sufficient of themselves to show, that his amusements consisted rather in a change of ob¬ jects, than in a suspension of his mental activi¬ ty. Yet while we admire these stupendous mo¬ numents of his intellectual'energy, we must not forget (if I may borrow the language of Gibbon) that “ even the powers of Leibnitz were dissipat¬ ed by the multiplicity of his pursuits. He at¬ tempted more than he could finish; he designed more than he could execute; his imagination was too easily satisfied with a bold and rapid glance on the subject which he was impatient to leave ; and he may be compared to those heroes L37 whose empire has been lost in the ambition of universal conquest.”* From some expressions which Leibnitz has occasionally dropped, I think it probable, that he himself became sensible, as he advanced in life, that his time might have been more pro¬ fitably employed, had his studies been more con¬ fined in their aim. “ If the whole earth (he has observed on one occasion) had continued to be of one language and of one speech, human life might be considered as extended beyond its pre¬ sent term, by the addition of all that part of it which is devoted to the acquisition of dead and foreign tongues. Many other branches of know¬ ledge, too, may, in this respect, be classed with the languages; such as Positive Laws, Cere¬ monies, the Styles of Courts, and a great pro¬ portion of what is called critical erudition. The utility of all these arises merely from opinion; nor is there to be^found, in the innumerable volumes that have been written to illustrate them, a hundredth part, which contains any¬ thing subservient to the happiness or improve¬ ment of mankind.” The most instructive lesson, however, to be drawn from the history of Leibnitz, is the in¬ competency of the most splendid gifts of the un¬ derstanding, to advance essentially the interests either of Metaphysical or of Ethical Science, un¬ less accompanied with that rare devotion to truth, which maybe regarded, if not as the basis, at least as one of the most indispensable elements, of mo¬ ral genius. The chief attraction to the study of philosophy, in his mind, seems to have been (what many French critics have considered as a chief source of the charms of the imitative arts) the pride of conquering difficulties: a feature of his character which he had probably in his own eye, when he remarked (not without some de¬ gree of conscious vanity), as a peculiarity in the turn or cast of his intellect, that to him “ all difficult things were easy, and all easy things 1 A remarkable instance of this is mentioned by himself in one of his letters. “ Annos natus tredecim una die trecentos versus hexametros effudi, sine elisione omnes, quod hoc fieri facile posse forte affirmassem.” (Leib. Op. Tom. V. p. 304.) He also amused himself occasionally with writing verses in German and in French","Newton, Roman","DE,FR,US,RO",8,"Germany,France,United States,Romania","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"
"difficult.”1 Hence the disregard manifested in his writings to the simple and obvious conclu¬ sions of experience and common sense; and the perpetual effort to unriddle mysteries over which an impenetrable veil is drawn. “ Scilicet su¬ blime et erectum ingenium, pulehritudinem ac speciem excelsse magnseque gloria? vehementius quam caute appetebat.” It is to he regretted, that the sequel of this fine eulogy does not equal¬ ly apply to him. “ Mox mitigavit ratio et eetas; retinuitque, quod est difficillimum, et in sapientia modum.” 2 How happily does this last expression characterise the temperate wisdom of Locke, when contrasted with that towering, but impo¬ tent ambition, which, in the Theories of Opti¬ mism and of Pre-established Harmony, seemed to realize the fabled revolt of the giants against the sovereignty of the gods ! After all, a similarity may be traced between these two great men in one intellectual weakness common to both; a facility^n the admission of facts, stamped sufficiently (as we should now think) by their own intrinsic evidence, with the marks of incredibility. The observation has been often made with respect to Locke; hut it would be difficult to find in Locke’s writings, any thing so absurd as an account gravely trans¬ mitted by Leibnitz to the Abbe de St Pierre, and by him communicated to the Royal Acade¬ my of Sciences at Paris, of a dog who spoke.5 No person liberally educated could, I believe, be found at present in any Protestant country of Christendom, capable of such credulity. By what causes so extraordinary a revolution in the minds of men has been effected, within the short space of a hundred years, I must not here stop to inquire. Much, I apprehend, must be ascribed to our enlarged knowledge of nature, and more particularly to those scientific voyages and tra¬ vels which have annihilated so many of the prodigies which exercised the wonder and sub¬ dued the reason of our ancestors. But, in what¬ ever manner the revolution is to he explained, there can be no doubt that this growing dispo¬ sition to weigh scrupulously the probability of alleged facts against the faith due to the testi¬ monies brought to attest them, and, even in some cases, against the apparent evidence of our own senses, enters largely and essentially into the composition of that philosophical spirit or temper, which so strongly distinguishes the eighteenth century from all those which preced¬ ed it.4 It is no small consolation to reflect, that some important maxims of good sense have been thus familiarised to the most ordinary un¬ derstandings, which, at so very recent a period, failed in producing their due effect on two of the most powerful minds in Europe","Paris, Much","US,DE",8,"United States,Germany","North America,Europe"
"2 In conformity to the plan announced in the preface to this Dissertation, I confine myself to those authors whose opinions have had a marked and general influence on the subsequent history of philosophy; passing over a multitude of other names well worthy to be recorded in the annals of metaphysical science. Among these, I shall only mention the name of Boyle, to whom the world is indebted, beside some very acute remarks and many fine illustrations of his own upon metaphysical questions of the highest moment, for the philosophical arguments in defence of religion, which have added so much lustre to the names of Derham and Bentley ; and, far above both, to that of Clarke.* The remarks and illustrations, which I here refer to, are to be found in his Inquiry into the Vulgar Notion of Nature, and in his Essay, inquiring whether, and how, a Natu¬ ralist should consider Final Causes. Both of these tracts display powers which might have placed their author on a level with Descartes and Locke, had not his taste and inclination determined him more strongly to other pursuits. I am inclined to think, that neither of them is so well known as were to be wished. I do not even recollect to have seen it anywhere no¬ ticed, that some of the most striking and beautiful instances of design in the order of the material world, which occur in the Sermons preached at Boyle’s Lecture, are borrowed from the works of the founder, -f- Notwichstanoing, however, these great merits, he has written too little on such abstract subjects to entitle him to a place among English metaphysicians; nor has he, like Newton, started any leading thoughts which have since given a new direc¬ tion to the studies of metaphysical inquirers. From the slight specimens he has left, there is reason to conclude, that his mind was still more happily turned than that of Newton, for the prosecution of that branch of science to which their con¬ temporary Locke was then beginning to invite the attention of the public","Bentley, Newton, Newton","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"2 This Scholium, it is to be observed, first appeared at the end of the second edition of the Pnncipta, printed at Cambridge in 1713. The'former edition, published at London in 1687, has no Scholium annexed to it. From a passage, however, in a letter of Newton’s to Dr Bentley (dated 1692), it seems probable, that as far back, at least, as that period, he had tnoughts of attempting a proof a priori of the existence of God. After some new illustrations, drawn from his own discoveries, of the common argument from final causes, he thus concludes : “ There is yet another argument for a Deity, which I take to be a very strong one; but, till the principles on which it is grounded are better received, I think it more advisable to let it sleep.” (l'our Letters from Sir I. Newton to Dr Bentley, p. 11. London, Dodsley, 1756.) It appears from this passage, that Newton had no intention, like his predecessor Ilescartes, to supersede, by any new ar¬ gument of his own for the existence of God, the common one drawn from the consideration of final causes;^, therefore, nothing could be more uncandid than the following sarcasm pointed by Pope at the laudable attempts of his two country¬ men to add to the evidence of this conclusion, by deducing it from other principles: “ Let others creep by timid steps and slow, On plain experience lay foundations low, By common sense to common knowledge bred","Cambridge, London, Newton, Newton, London, Newton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"It would be superfluous to dwell longer on the history of these speculations, which, what¬ ever value they may possess in the opinion of persons accustomed to deep and abstract rea¬ soning, are certainly not well adapted to ordi¬ nary or to uncultivated understandings. This consideration furnishes, of itself, no slight pre¬ sumption, that they were not intended to be the media by which the bulk of mankind were to be led to the knowledge of truths so essential to human happiness; and, accordingly, it was on this very ground, that Bishop Butler, and Dr Francis Hutcheson, were induced to strike into a different and more popular path for establish- 1 The question concerning the necessary existence of Space and of Time formed one of the principal subjects of discus¬ sion between Clarke and Leibnitz. According to the former, space and time are, both of them, infinite, immutable, and indestructible. According to his antagonist, “ space is nothing but the order of things co-existing,” and “ time nothing but the order of things successive !” The notion of real absolute Space, in particular, he pronounces to be a mere chimera and superficial imagination ; classing it with those prejudices which Bacon called idola tribus—(See his 4th Paper, § 14.) It has always appeared to me a thing quite inexplicable, that the great majority of philosophers, both in Germany and in France, have, on the above question, decided in favour of Leibnitz. Even D’Alembert himself, who, on most metaphy¬ sical points, reasons so justly and so profoundly, has, in this instance, been carried^along by the prevailing opinion (or, per¬ haps, it would be more correct to say, by the fashionable phraseology) among his countrymen. “ Y auroit-il un espace, s’il n’y avoit point de corps, et une duree s’il n’y avoit rien ?

"Spinoza,5 it may be proper to mention, was an Amsterdam Jew of Portuguese extraction, who (with a view probably to gain a more favourable reception to his philosophical dogmas) withdrew himself from the sect in which he had been edu¬ cated, and afterwards appears to have lived chiefly in the society of Christians;4 without, however, making any public profession of the Christian faith, or even submitting to the cere¬ mony of baptism. In his philosophical creed, he at first embraced the system of Descartes, 1 In speaking disrespectfully of the personal character of Hobbes, I allude to the base servility of his political principles, and to the suppleness with which he adapted them to the opposite interests of the three successive governments under which his literary life was spent.

"2 Dr Reid’s opinion on this point coincides exactly with that of Clarke. See his Essays on the Active Powers o] Man, (p. 289, 4to. Edition), where he pronounces the system of Spinoza to be “ the genuine, and the most tenable system of ne¬ cessity.” 5 Born 1632, died 1677- It is observed by Bayle, that “ although Spinoza was the first who reduced Atheism to a sys¬ tem, and formed it into a body of doctrine, connected according to the method of geometricians, yet, in other respects, his opinion is not new, the substance of it being the same with that of several other philosophers, both ancient and modern, European and Eastern.”—See his Diet. art.

"It is asserted by a late German writer, that “ Spinoza has been little heard of in England, and not at all in France, and that he has been zealously defended and attacked by Germans alone.” The same writer informs us, that “ the philosophy of Leibnitz has been little studied in France, and not at all in England.”—(Lectures on the History of Literature, by Fred Schlegel. English Transl. published at Fdin. 1818. Vob II. p. 243.) Is it possible that an author who pronounces so dogmatically upon the philosophy of England, should never have heard the name of Dr Clarke ? 4 The Synagogue were so indignant at his apostacy, that they pronounced against him their highest sentence of excom- munication called Schammata. The form of the sentence may be found in the Treatise of Selden, De Jure Naturae et Gentium, Lib. IV. c. 7. It is a document of some curiosity, and will scarcely suffer by a comparison with the Popish form of ex- communication recorded by Sterne.

"145 and began his literary career with a work en¬ titled, Renati Descartes Principiorum Philoso¬ phic, Pars Prima et Secunda, More Geometrico Demonstrate, 1663. It was, however, in little else than his physical principles that he agreed with Descartes; for no two philosophers ever differed more widely in their metaphysical and theological tenets. Fontenelle characterises his system as a {< Cartesianism pushed to extra¬ vagance” (une Cartesianisme outree) ; an expres¬ sion which, although far from conveying a just or adequate idea of the whole spirit of his doctrines, applies very happily to his boldness and pertinacity in following out his avowed principles to the most paradoxical consequences which he conceived them to involve. The re¬ putation of his writings, accordingly, has fallen entirely (excepting perhaps in Germany and in Holland) with the philosophy on which they were grafted; although some of the most ob¬ noxious opinions contained in them are still, from time to time, obtruded on the world, un¬ der the disguise of a new form, and of a phra¬ seology less revolting to modern taste.1 2 3 * In no part of Spinoza’s works has he avowed himself an atheist; hut it will not be disputed, by those who comprehend the drift of his rea¬ sonings, that, in point of practical tendency, Atheism and Spinozism are one and the same","Secunda, Holland","DE,ZA,US",8,"Germany,South Africa,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"The diversity of opinions entertained concerning the nature of Spinozism has been chiefly owing to this, that some have formed their notions of it from the books which Spinoza published during his life, and others from his posthumous re¬ mains. It is in the last alone (particularly in his Ethics) that his system is to be seen completely unveiled and undisguis¬ ed. In the former, and also in the letters’ addressed to his friends, he occasionally accommodates himself, with a very tem¬ porising spirit, to what he considered as the prejudices of the world. In proof of this, see his Tractatus rheologico-Politicus, and his epistolary correspondence, passim; above all, his letter to a young friend who had apostatised from Protestantism to the Catholic Church. The letter is addressed, “ Nobilissimo Juveni, Alberto Burgh.""—(Spin. Op. T. II. p. 095.)

"sented, or, at least, very generally misunder¬ stood ; a thing not to he wondered at, consider¬ ing the total neglect into which his works have long fallen. It is only in this way I can ac¬ count for the frequent use which has most un¬ fairly been made of the term Spinozism to stig¬ matise and discredit some doctrines, or rather some modes of speaking, which have been sanc¬ tioned, not only by the wisest of the ancients, hut by the highest names in English philosophy and literature; and which, whether right or wrong, will he found, on a careful examina¬ tion and comparison, not to have the most dis¬ tant affinity to the absurd creed with which they have been confounded. I am afraid that Pope, in the following lines of the Dunciad, suffered himself so far to be misled by the ma¬ lignity of Warhurton, as to aim a secret stab at Newton and Clarke, by associating their figu¬ rative, and not altogether unexceptionable lan¬ guage, concerning space (when they called it the sensorium of the Deity), with the opinion of Spinoza, as I have just explained it.1 “ Thrust some Mechanic Cause into His place, Or bind in matter, or diffuse in space."" Dr Clarke long ago remarked, that “ Believing too much and too little have commonly the luck to meet together, like two things moving contrary ways in the same circle.”—(Third Letter to Dodwell.) A late German writer, who, in his own opinions, has certainly no leaning towards Spinozism, has yet spoken of the mo¬ ral tendency of Spinoza’s writings, in terms of the warmest praise. “ The morality of Spinoza (says M. b red. Schlegel) is not indeed that of the Bible, for he himself was no Christian, but it is still a pure and noble morality, resembling that of the ancient Stoics, perhaps possessing considerable advantages over that system. That which makes him strong when op¬ posed to adversaries who do not understand or feel his depth, or who unconsciously have fallen into errors not much diffe¬ rent from his, is not merely the scientific clearness and decision of his intellect, but in a much higher degree the openhearted¬ ness, strong feeling, and conviction, with which all that he says seems to gush from his heart and soul.’ —(Led. of Fred",Newton,"US,UK,DE",8,"United States,N/A,Germany","North America,N/A,Europe"

"* Mr Gibbon, in commenting upon the celebrated lines of Virgil, “ Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus, “ Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet,” observes, that “ the mind which is infused into the different parts of matter, and which mingles itself with the mighty mass, scarcely retains any property of a spiritual substance, and bears too near an affinity to the principles which the im¬ pious Spinoza revived rather than invented.” He adds, however, that “ the poverty of human language, and the obscu¬ rity of human ideas, make it difficult to speak worthily of the great first cause ; and that our most religious, poets (particularly Pope and Thomson), in striving to express the presence and energy of the Deity in every part of the universe, deviate unwarily into images which require a favourable construction. But these writers (he candidly remarks) deserve that favour, by the sublime manner in which they celebrate the Great Father of the universe, and by those effusions of love and gratitude which are inconsistent with the materialist’s system.”—{Misc. Works, Vol. II. pp. 509,. 510.) May I be permitted here to remark, that it is not only difficult but impossible to speak of the omnipresence and omnipo¬ tence of God, without deviating into such images ? With the doctrine of the Anima Mundi, some philosophers, both ancient and modern, have connected another theory, according to which the souls of men are portions of the Supreme Being, wdth whom they are re-united at death, and in whom they are finally absorbed and lost. To assist the imagination in conceiving this theory, death has been, compared to the breaking of a phial of water, immersed in the ocean. It is needless to say, that this incomprehensible jargon has no necessary connection with the doctrine which represents God as the soul of the world, and that it would have been loudly disclaimed, not only by Pope and Thomson, but by Epictetus, Antoninus, and all the wisest and soberest of the Stoical school. Whatever objections, therefore, may be made to this doctrine, let not its supposed consequences be cnxigea upon any but those who may expressly avow them. On such a subject, as Gibbon has well remarked, “ we should be slow to suspect, and still slower to condemn.”—(/6id. p. 510.) Sir William Jones mentions a very curious modification of this theory of absorption, as one ot the doctrines of the Vedanta school. “ The Vedanta school represent Elysian happiness as a total absorption, though not such as to destroy consciousness, in the Divine Essence.”—(Dissertation on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India.) 148 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",,"GR,IT,IN",8,"Greece,Italy,India","Europe,Europe,Asia"
"May I he permitted to observe farther on this head, that, as one of these writers spent his life in the pay of a German prince, and as the other was the favourite philosopher of another sovereign, still more illustrious, the sentiments which they were so anxious to proclaim to the world, may he presumed to have been not very offensive, in their judgments, to the ears of their protectors ? “ All that is must be (says the Baron de Grimm, addressing himself to the Duke of Saxe- Gotha)—all that is must be, even because it is ; this is the only sound philosophy; as long as we do not know this universe a 'priori (as they sav in the schools), all is necessity.1 Liberty is a word without meaning, as you shall see in the letter of M. Diderot.” The following passage is extracted from Di¬ derot’s letter here referred to : “ I am now, my dear friend, going to quit the tone of a preacher, to take, if I can, that of a philosopher.

XII. p. 100.) _ , c „ In the judgment of Gibbon, “ Bavle’s learning was chiefly confined to the Latin authors ; and he had more of a certain multifarious reading than of real erudition.

"Fontenelle was a nephew of the great Cor¬ neille ; but his genius was, in many respects, very strongly contrasted with that of the author of the Cid. Of this he has himself enabled us to judge by the feeble and unsuccessful attempts in dramatic poetry, by which he was first known to the world. In these, indeed, as in all his productions, there is an abundance of ingenu¬ ity, of elegance, and of courtly refinement; but not the faintest vestige of the mens divinior, or of that sympathy with the higher and nobler passions which enabled Corneille to re-animate and to reproduce on the stage the heroes of an¬ cient Rome. The circumstance, however, which more peculiarly marks and distinguishes his writings, is the French mould in which education and habit seem to have recast all the original features of his mind;—identifying, at the same time, so perfectly the impressions of art with the workmanship of nature, that one would think the Parisian, as well as the man, had started fresh and finished from her creative hand. Even in his Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, the dry discussions with the Marchioness about the now forgotten vortices of Descartes, are en¬ livened throughout by a never-failing spirit of light and national gallantry, which will for ever render them an amusing picture of the manners of the times, and of the character of the author.

"“ If languages had been the work of philosophers, they might certainly be more easily learned. Philosophers would have established everywhere a systematical uniformity, which would have proved a safe and infallible guide ; and the man- ner of forming a derivative word, would, as a necessary consequence, have suggested its signification. The uncivilised nations, who are the first authors of languages, fell naturally into that notion with respect to certain terminaiions, all of which have some common property or virtue; but that advantage, unknown to those who had it in their hands, was not carried to a sufficient extent.” * From this praise, however, must be excepted, the mysterious jargon in which (after the example of some of his con¬ temporaries) he has indulged himself in speaking of the geometry and calculus of infinites. “ Nous le disons avec peine (says D’Alembert), et sans vouloir outrager les manes d’un homme cdlebre qui n’est plus, il n’y a peut-etre point d’ouvrage oil Ton trouye des preuves plus frdquentes de Tabus de la metaphysique, que dans Touvrage tres connu de M.

Sciences which had long been immured in colleges and cloisters, began at length to breathe the ventilated and wholesome air of social life. The union of phi¬ losophy and the fine arts, so much boasted of in the schools of ancient Greece, seemed to promise a speedy and invigorated revival. Geometry, Mechanics, Physics, Metaphysics, and Morals, became objects of pursuit in courts and in camps ; the accomplishments of a scholar grew more and more into repute among the other characteristics of a gentleman : and (what was of still greater importance to the world) the learned discovered the secret of cultivating the graces of writing, as a necessary passport to truth, in a refined but dissipated age",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"Nor was this change of manners confined to one of the sexes. The other sex, to whom na¬ ture has entrusted the first development of our intellectual and moral powers, and who may, therefore, be regarded as the chief medium through which the progress of the mind is con¬ tinued from generation to generation, shared also largely in the general improvement. Fontenelle aspired above all things to be the philosopher of the Parisian circles; and certainly contributed not a little to diffuse a taste for useful know¬ ledge among women of all conditions in France, by bringing it into vogue among the higher classes. A reformation so great and so sudden could not possibly take place, without giving birth to much affectation, extravagance, and folly; but the whole analogy of human affairs encourages us to hope, that the inconveniencies and evils connected with it will be partial and temporary, and its beneficial results permanent and progressive.2 Among the various moral defects imputed to Fontenelle, that of a complete apathy and in- avec une simplicity plus ytudi^e: car la simplicity peut Petre, et des lors elle devient maniere, et cesse d’etre modele.” An idea very similar to this is happily expressed by Congreve, in his portrait of Amoret: Coquet and Coy at once her air, Both studied, though both seem neglected: Careless she is with artful care",,FR,8,France,Europe

Among the various other respects in which Fontenelle contributed to the intellectual improvement of his countrymen, it ought to be mentioned, that he was one of the first writers in France who diverted the at tention of metaphysicians from the old topics of scholastic discussion, to a philosophical investigation of the principles of the fine arts. Various original hints upon these subjects are scattered over his works: but the most favourable specimens of his talents for this very delicate species of analysis are to be found in his Dissertation on Pastorals, and in his Theory concerning the Delight we derive from Tragedy.* His speculations, indeed, are not always just and satisfactory; but they are seldom deficient in novelty or re¬ finement. Their principal fault, perhaps, arises from the author’s disposition to carry his refinements too far; in con¬ sequence of which, his theories become chargeable with that sort of sublimated ingenuity which the French epithet Alambique expresses more precisely and forcibly than any word in our language",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Let me add, that both of these eminent men (who may be regarded as the fathers of philosophical criticism in France) were zealous partizans and admirers of the Cartesian metaphysics. It is this critical branch of metaphysical science which, * In the judgment of Mr Hume, “ there is not a finer piece of criticism than Fontenelle’s Dissertation on Pastorals; in which, by a number of reflections and philosophical reasonings, he endeavours to fix the just medium between simplicity and refinement, which is suitable to that species of poetry.” 160 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",,FR,8,France,Europe
"sensibility to all concerns but his own is by far the most prominent.

"The authority, however, of this adventurer, who earned his subsistence by collecting and retail¬ ing, for the amusement of a German Prince, the literary scandal of Paris, is not much to be relied on in estimating a character with which he does not appear to have had any opportunity of becoming personally acquainted; more especially as, during Fontenelle’s long decline, the great majority of men of letters in France were dis¬ posed to throw his merits into the shade, as an acceptable homage to the rising and more dazzling glories of Voltaire.1 It is in the Aca¬ demical Memoirs of D’Alembert and Condorcet (neither of whom can be suspected of any un¬ just prejudice against Voltaire, but who were both too candid to sacrifice truth to party feel¬ ings) that we ought to search for Fontenelle’s real portrait:8 Or rather (if it be true, as Dr Hutcheson has somewhere remarked, that “ men have commonly the good or bad quali¬ ties which they ascribe to mankind”) the most faithful Eloge on Fontenelle himself is to be found in those which he has pronounced upon others",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"While the circle of mental cultivation was thus rapidly widening in France, a similar pro¬ gress was taking place! upon a larger scale, and under still more favourable circumstances, in England.

"From this censure, however, must be excepted the Abbe Dubos, whose Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting is one of the most agreeable and instructive works that can b@ put into the hands of youth. Few books are better calculated for leading their minds gradually from literature to philosophy. The author’s theories, if not alway s profound or just, are in general marked with good sense as well as with ingenuity; and the subjects to which they relate are so peculiarly^ attrac¬ tive, as to fix the attention even of those readers who have but little relish for speculative discussions. “ Ce qui fait la bontdde cet ouvrage (says Voltaire) c’est qu’il n’y a que pen d’erreurs, et beaucoup de re'flexions vraies, nouvelles, et pro- fondes. 11 manque cependant d’ordre et sur-tout de pre'cision ; il auroit pu etre e'crit avec plus de feu, de grace, et d’el£- gance ; mats Vecrivain pense et fait penser.""—(Siecle de Louis XIV.) 1 As to Voltaire himself, it must be mentioned, to his honour, that though there seems never to have been much cordia¬ lity between him and Fontenelle, he had yet the magnanimity to give a place to this Nestor of French literature in his catalogue of the eminent persons who adorned the reign of Louis XIV.: a tribute of respect the more flattering, as it is the single instance in which he has departed from his general rule of excluding from his list the names of all his living con¬ temporaries. Even Fontenelle’s most devoted admirers ought to be satisfied with the liberality of Voltaire’s eulogy, in which, after pronouncing Fontenelle “ the most universal genius which the age of Louis XIV. had produced,” he thus sums up his merits as an author. “ Enfin on 1’a regarde; comme le premier des hommes dans 1’art nouveau de repandre de la lumiere et des graces sur les sciences abstraites, et il a eu du merite dans tous les autres genres qu’il a traites. 'iantde talens ont ete soutenus par la connoissance des langues et de 1’histoire, et il a tie sans contredit au-dessus de tous les sgavans qui n'ont pas eu le don de Vinvention."" * Condorcet has said expressly, that his apathy was confined entirely to what regarded himself; and that he was always an active, though frequently a concealed friend, where his good offices could be useful to those who deserved them. “ On a cru Fontenelle insensible, parce que sachant miiitriser les mouvemens de son ame il se conduisoit d’apres son esprit, toujours juste et toujours sage. D’ailleurs, il avoit consenti sans peine a conserver cette reputation d’insensibilite; il avoit souffert les plaisanteries de ses societe's sur sa froideur, sans chercher a les de'tromper, parce que, bien sur que les vraies amis n’en seroit pas la dupe, il voyoit dans cette reputation un moyen commode de se delivrer des indifferens sans blesser leur amour- propre.” (Eloge de Fontenelle, par Condorcet.) Many of Fontenelle’s sayings, the import of which must have depended entirely on circumstances of time and place un¬ known to us, have been absurdly quoted to his disadvantage, in their literal and most obvious acceptation. “ I hate war (said he), for it spoils conversation.” Can any just inference be drawn from the levity of this convivial sally, against the humanity of the person who uttered it? Or rather, when connected with the characteristical finesse of Fontenelle’s wit, does it not lead to a conclusion precisely opposite ? DISSERTATION FIRST",,FR,8,France,Europe

"The passage (which I have transcribed in a Note) is curious, and seems to me decisive on the subject.2 The misapprehensions of the ancients on this very obscure question will not appear surprising, when it is considered, that forty years after the publication of Berkeley’s Theory of Vision, and sixty years after the date of Locke’s Essay, the subject was so imperfectly understood in France, that Condillac (who is, to this day, very gene¬ rally regarded by his countrymen as the father of genuine logic and metaphysics) combated at great length the conclusions of the English phi¬ losophers concerning the acquired perceptions of sight; affirming that “ the eye judges naturally of figures, of magnitudes, of situations, and of 1 By this excellent judge, Berkeley’s New Theory of Vision is pronounced to be “ one of the finest examples of Philoso¬ phical Analysis that is to be found in our own, or any other language.”—(Essays on Philosophical Subjects.

It must appear evident, besides, to all who have studied the subject, that Locke has, in this passage, enunciated, in terms the most precise and decided, the same general con¬ clusion concerning the effect of constant and early habits, which it was the great object of Berkeley’s Theory of Vision to establish, and which, indeed, gives to that work its chief value, when considered in connection with the Philo¬ sophy of the Human Mind",Berkeley,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

The characters of his speakers are strongly marked and happily contrasted; the illustrations exhibit a singular combination of logical subtlety and of poetical invention; and the style, while it every¬ where abounds with the rich, yet sober colour¬ ings of the author’s fancy, is perhaps superior, in point of purity and of grammatical correct¬ ness, to any English composition of an earlier date.1 The impression produced in England by Berkeley’s Idealism was not so great as might have been expected; but the novelty of his pa¬ radoxes attracted very powerfully the attention of a set of young men who were then prose¬ cuting their studies at Edinburgh, and who formed themselves into a society for the express purpose of soliciting from the author an expla¬ nation of some parts of his theory which seemed to them obscurely or equivocally expressed. To this correspondence the amiable and excellent prelate appears to have given every encourage¬ ment ; and I have been told by the best autho¬ rity, that he was accustomed to say, that his reasonings had been nowhere better understood than by this club of young Scotsmen.2 The in¬ genious Dr Wallace, author of the Discourse on the Numbers of Mankind, was one of the leading members; and with him were associated several other individuals whose names are now well known and honourably distinguished in the learned world. Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, which was published in 1739, affords sufficient evidence of the deep impression which Berkeley’s writings had left upon his mind; and to this juvenile essay of Mr Hume’s may be traced the origin of the most important meta¬ physical works which Scotland has since pro¬ duced","Berkeley, Edinburgh, Berkeley","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"

"Nor was it only in their Physiological Theo¬ ries concerning the nature of the union between soul and body, that these two philosophers agreed. On all the great articles of metaphy¬ sical theology, the coincidence between their conclusions is truly astonishing. Both held the doctrine of Necessity in its fullest extent; and both combined with it a vein of mystical devo¬ tion, setting at defiance the creeds of all esta¬ blished churches. The intentions of both are allowed, by those who best knew them, to have been eminently pure and worthy; but it cannot be said of either, that his metaphysical writings have contributed much to the instruction or to the improvement of the public. On the con¬ trary, they have been instrumental in spreading a set of speculative tenets very nearly allied to that sentimental and fanatical modification of Spinozism, which, for many years past, has pre¬ vailed so much, and produced such mischievous effects in some parts of Germany.1 But it is chiefly by his application of the asso¬ ciating principle to account for all the mental phenomena, that Hartley is known to the world; and upon this I have nothing to add to what I have already stated in another work.—(Phil",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"1 In a letter which I received from Dr Parr, he mentions a treatise of Dr Hartley’s which appeared about a year before the publication of his great work ; to which it was meant by the author to serve as a precursor. Of this rare treatise I liad never before heard. “You will be astonished to hear,” says Dr Parr, “that in this book,, instead of the doctrine of ne¬ cessity, Hartley openly declares for the indifference of the will, as maintained by Archbishop King. ’ We are told by Hartley himself that his notions upon necessity grew upon him while he was writing his observations upon man; but it is curious (as Dr Parr remarks), that in the course of a year, his opinions on so very essential a point should have undei- gone a complete change.

"3 It may appear to some unaccountable, that no notice should have been taken, in this Dissertation, of any French me¬ taphysician during the long interval between Malebranche and Condillac. As an apology for this apparent omission, I beg leave to quote the words of an author intimately acquainted with the history of French literature and philosophy, and emi¬ nently qualified to appreciate the merits of those who have contributed to their progress. “ If we except,” says Mr Adam Smith, in a Memoir published in 1755, “the Meditations of Descartes, I know of nothing in the works of French writers which aspires at originality in morals or metaphysics; for the philosophy of Regius and that of Malebranche are nothing more than the meditations of Descartes unfolded with more art and refinement. But Hobbes, Locke, Dr Mandeville, Lord Shaftesbury, Dr Butler, Dr Clarke, and Mr Hutcheson, each in his own system, all different and all incompatible, have tried to be original, at least in some points. They have attempted to add something to the fund of observations cel",,FR,8,France,Europe
"There is, at the same time, a remarkable coin¬ cidence between some of his views and those of the other two writers. All of the three, while they profess the highest veneration for Locke, have abandoned his account of the origin of our ideas for that of Gassendi; and, by doing so, have, with the best intentions, furnished arms against those principles which it was their com¬ mon aim to establish in the world.1 It is much to he regretted, that by far the greater part of those French writers who have since speculated about the human mind, have acquired the whole of their knowledge of Locke’s philosophy through this mistaken comment upon its fundamental principle. On this subject I have already ex¬ hausted all that I have to offer on the effect of Condillac’s writings; and I flatter myself have sufficiently shown how widely his commentary differs from the text of his author. It is this commentary, however, which is now almost universally received on the Continent as the doctrine of Locke, and which may justly he re¬ garded as the sheet-anchor of those systems which are commonly stigmatised in England with the appellation of French philosophy. Had Condillac been sufficiently aware of the conse¬ quences which have been deduced (and I must add logically deduced) from his account of the origin of our knowledge, I am persuaded, from his known candour and love of truth, that he would have been eager to acknowledge and to retract his error",,FR,8,France,Europe

This branch of science, which the English themselves neglect at present, appears to have been recently transported into France.

"Condillac enlarges on this point at considerable length ; endeavouring to show, that whenever we lose sight of the ana¬ logical origin of a figurative word, we become insensible to one of the chief beauties of language. “ In the word examen, for example, a Frenchman perceives only the proper name of one of our mental operations.

"“ By combining (he adds) all these differences between the nature of man and of beast, we may understand why sensibility and memory, though faculties common to man and to the lower ani¬ mals, are in the latter only sterile qualities.”1 The foregoing passage is translated literally from a note on one of the first paragraphs of the book De VEsprit; and in the sentence of the text to which the note refers, the author trium¬ phantly asks, £C Who can doubt, that if the wrist of a man had been terminated by the hoof of a horse, the species would still have been wander¬ ing in the forest ?” Without attempting any examination of this shallow and miserable theory, I shall content myself with observing, that it is not peculiar to the philosophers of modern France. From the Memorabilia of Xenophon it appears, that it was current among the sophists of Greece; and the answer given it by Socrates is as philosophical and satisfactory as any thing that could possibly be advanced in the present state of the sciences",,"FR,GR",8,"France,Greece","Europe,Europe"

Neither was it his hands, hut his reason, which instructed man in the arts. The hands are only the organs by which the arts are practised.” 3 The contrast, in point of elevation, between the tone of French philosophy, and that of the best heathen moralists, was long ago remarked by Addison; and of this contrast it would be difficult to find a better illustration than the passages which have just been quoted",Addison,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"The disposition of ingenious men to pass sud¬ denly from one extreme to another in matters of controversy, has, in no instance, been more strikingly exemplified than in the opposite theo¬ ries concerning the nature of the brutes, which successively became fashionable in France du¬ ring the last century. While the prevailing creed of French materialists leads to the rejec¬ tion of every theory which professes to discri¬ minate the rational mind from the animal prin¬ ciple of action, it is well known that, hut a few years before, the disciples of Descartes allowed no one faculty to belong to man and brutes in common; and even went so far as to consider the latter in the light of mere machines. To this paradox the author was probably led, partly by his anxiety to elude the objection which the 1 It is not a little surprising that, in the above enumeration, Helvetius takes no notice of the want of language in the lower animals ; a faculty without which, the multiplication of individuals could contribute nothing to the improvement of the species. Nor is this want of language in the brutes owing to any defect in the organs of speech ; as sufficiently appears from those tribes which are possessed of the power of articulation in no inconsiderable degree.

"For if all the sources of our knowledge are to he found in the external senses, how is it possible for the human mind to rise to a conception of the Supreme Being, or to that of any other truth either of natural or of revealed religion ? To this question Gassendi and Condillac, it cannot be doubted, were both able to return an answer, which seemed to themselves abundantly satisfactory. But how few of the multitude are competent to enter into these refined explana¬ tions ? And how much is it to be dreaded, that the majority will embrace, with the general prin¬ ciple, all the more obvious consequences which to their own gross conceptions it seems neces¬ sarily to involve ? Something of the same sort may be remarked in the controversy about the freedom of the human will. Among the multi¬ tudes whom Leibnitz and Edwards have made converts to the scheme of necessity, how com¬ paratively inconsiderable is the number who have acquiesced in their subtle and ingenious attempts to reconcile this scheme with man’s ac¬ countableness and moral agency ? Of the prevalence of atheism at Paris, among the higher classes, at the period of which we are now speaking, the Memoires and Correspondance of the Baron de Grimm afford the most unques¬ tionable proofs.3 His friend Diderot seems to have been one of its most zealous abettors; who, 1 The Abb^ Trublet in the Mercure de Juillet, 1757 (See CEuvres de Fontenelle, Tome II. p. 137.

"8 The Systeme de la Nature (the boldest, if not the ablest, publication of the Parisian atheists) appeared in 1770. It bore on the title-page the name of Mirabaud, a respectable but not very eminent writer, who, after long filling the office of per¬ petual secretary to the French Academy, died at a very advanced age in 1760. (He was chiefly known as the author of very indifferent translations of Tasso and Ariosto.) It is now, however, universally admitted that Mirabaud had no share whatever in the composition of the Systeme de la Nature. It has been ascribed to various authors; nor am I quite certain, that, among those who are most competent to form a judgment upon this point, there is yet a perfect unanimity. In one of the latest works which has reached this country from France (the Correspondance inidite de Galiani, 1818), it seems to be assumed by the editors, as an acknowledged fact, that it proceeded from the pen of the Baron d’Holbach. The Abbe Galiani having remarked, in one of his letters to Madame Epinay, that it appeared to him to come from the same hand with the Christianisme Devoile and the Militaire Philosophe, the editors remark in a note, “ On peut rendre homage a la sagacitd de I’Abbe Galiani. Le Christianisme Devoile est en effet le premier ouvrage philosophique du Baron d’Holbach. C’est en vain que la Biographic Universelle nous assure, d’apres le temoignage de Voltaire, que cet ouvrage est de Damilaville.” Having mentioned the name of Damilaville, I am tempted to add, that the article relating to him in the Biographic Uni- verselle, notwithstanding the incorrectness with which it is charged in the foregoing passage, is not unworthy of the reader’s 182 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",,FR,8,France,Europe

"On this subject many of our English writers have been misled by taking for granted that to speak lightly of final causes is, of itself, sufficient proof of atheism. That this is a very rash as well as uncharitable conclusion, no other proof is necessary than the manner in which final causes are spoken of by Descartes himself, the great object of whose metaphysical writings plainly was, to establish by demonstration the existence of God. The following vindication of this part of the Cartesian philosophy has been lately offered by a French divine, and it may be extended with equal justice to Buffon and many others of Descartes’s successors : “ Quelques au¬ teurs, et particulierement Leibnitz, ont critique cette partie de la doctrine de Descartes; mais nous la croyons irreprochable, si on veut bien 1’entendre, et remarquer que Descartes ne parle que des Fins totales de Dieu. Sans doute, le soleil par exemple, et les etoiles, ont ete faits pour 1’homme, dans ce sens, que Dieu, en les creant, a eu en vue Futilite de I’homme ; et cette utility a ete sa fin. Mais cette utilite a-t-elle ete 1’unique fin de Dieu ? Croit-on qu’en lui attribuant d’autres fins, on affoibliroit la re- connoissance de I’homme, et 1’obligation ou il est de louer et de benir Dieu dans toutes ses oeuvres ? Les auteurs de la vie spirituelle, les plus mystiques meme, et les plus accr^dites, ne 1’ont pas cru.”—(M. 1’Abbe Emery, Editor of the Thoughts of Descartes upon Religion and Mo¬ rals, Paris, 1811, p. TO.) As to the unqualified charge of atheism, which has been brought by some French ecclesiastics against all of their countrymen that have pre¬ sumed to differ from the tenets of the Catholic church, it will be admitted, with large allow¬ ances, by every candid Presbyterian, when it is recollected that something of the same illiberali- ty formerly existed under the comparatively enlightened establishment of England. In the present times, the following anecdote would ap¬ pear incredible, if it did not rest on the unques¬ tionable testimony of Dr Jortin: “ I heard Dr B. say in a sermon, if any one denies the unin¬ terrupted succession of bishops, I shall not scruple to call him a downright atheist. This, when I was young (Jortin adds), was sound, orthodox, and fashionable doctrine.”—(Tracts, Yol. I. p. 486.)2 How far the effects of that false philosophy of which Grimm’s correspondence exhibits so dark and so authentic a picture, were connected with the awful revolution which soon after followed, it is not easy to say. That they contributed greatly to blacken its atrocities, as well as to re¬ volt against it the feelings of the whole Chris¬ tian world, cannot be disputed. The experi¬ ment was indeed tremendous, to set loose the passions of all classes of men from the restraints attention, as it contains some very remarkable marginal notes on the Christianisme Devoile, copied from Voltaire’s own handwriting",Paris,"US,UK,FR",8,"United States,N/A,France","North America,N/A,Europe"
"These speculations, whatever opinion may he formed of their solidity, are certainly as remote as possible from any tendency to atheism, and still less do they partake of the spirit of that philosophy which would level man with the brute creation.

It may he questioned, too, if the authors of this system, by incorporating their ethical views with their political disquisi¬ tions, did not take a more effectual step towards discountenancing the opinions to which they were opposed, than if they had attacked them in the way of direct argument.8 On the metaphysical theories which issued from the French press during the latter half of the last century, I do not think it necessary for me to enlarge, after what I have so fully stated in some of my former publications.

"The excellent writings of M. Prevost, and of M. Begerando, will, it is to he hoped, gradually introduce into France a sounder taste in this branch of philosophy.5 At present, so far as I am acquainted with the state of what is called ! “ Is there no danger that all this may raise somewhat like that levelling spirit, upon atheistical principles, which in the last age, prevailed upon enthusiastic ones ? Not to speak of the possibility, that different sorts of people may unite in it upon these contrary principles.”—(Sermon preached before the House of Lords, January 30, 1741.) As the fatal effects of both these extremes have, in the course of the two last centuries, been exemplified on so gigantic a scale in the two most civilised countries of Europe, it is to be hoped that mankind may in future derive some salutary admonitions from the experience of their predecessors. In the meantime, from that disposition common both to the higher and lower orders to pass suddenly from one extreme to another, it is at least possible that the strong re-action produced by the spirit of impiety during the French He volution may, in the first instance, impel the multitude to something approach¬ ing to the puritanical fanaticism and frenzy of the Cromwellian Commonwealth",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Every body that has children should read it more than once; for though it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity, though his general scheme of education he an impracticable chimera, yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths better expressed than ever they were before, that may be of service to the wisest men. Particularly, I think he has observed children with more attention, knows their mean¬ ing, and the working of their little passions, better than any other writer. As to his religi¬ ous discussions, which have alarmed the world, and engaged their thoughts more than any other parts of his book, I set them all at nought, and wish they had been omitted.”—(Gray’s Works by Mason, Letter 49.) The most valuable additions made by French writers to the Philosophy of the Human Mind are to be found, not in their systematical trea¬ tises on metaphysics, but in those more popu¬ lar compositions, which, professing to paint the prevailing manners of the times, touch occasionally on the varieties of intellectual character. In this most interesting and im¬ portant study, which has been hitherto almost entirely neglected in Great Britain,1 France must be allowed not only to have led the way, but to remain still unrivalled. It would be endless to enumerate names; hut I must not pass over those of Vauvenargues2 and Du- sur la secrete tendance de toutes ces opinions, lea ont soumises a un examen plus severe.

The objects of Dr Reid’s inquiries led him into a totallv different track. . , . . „ . , Among German writers, Leibnitz has occasionally glanced with a penetrating eye at the varieties of genius; and it were to be wished that he had done so more frequently. How far his example has been followed by his countrymen in later times, I am unable to judge, from my ignorance of their language. ^ t _ u A work expressly on this subject was published by a Spanish physician (Huarte) in the seventeenth century.

"185 clos.1 Nor can I forbear to remark, in justice to an author whom I have already very freely censured, that a variety of acute and refined observations on the different modifi¬ cations of genius may be collected from the writings of Helvetius. The soundness of some of his distinctions may perhaps be question¬ ed ; but even his attempts at classification may serve as useful guides to future observers, and may supply them with a convenient nomencla¬ ture, to which it is not always easy to find cor¬ responding terms in other languages. As ex¬ amples of this, it is sufficient to mention the fol¬ lowing phrases: Esprit juste, Esprit borne, Es¬ prit etendu, Esprit fin, Esprit delie, Esprit de lumiere. The peculiar richness of the French tongue in such appropriate expressions (a cir¬ cumstance, by the way, which not unfrequently leads foreigners to overrate the depth of a talka¬ tive Frenchman) is itself a proof of the degree of attention which the ideas they are meant to convey have attracted in that country among the higher and more cultivated classes",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The influence, however, of the philosophical spirit on the general habits of thinking among men of letters in France, was in no instance dis¬ played to greater advantage, than in the nume¬ rous examples of theoretical or conjectural history, which appeared about the middle of last century",,FR,8,France,Europe
"After what has been already said of tbe general tone of French philosophy, it will not appear surprising, that a system so mystical and spiritual as that of Leibnitz never struck its roots deeply in that country. A masterly out¬ line of its principles was published by Madame du Chatelet, at a period of her life when she was an enthusiastic admirer of the author; and a work on such a subject, composed by a lady of her rank and genius, could not fail to pro¬ duce at first a very strong sensation at Paris; but not long after, she herself abandoned the sais si sa conversation n’avait pas meme quelque chose de plus animd, de plus delicat que ses divins ecrits.” And, on a different occasion, he speaks of him thus: “ Doux, sensible, compatissant, il tenait nos ames dans ses mains.

Pour soutenir I’adversite, on n’avoit besoin que de son exemple ; et temoin de Pegalite de son ame, on n’osait etre malheureux avec lui.” See also an eloquent and pathetic tribute to the genius and worth of Vauvenargues, in Voltaire’s Eloge Funtbre de$ Officiers qui sont marts dans la Guerre de 1741",Paris,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"German philosophy, and became a zealous partizan of the Newtonian school. She even translated into French, and enriched with a commentary, the Principia of Newton ; and by thus renouncing her first faith, contributed more to discredit it, than she had previously done to bring it into fashion. Since that time, Leibnitz has had few, if any, disciples in France, al¬ though some of his peculiar tenets have oc¬ casionally found advocates there, among those who have rejected the great and leading doc¬ trines, by which his system is more peculiarly characterised. His opinions and reasonings in particular, on the necessary concatenation of all events, both physical and moral (which accord¬ ed hut too well with the philosophy professed by Grimm and Diderot), have been long incor¬ porated with the doctrines of the French ma¬ terialists, and they have been lately adopted and sanctioned, in all their extent, by an au¬ thor, the unrivalled splendour of whose ma¬ thematical genius may be justly suspected, in the case of some of his admirers, to throw a false lustre on the dark shades of his philosophi¬ cal creed.1 Notwithstanding, however, this important and unfortunate coincidence, no two systems can well be imagined more strongly contrasted on the whole, than the lofty metaphysics of Leibnitz, and that degrading theory concerning the origin of our ideas, which has been fashion¬ able in France since the time of Condillac. In proof of this, I have only to refer to the account of both, which has been already given",Newton,"FR,US,DE",8,"France,United States,Germany","Europe,North America,Europe"
"The same contrast, it would appear, still con¬ tinues to exist between the favourite doctrines of the German and of the French schools. “ In the French empiricism (says a most impartial, as well as competent judge, M. Ancillon), the faculty of feeling, and the faculty of knowing, 1 “ Les £;venemens actuels ont avec les precedens une liaison fondee sur le principe Evident, qu’une chose ne peat pas commence!' d’etre, sans une cause qui la produise.

"187 are one and the same. In the new philosophy of Germany, there is no faculty of knowing, but reason. In the former, taking our departure from individuals, we rise by degrees to ideas, to general notions, to principles. In the latter, beginning with what is most general, or rather with what is universal, we descend to individu¬ al existences, and to particular cases. In the one, what we see, what we touch, what we feel, are the only realities. In the other, nothing is real but what is invisible and purely intellectual.” “ Both these systems (continues M. Ancillon) result from the exaggeration of a sound prin¬ ciple. They are both true and both false in part; true in what they admit, false in what they reject. All our knowledge begins, or ap¬ pears to begin, in sensation; but it does not fol¬ low from this that it is all derived from sensa¬ tion, or that sensation constitutes its whole amount. The proper and innate activity of the mind has a large share in the origin of our re¬ presentations, our sentiments, our ideas. Reason involves principles which she does not borrow from without, which she owes only to herself, which the impressions of the senses call forth from their obscurity, but which, far from owing their origin to sensations, serve to appreciate them, to judge of them, to employ them as instru¬ ments. It would be rash, however, to conclude from hence, that there is no certainty but in reason, that reason alone can seize the mystery of exist¬ ences, and the intimate nat ure of beings, and that experience is nothing but a vain appearance, destitute of every species of reality.”1 With this short and comprehensive estimate of the new German philosophy, pronounced by one of the most distinguished members of the Berlin Academy, I might perhaps be pardoned for dismissing a subject, with which I have, in some of my former publications, acknowledged myself (from my total ignorance of the German language) to be very imperfectly acquainted; but the impression which it produced for a few years in England (more particularly while our intercourse with the Continent was interrupted), makes it proper for me to bestow on it a little more notice in this Dissertation, than I should otherwise have judged necessary or useful",,DE,8,Germany,Europe

Ancillon, Preface, (k Paris, 1809.) The intimacy of M. Ancillon’s literary connections both with France and with Germany entitle his opinions on the respective merits of their philosophi¬ cal systems to peculiar weight. If he anywhere discovers a partiality for either, the modest account which he gives of himself would lead us to expect his leaning to be in favour of his countrymen. “ Placd entre la France et PAllemagne, appartenant a la premiere par la langue dans laquelle je hasarde d’dcrire, a la seconde par ma naissance, mes etudes, mes principes, mes affections, et j’ose le dire, par la couleur de ma pensde, je desirerois pouvoir servir de mediateur litte'raire, ou d’interprete philosophique entre les deux nations.” In translating from M. Ancillon the passage quoted in the text, I have adhered as closely as possible to the words of the original; although I cannot help imagining that I could have rendered it still more intelligible to the English reader by laying aside some of the peculiarities of his German phraseology. My chief reason for retaining these, ivas to add weight to the strictures which a critic, so deeply tinctured with the German habits of thinking and of writing, has offered, on the most prominent faults of the systems in which he had been educated","Kant, Paris","DE,FR,KG,US,UK",8,"Germany,France,Kyrgyzstan,United States,N/A","Europe,Europe,Asia,North America,N/A"
"* My ignorance of German would have prevented me from saying anything of the philosophy of Kant, if the extraor¬ dinary pretensions with which it was at first brought forward in this island, contrasted with the total oblivion into which it soon after very suddenly fell, had not seemed to demand some attention to so wonderful a phenomenon in the literary history of the eighteenth century. My readers will perceive that I have taken some pains to atone for my inability to read Kant’s works in the original, not only by availing myself of the Latin version of Born, but by consulting various com¬ ments on them which have appeared in the English, French, and Latin languages. As commentators, however, and even translators, are not always to be trusted to as unexceptionable interpreters of their authors’ opinions, my chief reliance has been placed on one of Kant’s own compositions in Latin ; his Dissertation De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Prineipiis, which he printed as the subject of a public disputation, when he was candidate for a Professorship in the Uni- 188 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Kant, Kant, Born, Kant","KG,NL,DE,UK,FR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands,Germany,N/A,France","Asia,Europe,Europe,N/A,Europe"

Wolfius, indeed, did not profess to follow implicitly the opinions of his master, and, on some points, laid claim to peculiar ideas of his own; but the spirit of his philosophy is essen¬ tially the same with that of Leibnitz,5 and the particulars in which he dissented from him are too trifling to deserve any notice in the history of literature.4 The high reputation so long maintained by Wolfius in Germany suggested, at different times, to the book-makers at Paris, the idea of intro¬ ducing into France the philosophy which he taught.

"2 The display of method, however, so conspicuous in all the works of Wolfius, will often be found to amount to little more than an aukward affectation of the phraseology and forms of mathematics, in sciences where they contribute nothing to the clearness of our ideas, or the correctness of our reasonings. This affectation, which seems to have been well adapted to the taste of Germany at the time when he wrote, is now one of the chief causes of the neglect into which his writings have fallen. Some of them may still be usefully consulted as dictionaries, but to read them is impossible. They amount to about forty quarto volumes, twenty-three of which are in Latin, the rest in German",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"In his own country the reputation of Wolfius is not yet at an end. In the preface to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, he is called “ Summus omnium dogmaticorum Philosophus.”—(Kantii Opera ad Philosophiarn Criticam, Yol. I. Praef. Auctoris Posterior, p. xxxvi. Latine Yertit. I'red. Born. Lipsiae, 1796.) And by one of Kant’s best commentators his name is advantageously contrasted with that of David Hume: “ Est autem scientifica methodus aut dogmatica, aut sceptica","Kant, Born, Kant","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"Autore Conrado Friderico a Schmidt-Phiseldek. Hafniae, 1796.) To the other merits of Wolfius it may be added, that he was one of the first who contributed to diffuse among his coun¬ trymen a taste for philosophical inquiries, by writing on scientific subjects in the German language. “ Were all Baron Wolf’s other merits disputed, there is one (says Michaelis), which must incontestably be allowed him, his having added a new degree of perfection to the German Tongue, by applying it to philosophy.”—(Dissertation on the Influence of Opinions on Language, &c. English Translation, p. 27-) 3 On the great question of Free Will, Wolfius adopted implicitly the principles of the Theodicaea ; considering man merely in the light of a machine; but (with the author of that work) dignifying this machine by the epithet spiritual. This language, which is still very prevalent among German philosophers, may be regarded as a relic of the doctrines of Leibnitz and of Wolfius ; and affords an additional proof of the difficulty of eradicating errors sanctioned by illustrious and popular names",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"When the system of Pre-established Harmony was first introduced by Wolfius into the University of Halle, it excited an alarm which had very nearly been attended with fatal consequences to the professor. The following anecdote on the subject is told by Euler: “ Lorsque du temps du feu Hoi de Prusse, M. Wolf enseignoit a Halle le systeme de 1’Har- monie Pre-etablie, le Boi s’informa de cette doctrine, qui faisoit grand bruit alors ; et un courtisan repondit a sa Majeste, que tous les soldats, selon cette doctrine, n’etoient que des machines; que quand il en desertoit, c’etoit une suite ndcessaire de leur structure, et qu’on avoit tort par consequent de les punir, comme on 1’auroit si on punissoit une machine pour avoir produit tel ou tel mouvement. Le Hoi se facha si fort sur ce rapport, qu’il donna ordre de chasser M. Wolf de Halle, sous peine d’etre pendu s’il s’y trouvoit au bout de 24 heurs. Le philosophe se refugia alors a Marbourg, oil je lui ai parle peu de temps apres (Lettres a une Princesse d'Allemagne, Lettre 84me.) We are informed by Condorcet, that some reparation was afterwards made for this injustice by Frederic the Great—“ Le lloi de Prusse, qui necroit pas pourtant a 1’Harmonie Pre-etablie, s’est empresse de rendre justice a Wolf des le premier jour de son regne.” 4 Among other novelties affected by Wolfius, was a new modification of the Theory of the Monads. A slight outline of it, but quite sufficient, I should suppose, to gratify the curiosity of most readers, may be found in Euler’s Letters to a German Princess","University, Halle, Halle","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"5 To what was before remarked, of the opposition in matters of philosophy between the taste of the French and that of the Germans, I shall here add a short passage from an author intimately acquainted with the literature of both nations",,FR,8,France,Europe
“ L’ecole Allemande reconnoit Leibnitz pour chef. Son fameux disciple Wolf regna dans les universites pendant pres d'un demi siecle avec une autorite non contestee.

"189 From the time of Wolfius till the philosophy of Kant began to attract general notice, I know of no German metaphysician whose speculations seem to have acquired much celebrity in the learned world.1 Lambert® is perhaps the most illustrious name which occurs during this inter¬ val. As a mathematician and natural philoso¬ pher, his great merits are universally known and acknowledged, but the language in which his metaphysical and logical works were written, has confined their reputation within a compa¬ ratively narrow circle. I am sorry that I can¬ not speak of these from my own knowledge; but I have heard them mentioned in terms of the highest praise, by some very competent judges, to whose testimony I am disposed to give the greater credit, from the singular vein of originality which runs through all his mathe¬ matical and physical publications.3 The Critique of Pure Reason (the most cele¬ brated of Kant’s metaphysical works) appeared in 1781.4 The idea annexed to the title by the author, is thus explained by himself: “ Criti- cam rationis purse non dico censuram librorum et Systematum, sed facultatis rationalis in uni- versum, respectu cognitionum omnium, ad quas, ab omni experientia libera, possit anniti, proinde dijudicationem possibilitatis aut impossibilitatis metaphysices in genere, constitutionemque turn fontium, turn ambitus atque compagis, turn vero terminorum illius, sed cuncta haec ex princi- piis.” ( Kantii, Opera ad Pkilosophiam Criticam., Vol. I. Prsefatio Auctoris Prior, pp. 11, 12.) To render this somewhat more intelligible, I shall subjoin the comment of one of his intimate friends,5 whose work, we are informed by Dr Willich, had received the sanction of Kant him¬ self. “ The aim of Kant’s Critique is no less than to lead Reason to the true knowledge of it¬ self ; to examine the titles upon which it founds the supposed possession of its metaphysical knowledge ; and by means of this examination, to mark the true limits, beyond which it cannot venture to speculate, without wandering into the empty region of pure fancy.” The same author adds, “ The whole Critique of Pure Reason is es¬ tablished upon this principle, that there is a free reason, independent of all experience and sensation.” montrer qu’ils ne sont pas plus propres a satisfaire la raison que le gout.

She adds, however, that they had no school, since none of them attempted to found any system; but they began the war against the doctrines of the Materialists—(Allemagne, Tome III. p. 98.) I am not acquainted with the metaphysical works of any of the three. Those of Hemsterhuis, who wrote wholly in French, were, I understand, first published in a collected form at Paris, in 1792. He was son of the celebrated Greek scholar and critic, Tiberius Hemsterhusius, Profes¬ sor of Latin Literature at Leyden","Kant, Kant, Willich, Kant, Kant, Paris, Kant, Paris","KG,DE,US,FR,GR",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany,United States,France,Greece","Asia,Europe,North America,Europe,Europe"

Un extrait bien fait de cet ouvrage, duquel on e'carteroit ce qui repugne au gout national, exciteroit 1’attention des philosophes, et la porteroit sur une multitude d’obje'ts qu’ils se sont accoutumes a regardgr avec indifference.”—(Pre¬ vost, Tome II. pp. 267, 268.) In the article Lambert, inserted in the twenty-third volume of the Biographic Universelle (Paris 1819), the following ac¬ count is given of Lambert’s logic :—“ Wolf, d’apres quelques indications de Leibnitz, avoit retire de 1’oubli la syllogistique d’Aristote, science que les scholastiques avoient tellement avilie que ni Bacon ni Locke n’avoient ose lui accorder un regard d’inte'ret. II e'toit reserve d Lambert de la montrer sous le plus beau jour et dans la plus riche parure. C’est ce qu’il a fait dans son Novum Organon, ouvrage qui est un des principaux titres de gloire de son auteur.” From the writer of this article (M. Servois) we farther learn, that the Novum Organon of Lambert was translated into Latin from the German ori¬ ginal by a person of the name of Pfleiderer, and that this translation was in the hands of an English nobleman (the late Earl of Stanhope) as lately as 1782. I quote the words of M. Servois, in the hope that they may attract some attention to the manuscript, if it be still in existence. The publication of it would certainly be a most acceptable present to the learned world. “ D’apres le conseil de Le Sage de Geneve, 1’ouvrage fut traduit en Latin par Pfleiderer, aux frais d’un savant Italien; cette traduction passa, on ne sait comment, entre les mains de Milord Mahon, qui la possedoit encore en 1782; on ignore quel est son sort ulterieur.” 4 Kant was born at Koenigsberg, in Prussia, in 1724.

"Reprinted at Neufchatel in 1790.) We are farther told by Buhle, that the attention of the public to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason was first attracted by an excellent analysis of the work, which appeared in the General Gazette of Literature, and by the Letters on Kant's Philosophy, which Reinhold inserted in the German Mercury.—(Buhi.e, Tom. VI. p. 573.) Of this last philosopher, who appears, in the first instance, to have entered with enthusiasm into Kant’s views, and who afterwards contributed much to open the eyes of his countrymen to the radical defects of his system, I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. Degerando, as well as Buhle, bestows high praise not only on his clearness, but on his eloquence, as a writer in his own language. “ II a tra- duit les oracles Kantiens dans une langue elegante, harmonieuse, et pure * * * II a su exprimer avec un langage eloquent, des hides jusqu’alors inintelligibles,” &c—(Histoire Comparte, &c.

In point of perspicuity, he appears to me to be greatly superior to Kant; and of this I conceive myself to be not altogether incompetent to judge, as the Latin versions of both authors are by the same hand","Kant, Kant, Buhi, Of, Kant, Born, Kant","KG,PH,TR,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Philippines,Turkey,Netherlands","Asia,Asia,Asia,Europe"
"2 The following quotation, from the advertisement prefixed to Madame de Stael’s posthumous work (Considerations sur la Revolution Fraiifaise), will at once account to my readers for the confidence with which I appeal to her historical state¬ ments on the subject of Germany philosophy. Her own knowledge of the language was probably not so critically exact, as to enable her to enter into the more refined details of the different systems which she has described ; but her extraordinary penetration, joined to the opportunities she enjoyed of conversing with all that was then most illustrious in Germany, qua¬ lified her in an eminent degree to seize and to delineate their great outlines. And if, in executing this task, any consider¬ able mistakes could have been supposed to escape her, we may be fully assured, that the very accomplished person, to whose revision we learn that her literary labours at this period of her life were submitted, would prevent them from ever meeting the public eye.

"“ The philosophy of sensation,” says Frederick Schlegel, “ which was unconsciously bequeathed to the world by Bacon, and reduced to a methodical shape by Locke, first displayed in France the true immorality and destructiveness of which it is the parent, and assumed the appearance of a perfect system of Atheism.”—(Lectures on the History of Literature, from the German ot Fred. Schlegel. F.din. 1818, Vol. II. p. 22.) It is evident, that the system of Locke is here confounded with that ot Condillac. May not the former be called the philosophy of rejlection, with as great propriety as the philosophy of sensation ? 4 In considering Leibnitz as a partizan of the freedom of the will, Madame de Stael has also followed the views of many German writers, who make no distinction between Materialists and Necessitarians, imagining, that to assert the spiritua¬ lity of the soul, is to assert its free agency- On the inaccuracy of these conceptions it would be superfluous to enlarge, after what was formerly said in treating of the metaphysical opinions of Leibnitz",,"DE,FR",8,"Germany,France","Europe,Europe"

"Willich, M. D. pp. 68, 69, 70.) It is a circumstance not easily explicable, that, in the foregoing historical sketch, no mention is made of the name of Cudworth, author of the treatise on Eternal and Immutable Morality ; a book which could scarcely fail to be known, be¬ fore the period in question, to every German scholar, by the admirable Latin version of it published by Dr Mosheim.1 In this treatise, no necessary connection; Leibnitz, and many other German metaphysicians, denying the latter with no less confidence than that with which they assert the former",Willich,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"There is another word to which Madame de Stael and other writers on the German philosophy annex an idea peculiar to themselves ; I mean the word experimental or empirical. This epithet is often used by them to distinguish what thev call the philosophy of Sensations, from that of Plato and of Leibnitz. It is accordingly generally, if not always, employed by them in an unfavourable sense. In this country, on the contrary, the experimental or inductive philosophy of the hu¬ man mind denotes those speculations concerning mind, which, rejecting all hypothetical theories, rest solely on phenomena for which we have the evidence of consciousness. It is applied to the philosophy of Reid, and to all that is truly valuable in the metaphysical works of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume","Plato, Berkeley","CO,US,DE",8,"Colombia,United States,Germany","South America,North America,Europe"
"Nor are the words, experimental and empirical, by any means synonymous in our language. The latter word is now al¬ most exclusively appropriated to the practice of Medicine ; and when so understood always implies a rash and unphiloso- phical use of Experience. “ The appellation Empiric,” says the late Dr John Gregory, “is generally applied to one who, from observing the effects of a remedy in one case of a disease, applies it to all the various cases of that distemper.” The same remark may be extended to the word Empirique in the French language, which is very nearly synonymous with Charlatan. In consequence of this abuse of terms, the epithet experimental, as well as empirical, is seldom applied by foreign writers to the philosophy of Locke, without being intended to convey a censure",,FR,8,France,Europe
"1 The first edition of this translation was printed as early as 1732. From Buhle’s History of Modern Philosophy (a work which did not fall into my hands till long after this section was written), I find that Cudworth’s Treatise of Immutable Mo¬ rality is now not only well known to the scholars of Germany, but that some of them have remarked the identity of the doctrines contained in it with those of Kant. “ Meiners, dans son histoire generale de PEthique, nie que le systeme morale de Cudworth soit identique avec celui de Platon, et pretend au contraire, ‘ que les principes considerds comme ap- partenans de la mani'ere la plus speciale a la morale de Kant, etaient enseignes il y a deja plusieurs generations par I’ecole du philosophe Anglais.”—{Hist, de la Phil. Moderne, Tom. III. p. 577-) In opposition to this, Buhle states his own decid¬ ed conviction, “ qu’ aucune des idees de Cudworth ne se rapproche de celles de Kant.”—{Ibid.) How far this conviction is well founded, the passage from Cudworth, quoted in the text, will enable my readers to judge for themselves","Kant, Kant, Kant","KG,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany","Asia,Europe"
"Cudworth is at much pains to illustrate the Pla¬ tonic doctrine concerning the difference between sensation and intellection ; asserting that 44 some ideas of the mind proceed not from outward sensible objects, but arise from the inward ac¬ tivity of the mind itselfthat 44 even simple corporeal things, passively perceived by sense, are known and understood only by the active power of the mind and that, besides A/cr^^ara and lavras [Mara, there must he Novara or intel¬ ligible ideas, the source of which can be traced to the understanding alone.1 In the course of his speculations on these sub¬ jects, Cudworth has blended, with some very deep and valuable discussions, several opinions to which I cannot assent, and not a few propo¬ sitions which I am unable to comprehend; hut he seems to have advanced at least as far as Kant, in drawing the line between the provin¬ ces of the senses and of the understanding; and although not one of the most luminous of our English writers, he must he allowed to he far superior to the German metaphysician, both in point of perspicuity and of precision. A later writer, too, of our own country (Dr Price), a zealous follower both of Plato and of Cudworth, afterwards resumed the same argument, in a work which appeared long before the Critique of Pure Reason;2 and urged it with much force against those modern metaphysicians, who con¬ sider the senses as the sources of all our know¬ ledge. At a period somewhat earlier, many very interesting quotations of a similar import had been produced by the learned Mr Harris, from the later commentators of the Alexandrian school on the philosophy of Aristotle; and had been advantageously contrasted by him with the account given of the origin of our ideas, not only by Hobbes and Gassendi, hut by many of the professed followers of Locke. If this part of the Kantian system, therefore, was new in Germany, it certainly could have no claim to the praise of originality, in the estimation of those at all acquainted with English literature.3 In order, however, to strike at the root of what the Germans call the philosophy of sensa- morale de Price pre'sente en effet une analogic frappante avec ceile de Kantand in another part of his work, he expresses himself thus on the same subject: “ Le plus remarquable de tous les moralistes modernes de PAngleterre est, sans con- tredit, Richard Price On remarque 1’analogie la plus frappante entre ses idees sur les bases de lamoralite, et celles que la philosophie critique a fait naitre en Allemagne, quoique il ne soit cependant pas possible d’elever le plus petit doute sur I’entiere originalite de ces dernieres.”—(Tom. V. p. 303.) Is there any thing of importance in the system of Price, which is not borrowed from the Treatise of Immutable Morality ?■ The distinguishing merit of this learned and most respectable writer is the good sense with which he has applied the doctrines of Cudworth to the sceptical theories of his own times","Novara, Kant, Plato","DE,UK,IT,KG,CO",8,"Germany,N/A,Italy,Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Europe,N/A,Europe,Asia,South America"

"Cudworth’s Treatise of Eternal and Immutable Morality, although it appears, from intrinsic evidence, to have been com¬ posed during the lifetime of Hobbes, was not published till 1731, when the author’s manuscript came into the hands of his grandson, Francis Cudworth Masham, one of the Masters in Chancery. This work, therefore, could not have been known to Leibnitz, who died seventeen years before ; a circumstance which may help to account for its having attracted so much less attention in Germany than his Intellectual System, which is repeatedly mentioned by Leibnitz in terms of the highest praise",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"193 lion, it was necessary to trace, with some degree of systematica] detail, the origin of our most important simple notions ; and for this purpose it seemed reasonable to begin with an analytical view of those faculties and powers, to the exer¬ cise of which the development of these notions is necessarily subsequent. It is thus that the simple notions of time and motion presuppose the exercise of the faculty of memory; and that the simple notions of truth, of belief, of doiibt, and many others of the same kind, necessarily presuppose the exercise of the power of reason¬ ing. I do not know, that, in this anatomy of the mind, much progress has hitherto been made by the German metaphysicians. A great deal certainly has been accomplished by the late Dr Reid; and something, perhaps, has been added to his labours by those of his successors",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"According to Kant himself, his metaphysical doctrines first occurred to him while employed in the examination of Mr Hume’s Theory of Causation. The train of thought by which he was led to them will he best stated in his own words ; for it is in this way alone that I can hope to escape the charge of misrepresentation from his followers. Some of his details would perhaps have been more intelligible to my read¬ ers, had my plan allowed me to prefix to them a slight outline of Hume’s philosophy. But this the general arrangement of my discourse ren¬ dered impossible; nor can any material incon¬ venience result, in this instance, from the order which I have adopted, inasmuch as Hume’s Theory of Causation, how new soever it may have appeared to Kant, is fundamentally the same with that of Malebranche, and of a variety of other old writers, both French and English","Kant, Kant","KG,FR,UK",8,"Kyrgyzstan,France,N/A","Asia,Europe,N/A"
"“ Hence, he concluded, that reason entirely deceives herself with this idea, and that she er¬ roneously considers it as her own child, when it is only the spurious offspring of imagination, impregnated by experience; a subjective neces¬ sity, arising from habit and the association of ideas, being thus substituted for an objective one derived from perception....However hasty and unwarrantable Hume’s conclusion might appear, yet it was founded upon investigation; and this investigation well deserved, that some of the philosophers of his time should have united to solve, more happily if possible, the problem in the sense in which he delivered it: A complete reform of the science might have resulted from this solution. But it is a mortifying reflection, that his opponents, Reid, Beattie, Oswald, and, lastly, Priestley himself, totally misunderstood the tendency of his problem.3 The question was not, whether the idea of cause be in itself proper and indispensable to the illustration of all natu- 1 See the Preface of Kant to one of his Treatises, entitled Prolegomena ad Metaphysicam quamque futuram quce qua Scientia poterit prodire.

In the mean time, it will be sufficient to mention here, for the sake of connection, that he denies the objective reality both of time and of space. The former he considers merely as a subjective condition, inseparably connected with the frame of the human mind, in consequence of which, it arranges sensible phenomena ac¬ cording to a certain law, in the order of succes¬ sion. As to the latter, he asserts, that it is nothing objective or real, inasmuch as it is neither 1 This is precisely the language of the German school: “ Les veritds necessaires, “ says Leibnitz, “ sont le produit im- mediat de Tactivite interieure.”—(Tome I. p. 686.

Mais on peut aussi la considerer comme un acte de la liberte raisonnable: Alors elle n’est plus soumise a la loi de la causalite ; elle est inde'pendante de la condition du temps, elle se rapporte a une cause intelligible, la liberte', et elle fait partie du caractere intelligible de I’homme. On ne peut, a la verite, point acquerir la moindre connoissance des objets intelligibles; mais la liberte n’est pas moins un fait de la conscience. Done les actions exterieures sont indifferentes pour la moralite de I’homme.

G. Buble, Tom. YI. pp. 504, 505.) Very nearly to the same purpose is the following statement by the ingenious author of the article Leibnitz in the Bio- graphic Universelle:—“ Comment accorder le fatum et la liberte, I’imputation morale et la dependence des etres finies Kant croit echapper a cet e'cueil en ne soumettant a la loi de causalite (au determinisme de Leibnitz) que le monde pheno- menique, et en affranchissant de ce princijfe 1’ame comme noumcne ou chose en soi, envisageant ainsi chaqiie action comme appartenant a un double serie a la fois; a 1’ordre physique ou elle est enchainde a ce qui precede et a ce qui suit par les liens communs de la nature, et d Pordre morale, ou une determination produit un effet, sans que pour expliquer cette voli¬ tion et son resultat, on soit renvoye a un dtat antecedent.” The author of the above passage is M. Staffer, to whom we are indebted for the article Kant in the same work. For Kant’s own view of the subject consult his Critique of Pure Reason, passim, particularly p. 99. et seq. of Born’s Translation, Vol. III","Kant, Kant, Kant, Born","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"
"That it was Kant’s original aim to establish a system of scepticism, I am far from being dis¬ posed to think.1 The probability is, that be began with a serious wish to refute the doctrines of Hume; and that, in the progress of his in¬ quiries, he met with obstacles of which he was not aware. It was to remove these obstacles that he had recourse to practical reason ; an idea which has every appearance of being an after¬ thought, very remote from his views when he first undertook his work. This, too, would seem, from the following passage (which I trans¬ late from Degerando), to have been the opinion of one of Kant’s ablest German commentators, M. Reinhold: “ Practical Reason (as Reinhold ingeniously observes) is a wing which Kant has prudently added to his edifice, from a sense of the inadequacy of the original design to answer the intended purpose. It bears a manifest re¬ semblance to what some philosophers call an ap¬ peal to sentiment, founding belief on the neces¬ sity of acting. Whatever contempt Kant may affect for popular systems of philosophy, this manner of considering the subject is not unlike the disposition of those who, feeling their inabi¬ lity to obtain, by the exercise of their reason, a direct conviction of their religious creed, cling to it nevertheless with a blind eagerness, as a support essential to their morals and their hap¬ piness.” [Hist. Comparee, Vol. II. pp. 243, 244.) The extraordinary impression produced for a considerable time in Germany, by the Critique of Pure Reason, is very shrewdly, and I suspect justly, accounted for by the writer last quoted: “ The system of Kant was well adapted to flat¬ ter the weaknesses of the human mind. Curio¬ sity was excited, by seeing paths opened which had never been trodden before. The love of mystery found a secret charm in the obscui’ity which enveloped the doctrine. The long and troublesome period of initiation was calculated to rouse the ambition of bold and adventurous spirits. Their love of singularity was gratified by the new nomenclature; while their vanity exulted in the idea of being admitted into a privi¬ leged sect, exercising, and entitled to exercise, the supreme censorship in philosophy. Even men of the most ordinary parts, on finding themselves called to so high functions, lost sight of their real mediocrity, and conceived them¬ selves transformed into geniuses destined to form a new era in the history of reason","Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant, Kant","KG,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Germany","Asia,Europe"
"199 a distinguishing garb and livery. It was thus that the Peripatetics extended their empire so widely, and united their subjects in one common obedience. Kant had, over and above all this, the art of insisting, that his disciples should belong exclusively to himself. He explicitly announced, that he was not going to found a school of Eclectics, but a school of his own; a school not only independent, but in some measure hostile to every other; that he could admit of no compromise with any sect whatever; that he was come to overturn everything which existed in philosophy, and to erect a new edifice on these immense ruins. The more decided and arrogant the terms were in which he announced his design, the more likely was it to succeed; for the human mind submits more easily to an unlimited than to a partial faith, and yields itself up without reserve, rather than consent to cavil about restrictions and conditions even in favour of its own independence.” With these causes of Kant’s success another seems to have powerfully conspired; the indis- soluble coherence and concatenation of all the different parts of his philosophy. “ It is on this concatenation (says M. Prevost) that the admi¬ ration of Kant’s followers is chiefly founded.” Grant only (they boast) the first principles of the Critical Philosophy, and you must grant the whole system. The passage quoted on this occasion by M. Prevost is so forcibly expressed, that I cannot do it justice in an English version: “ Ab bine enim capitibus fluere necesse est om- nem philosophise criticse rationis pur® vim atque virtutem; namque in ea contextus rerum pror- sus mirabilis est, ita ut extrema primis, media utrisque, omnia omnibus respondeant; si pi'ima dederis danda sunt omnia.”1 No worse ac¬ count could well have been given of a philo¬ sophical Avork on such a subject; nor could any of its characteristical features have been pointed out more symptomatic of its ephemeral reputa¬ tion. Supposing the praise to be just, it repre¬ sented the system, however fair and imposing in its first aspect, as vitally and mortally vulne¬ rable (if at all vulnerable) in every point; and, accordingly, it was fast approaching to its dis¬ solution before the death of its author. In Ger¬ many, at present, we are told, that a pure Kan¬ tian is scarcely to be found.3 But there are many Semi-Kantians and Anti-Kantians, as well as partisans of other schemes built out of the ruins of the Kantian philosophy.3 “ In fine (says a late author), the Critique of Pure Reason, announced with pomp, received with fanaticism, disputed about with fury, after hav¬ ing accomplished the overthrow of the doctrines taught by Leibnitz and Wolff, could no longer support itself upon its own foundations, and has produced no permanent result, but divisions and enmities, and a general disgust at all systemati¬ cal creeds.”4 If this last effect has really re¬ sulted from it (of which some doubts may per¬ haps be entertained), it may be regarded as a favourable symptom of a sounder taste in mat¬ ters of abstract science, than has ever yet pre¬ vailed in that country.5 To these details, I have only to add a re- _1 See some very valuable strictures on Kant, in the learned and elegant sketch of the present state of philosophy, sub¬ joined to M.

"When this affectation of systematical method began, in consequence of the more enlarged views of philosophers, to give way to that aphoristical style so strongly recommended and so happily exemplified by Lord Bacon, we find some writers of the old school complaining of the innovation, in terms not unlike those in which the philosophy of the English has been censured by some German critics. “ The best wav (says Dr Watts) to learn any science, is to begin with a regular sys- 200 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",,"UK,DE",8,"N/A,Germany","N/A,Europe"
"201 as the source of all reality as well as of all science, and in thus transporting the mind into an in¬ tellectual region, inaccessible to men possessed only of the ordinary number of senses, both agree ; and to this vein of transcendental mysti¬ cism may probably be ascribed the extraordinary enthusiasm with which their doctrines appear to have been received by the German youth. Since the time when Degerando wrote, a new and very unexpected revolution is said to have taken place among Schelling’s disciples; many of them, originally educated in the Protestant faith, hav¬ ing thrown themselves into the bosom of the Catholic church1 2 “ The union of the faith¬ ful of this school forms an invisible church, which has adopted for its symbol and watch¬ word, the Virgin Mary; and hence rosaries are sometimes to be seen in the hands of those who reckon Spinoza among the greatest prophets.” It is added, however, with respect to this invi¬ sible church, that <c its members have embraced the Catholic religion, not as the true religion, but as the most poeticala thing not impro¬ bable among a people who have so strong a dis¬ position to mingle together poetry and meta¬ physics in the same compositions.3 But it is painful to contemplate these sad aberrations of human reason; nor would I have dwelt on them so long as I have done, had I not been anxious to convey to my readers a general, but I trust not unfaithful, idea of the style and spirit of a philosophy, which, within the short period of our recollection, rose, flourished, and fell; and which, in every stage of its history, furnished employment to the talents of some of the most learned and able of our contemporaries.3 The space which I have allotted to Kant has so far exceeded what I intended he should oc¬ cupy, that I must pass over the names of many of his countrymen much more worthy of public attention. In the account given by Degerando of the opponents of the Kantian system, some remarks are quoted from different writers, which convey a very favourable idea of the works from which they are borrowed. Among these I would more particularly distinguish those ascribed to Jacobi and to Reinhold. In the Memoirs, too, of the Berlin Academy, where, as Degerando justly observes, the philosophy of Locke found an asylum, while banished from the rest ot Germany, there is a considerable number of metaphysical articles of the highest merit.4 Nor must I omit to mention the contributions to this science by the university of Goettingen ; more especially on questions connected with the philosophy of language. I have great pleasure, also, in acknowledging the entertainment I have received, and the lights I have borrowed from the learned labours of Meiners and of Herder ; but none of these are so closely connected with the history of metaphysics as to justify me in entering into particular details with respect to them. I am ashamed to say that, in Great Bri¬ tain, the only one of these names which has been much talked of is that of Kant; a circum¬ stance which, I trust, will apologise for the length to which the foregoing observations have extended.5 1 See a paper by M.

"3 According to a French writer, who appears to have resided many years in Germany, and who has enlivened a short Essay on the Elements of Philosophy with many curious historical details concerning Kant and his successors, both 1. ichte and Schelling owed much of their reputation to the uncommon eloquence displayed in their academical lectures:—“ Cette doctrine sortait de la bouche de Fichte, revetu de ces ornemens qui donnent la jeunesse, la beaute, et la force au discours",Kant,"DE,KG,FR",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan,France","Europe,Asia,Europe"

"The only other country of Europe from which any contributions to metaphysical philosophy could be reasonably looked for, during the eigh¬ teenth century, is Italy; and to this particular branch of science I do not know that any Italian of much celebrity has, in these later times, turn¬ ed his attention. The metaphysical works of Cardinal Gerdil (a native of Savoy) are extolled by some French writers; but none of them have ever happened to fall in my way.1 At a more recent period, Genovesi, a Neapolitan philoso¬ pher* (best known as apolitical economist), has attracted a good deal of notice by some meta¬ physical publications. Their chief object is said to be to reconcile, as far as possible, the opinions of Leibnitz with those of Locke. “ Pendant que Condillac donnait inutilement des le9ons a un Prince d’ltalie, Genovesi en donnait avec plus de succes a ses eleves Napolitains: il com- binait le mieux qu’il lui etoit possible les theories de Leibnitz, pour lequel il eut toujours une pre¬ vention favorable, avec celle de Locke, qu’il accredita le premier en Italic.”3 Various other works of greater or less celebrity, from Italian authors, seem to announce a growing taste in that part ot Europe for these abstract researches.

"The affinities and filiations of different tongues, as evinced in their corresponding roots and other coincidences, are abundantly curious, hut incomparably more easy in the explanation, than the systematical analogy which is said to exist between the Sanscrit and the Greek (and also between the Sanscrit and the Latin, which is considered as the most ancient dialect of the Greek), in the conjugations and flexions of their verbs, and in many other particulars of their mechanism ; an analogy which is represented as so complete, that, in the versions which have been made from the one language into the other, “ Sanscrit,” we are told, “ answers to Greek, as face to face in a glass.”1 That the Sanscrit did not grow up to the perfection which it now exhibits, from popular and casual modes of speech, the unexampled regularity of its forms seems almost to demonstrate; and yet, should tliis supposition he rejected, to what other hypo¬ thesis shall we have recourse, which does not involve equal, if not greater improbabilities ? The problem is well worthy of the attention of philosophical grammarians; and the solution of it, whatever it may be, can scarcely fail to throw some new lights on the history of the human race, as well as on that of the human mind",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"The Metaphysical Philosophy of Scotland, and, indeed, the literary taste in general, which so remarkably distinguished this country during the last century, may he dated from the lectures of Dr Francis Hutcheson, in the University of Glasgow. Strong indications of the same spe¬ culative spirit may be traced in earlier writers;2 hut it was from this period that Scotland, after a long slumber, began again to attract general notice in the republic of letters.3 The writings of Dr Hutcheson, however, are more closely connected with the history of Ethical than of Metaphysical Science; and I 1 Letter from the Reverend David Brown, Provost of the College of Fort William, about the Smscrit Edition of the Gospels (dated Calcutta, September 1806, and published in some of the Literary Journals of the day.) 4 See Note B B B","University, Glasgow","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"One of his distinguishing doctrines is, that the Deity is the immediate agent in producing the phenomena of the Material World ; but that, in the Moral World, the case is different,—a doctrine which, whatever may be thought of it in other respects, is undoubtedly a great im¬ provement on that of Malebranche, which, by representing God as the only agent in the uni¬ verse, was not less inconsistent than the scheme of Spinoza with the moral nature of Man. “ The Deity (says Baxter) is not only at the bead of Nature, but in every part of it. A chain of material causes betwixt the Deity and the effect produced, and much more a series of them, is such a supposition as would conceal the Deity from the knowledge of mortals for ever. We might search for matter above matter, till we were lost in a labyrinth out of which no phi¬ losopher ever yet found his way.—This way of bringing in second causes is borrowed from the government of the moral world, where free agents act a part; but it is very improperly ap- che sia uscito di Scozia Francesco Hutcheson venuto in Iscozia, a professarvi la Filosofia, e gli studii di umanith, nella Universita di Glasgow, v’insinuo per tutto il paese colie istruzione a viva voce, e con egregie opere date alle stampe, un vivo genio per gli studii filosofici, e literarii, e sparse qui fecondissimi semi, d’onde vediamo nascere si felice frutti, e si copiose.”—(Discorso sopra le Vicende della Litteratura, del Sig. Carlo Denina, p. 224, Glasgow edit. 1763.) I was somewhat surprised to meet with the foregoing observations in the work of a foreigner ; but, wherever he acquired his information, it evinces, in those from whom it was derived, a more intimate acquaintance with the traditionary history of letters in this country than has fallen to the share of most of our own authors who have treated of that subject. I have heard it conjectured, that the materials of his section on Scottish literature had been communicated to him by Mr Hume","Man, Sig, Glasgow","CI,DZ,GB",8,"Côte d'Ivoire,Algeria,United Kingdom","Africa,Africa,Europe"
"Another foreign writer, much better qualified than Denina to appreciate the merits of Hutcheson, has expressed him¬ self upon this subject with his usual precision. “ L’ecole Ecossaise a en quelque sorte pour fondateur Hutcheson, mailre et predecesseur de Smith. C’est ce philosophe qui lui a imprimb son caractere, et qui a commence a lui donner de Teclat.” In a note upon this passage, the author observes,—“ C’est en ce seal sens qu’on peut donner un chef a une bcole de philosophic qui, comme on le verra, professe d’ailleurs la plus parfaite inddpendance de I’autoritb—(See the excellent reflections upon the posthumous works of Adam Smith, annexed by M.

"3 A gentleman, who lived in habits of great intimacy with Dr Held towards the close of his life, and on whose accuracy I can fully depend, remembers to have heard him say repeatedly, that “ Mr Hume, in his Essays, appeared to hwe forgot¬ ten his Metaphysics.” Nor will this supposition be thought improbable, if, in addition to the subtle and fugitive nature of the subjects canvassed in the Treatise of Human Nature, it be considered that long before the publication of his Essays, Mr Hume had abandoned all his metaphysical researches. In proof of this, I shall quote a passage from a letter of his to Sir Gilbert Elliot, which, though without a date, seems from its contents to have been written about 1750 or 1751. The pas¬ sage is interesting on another account, as it serves to show how much Mr Hume undervalued the utility of mathematical learning, and consequently how little he was aware of its importance, as an organ of physical discovery, and as the founda¬ tion of some of the most necessary arts of civilised life. “ I am sorry that our correspondence should lead us into these ab¬ stract speculations. I have thought, and read, and composed very little on such questions of late. Morals, politics, and literature, have employed all my time ; but still the other topics I must think more curious, important, entertaining, and useful, than any geometry that is deeper than Euclid.” I have said that it is in Mr Hume’s earliest work that his metaphysical talents appear, in my opinion, to the greatest advantage. From the following advertisement, however, prefixed, in the latest editions of his works, to the second volume of his Essays and Treatises, Mr Hume himself would appear to have thought differently. “Most of the principles and rea¬ sonings contained in this volume were published in a work in three volumes, called A Treatise of Human Nature ; a work which the author had projected before he left College, and which he wrote and published not long after. But not finding it successful, he was sensible of his error in going to the press too early, and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces, where some negligencies in his former reasoning, and some in the expression, are, he hopes, corrected. Yet several wri¬ ters, who have honoured the author’s philosophy with answers, have taken care to direct all their batteries against that ju¬ venile work, which the author never acknowledged, and have affected to triumph in any advantage which they imagined they had obtained over it; a practice very contrary to all rules of candour and fair dealing, and a strong instance of those polemical artifices which a bigoted zeal thinks itself authorised to employ. Henceforth, the author desires, that the follow¬ ing pieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical sentiments and principles.” After this declaration, it certainly would be highly uncandid to impute to Mr Hume any philosophical sentiments or principles not to be found in his Philosophical Essays, as well as in his Treatise. But where is the unfairness of replying to any plausible arguments in the latter work, even although Mr Hume may have omitted them in his subsequent publications ; more especially where these arguments supply any useful lights for illustrating his more popular compositions ? The Treatise of Human Nature will certainly be remembered as long as any of Mr Hume’s philosophical writings ; nor is any person qualified either to approve or to reject his doctrines, who has not studied them in the systematical form in which they were originally cast. That Mr Hume’s remonstrance may be just with respect to some of his adversaries, I believe to be true ; but it is surely expressed in a tone more querulous and peevish than is justified by the occasion","Euclid, Most","US,CZ",8,"United States,Czechia","North America,Europe"
"It is neither a scheme of Materialism, nor a scheme of Spiritualism; for his reasonings strike equally at the root of both these theories. His aim is to establish a universal scepticism, and to produce in the reader a complete distrust in his own faculties. For this purpose he avails himself of the data assumed by the most op¬ posite sects, shifting his ground skilfully from one position to another, as best suits the scope of his present argument. With the single ex¬ ception of Bayle, he has carried this sceptical mode of reasoning farther than any other mo¬ dern philosopher. Cicero, who himself belong¬ ed nominally to the same school, seems to have thought, that the controversial habits imposed on the Academical sect by their profession of universal doubt, required a greater versatility of talent and fertility of invention, than were ne¬ cessary for defending any particular system of tenets;1 and it is not improbable, that Mr Hume, in the pride of youthful genius, was misled by this specious but very fallacious idea. On the other hand, Bayle has the candour to acknow¬ ledge, that nothing is so easy as to dispute after the manner of the sceptics;2 3 * and to this propo¬ sition every man of reflection will find himself more and more disposed to assent, as he ad¬ vances in life. It is experience alone that can convince us, how much more difficult it is to make any real progress in the search after truth, than to acquire a talent for plausible dis¬ putation.5 That this spirit of sceptical argument has been 1 “ Nam si singulas disciplinas percipere magnum est, quanto majus omnes ? quod facere iis necesse est, quibus proposi- tum est, veri reperiendi causa, et contra omnes philosophos et pro omnibus dicere—Cujus rei tantse tamque dimcilis xacul- tatem consecutum esse me non profiteer: Secutum esse prae me fero.”—(Cicero Be Nat. Dear. 1. i. v.) 2 See the passage quoted from Bayle, in page 86 of this Dissertation. _ 3 In the very interesting account, given by Dr Holland, of Velara, a modern Greek physician, whom he met with at-La- rissa in Thessaly, a few slight particulars are mentioned, which let us completely into the character of that ingenious per¬ son. “ It appeared,” says Dr Holland, “ that Velara had thought much on the various topics of Metaphysics and Morals, and his conversation on these topics bore the same tone of satirical scepticism which was apparent as the general feature o his opinions. We spoke of the questions of Materialism and Necessity, on both of which he declared an affirmative opi¬ nion.”—(Holland’s Travels in the Ionian Isles, See. p. 275.) “ I passed this evening with Velara at his own house, and sat with him till a late hour. During part of the time our conversation turned upon metaphysical topics, and chiefly on the old Pyrrhonic doctrine of the non-existence of Matter. Velara, as usual, took the sceptical side of the argument, in w ^ic he showed much ingenuity and great knowledge of the more eminent controversialists on this and other collateral subjec s. - CIbid. p. 370.) We see here a lively picture of a character daily to be met with in more polished and learned societies, dis¬ puting not for truth but for victory; in the first conversation professing himself a Materialist; and in the secon enyin0 the existence of Matter ; on both occasions, taking up that ground where he was most likely to provoke opposi ion","Cicero, Holland","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"From the weakness, too, of the entrenchments which he has here thrown up for his own secu¬ rity, he seems to have been sensible, that it was not capable of a long or vigorous resistance. In the mean time, he betrays no want of confidence in his original position; but repeating his as¬ sertion, that “ we derive the opinion of the ne¬ cessity of a cause to every new production, neither from demonstration nor from intuition,” he boldly concludes, that “ this opinion must necessarily arise from observation and experi¬ ence.”—(Vol. I. p. 147.) Or, as he elsewhere expresses himself, “ All our reasonings concern¬ ing causes and effects are derived from nothing but custom; and, consequently, belief is more Treatise of Human Nature, Vol. I. p. 144—Although Mr Hume, however, succeeded better than any of his predeces- sors, m calling the attention of philosophers to this discussion, his opinion on the subject does not possess the merit, in point of originality, which was supposed to belong to it either by himself or by his antagonists. See the passages which I lave quoted in proof of this, in the first volume of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, p. 542. et seq. fourth edit, and also in the second volume of the same work, p. 556. et seq. second edit. Among these, I request the attention of my readers more particularly to a passage from a book entitled, The Procedure, Extent, and Limits of the Human Understanding, published two years before the Treatise of Human Nature, and commonly ascribed to Dr Browne, Bishop of Cork. The coincidence is ruly wonderful, as it can scarcely, by any possibility, be supposed that this book was ever heard of by Mr Hume",Cork,IE,8,Ireland,Europe
"In a private letter of Mr Hume’s, to one of his most intimate friends,1 some light is thrown on the circumstances which first led his mind into this train of sceptical speculation. As his narrative has every appearance of the most per¬ fect truth and candour, and contains several passages which I doubt not will be very gene¬ rally interesting to my readers, I shall give it a place, together with some extracts from the cor¬ respondence to which it gave rise, in the Notes at the end of this Dissertation. Every thing connected with the origin and composition of a work which has had so powerful an influence on the direction which metaphysical pursuits have since taken, both in Scotland2 and in Germany, will be allowed to form an important article of philosophical history; and this history I need not offer any apology for choosing to communi¬ cate to the public rather in Mr Hume’s words than in my own.5 From the reply to this letter by Mr Hume’s very ingenious and accomplished correspondent, we learn that he had drawn from Mr Hume’s metaphysical discussions the only sound and philosophical inference : that the lameness of the proofs offered by Descartes and his succes¬ sors, of some fundamental truths universally 1 Sir Gilbert Elliot, Bart, grandfather of the present Earl of Minto.

"2 A foreign writer, of great name (M. Frederick Schlegel), seems to think that the influence of Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature on the Philosophy of England has been still more extensive than I had conceived it to be. His opinion on this point I transcribe as a sort of literary curiosity : “ Since the time of Hume, nothing more has been attempted in England, than to erect all sorts of bulwarks against the practical influence of his destructive scepticism; and to maintain, by various substitutes and aids, the pile of moral prin¬ ciple uncorrupted and entire. Not only with Adam Smith, but with all their late philosophers, national welfare is the ruling and central principle of thought;—a principle excellent and praiseworthy in its due situation, but quite unfitted for being the centre and orach of all knowledge and science."" From the connection in which this last sentence stands with the context, would not one imagine that the writer conceived the Wealth of Nations to be a new moral or metaphysical system, devised by Mr Smith, for the purpose of counteracting Mr Hume’s scepticism ? I have read this translation of Mr Schlegel’s lectures with much curiosity and interest, and flatter myself that we shall soon have English versions of the works of Kant, and of other German authors, from the pens of their English disciples",Kant,"KG,UK,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,N/A,Germany","Asia,N/A,Europe"
"Little more, I am fully persuaded, is necessary, in this country, to bring down the philosophy of Germany to its proper In treating of literary and historical subjects, Mr Schlegel seems to be more in his element, than when he ventures to pronounce on philosophical questions. But even in cases of the former description, some of his dashing judgments on Eng¬ lish writers can be accounted for only by haste, caprice, or prejudice. “ The English themselves (we are told) are now pretty well convinced, that Robertson is a careless, superficial, and blundering historian: although they study his works, and are right in doing so, as models of pure composition, extremely deserving of attention during the present declining state of English style •••••• • • With all the abundance of his Italian elegance, what is the overloaded and affected Roscoe when compared with Gibbon . Coxe, although master of a good and classical style, resembles Robertson in no respect so much as in the superncialness of his researches; and the statesman Fox has nothing in common with Hume but the bigotry of his party zeal.” Such criticisms may perhaps be applauded by a German auditory, but in this country they can injure the reputation of none but their author.

"“ Your notion of correcting subtlety by sen¬ timent is certainly very just with regard to mo¬ rals, which depend upon sentiment: And in politics and natural philosophy, whatever con¬ clusion is contrary to certain matters of fact, must certainly be wrong, and there must some error lie somewhere in the argument, whether we be able to show it or not. But, in metaphy¬ sics or theology, I cannot see how either of these plain and obvious standards of truth can have place. Nothing there can correct bad reason¬ ing but good reasoning; and sophistry must be opposed by syllogism.3 About seventy or eighty years ago,4 * * I observe a principle like that which you advance prevailed very much in France, amongst some philosophers and beaux esprits",,FR,8,France,Europe
"2 Voltaire, in his catalogue of the illustrious writers who adorned the reign of Louis XIV. is one of the very few French authors who have spoken of Buffier with due respect: “ II y a dans ses traite's de mdtaphysique des morceaux que Locke n’aurait pas desavoues, et c’est le seul jesuite qui ait mis une philosophie raisonnahle dans ses ouvrages.” Another French philosopher, too, of a very different school, and certainly not disposed to overrate the talents of Buffier, has, in a work published as lately as 1805, candidly acknowledged the lights which he might have derived from the labours of his prede¬ cessor, if he had been acquainted with them at an earlier period of his studies. Condillac, he also observes, might have profited greatly by the same lights, if he had availed himself of their guidance, in his inquiries concerning the human un¬ derstanding. “ Du moins est il certain que pour ma part, je suis fort fachd de ne connoitre que depuis tres peu de temps ces opinions du Pere Buffier; si je les avais vues plutot enoncees quelque part, elles m’auraient dpargne beaucoup de peines et d’hdsitations.”—“ Je regrette beaucoup que Condillac, dans ses profondes et sagaces meditations sur I’intelligence hu- maine, n’ait pas fait plus d’attention aux idees du Pere Buffier,” &c. &c—Eltmens d'Ideologic, par M. Destutt-Tracy, Tom. III. pp. 136, 137. (See Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, Vol. II. pp. 88, 89, 2d edit.) 3 May not sophistry be also opposed, by appealing to the fundamental laws of human belief; and, in some cases, by appeal- mg to facts for which we have the evidence of our own consciousness ? The word sentiment does not express, with sufficient precision, the test which Mr Hume’s correspondent had manifestly in view",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Claude and the Protestants answered him, not by solving his difficulties (which seems impos¬ sible), but by retorting them (which is very easy.) They showed, that to reach the way of authority which the Catholics insist on, as long a train of acute reasoning, and as great erudi¬ tion was requisite, as would be sufficient for a Protestant. We must first piwe all the truths of natural religion, the foundation of morals, the divine authority of the Scripture, the de¬ ference which it commands to the church, the tradition of the church, &c. &c. The compari¬ son of these controversial writings begat an idea in some, that it was neither by reasoning nor authority we learn our religion, but by senti¬ ment ; and this was certainly a vei*y convenient way, and what a philosopher would be very well pleased to comply with, if he could dis¬ tinguish sentiment from education. But, to all appearance, the sentiment of Stockholm, Geneva, Rome, ancient and modern Athens, and Memphis, have not the same characters; and no thinking man can implicitly assent to any of them, but from the general principle, that, as the truth on these subjects is beyond human capacity, and that, as for one’s own ease, he must adopt some tenets, there is more satisfac¬ tion and com enience in holding to the cate¬ chism we have been first taught. Now, this I have nothing to say against. I would only observe, that such a conduct is founded on the most universal and determined scepticism. For more curiosity and research give a direct oppo¬ site turn from the same principles.” On this careless effusion of Mr Hume’s pen, it would be unpardonable to offer any critical strictures. It cannot, however, be considered as improper to hint, that there is a wide and essential difference between those articles of faith which formed the subjects of dispute be¬ tween Nicole and Claude, and those laws of be- lief, of which it is the great object of the Trea¬ tise of Human Nature to undermine the autho¬ rity. The reply of Mr Hume, therefore, is evasive, and although strongly marked with the writer’s ingenuity, does not bear upon the point in question","Stockholm, Geneva, Rome, Athens, Memphis","US,SE",8,"United States,Sweden","North America,Europe"
"217 you with any formal compliments or thanks, which would be but an ill return for the kind¬ ness you have done me in writing in my behalf, to one you are so little acquainted with as Dr Butler; and, I am afraid, stretching the truth in favour of a friend. I have called on the doc¬ tor, with a design of delivering your letter, but find he is at present in the country. I am a little anxious to have the doctor’s opinion. My own I dare not trust to; both because it concerns myself, and because it is so variable, that I know not how to fix it. Sometimes it elevates me above the clouds ; at other times it depresses me with doubts and fears; so that, whatever be my success, I cannot be entirely disappointed.” Whether Mr Hume ever enjoyed the satisfac¬ tion of a personal interview with Dr Butler, I have not heard. From a letter of his to Mr Home, dated London, 1739, we learn that if any intercourse took place between them, it must have been after the publication of the Treatise of Human Nature. “ I have sent the Bishop of Bristol a copy; but could not wait upon him with your letter after he had arrived at that dignity. At least, I thought it would be to no purpose after I began the printing.”1 In a subsequent letter to the same correspondent, written in 1742, he expresses his satisfaction at the favourable opinion which he understood Dr Butler had formed of his volume of Essays, then recently published, and augurs well from this circumstance of the success of his book. “ I am told that Dr Butler has everywhere recommend¬ ed them, so that I hope they will have some success.”2 3 * These particulars, trifling as they may ap¬ pear to some, seemed to me, for more reasons than one, not unworthy of notice in this sketch","London, Bristol","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"“ I must, therefore, beg of you, most earnest¬ ly, to make no contrast in my favour to the dis¬ paragement of my predecessors in the same pur¬ suits. I can truly say of them, and shall al¬ ways avow, what you are pleased to say of me, that, hut for the assistance I have received from their writings, I never could have wrote or thought what I have done.”1 2 When I reflect on the stress thus laid by Hr Reid on this part of his writings, and his fre¬ quent recurrence to the same argument when¬ ever his subject affords him an opportunity of forcing it upon the attention of his readers, I cannot help expressing my wonder, that Kant and other German philosophers, who appear to have so carefully studied those passages in Reid, which relate to Hume’s Theory of Causation, should have overlooked entirely what he him¬ self considered as the most original and im¬ portant of all his discussions; more especially as the conclusion to which it leads has been long admitted, by the best judges in this island, as one of the few propositions in metaphysical science completely established beyond the reach of controversy. Even those who affect to speak the most lightly of Hr Reid’s contributions to the philosophy of the human mind, have found nothing to object to his reasonings against the ideal theory, but that the absurdities involved in it are too glaring to require a serious ex¬ amination.® Had these reasonings been consi¬ dered in the same light in Germany, it is quite impossible that the analogical language of Leib¬ nitz, in which he speaks of the soul as a living mirror of the universe^ could have been again re¬ vived ; a mode of speaking liable to every ob¬ jection which Reid has urged against the ideal theory. Such, however, it would appear, is the fact. The word Representation (VorstellungJ is 1 An ingenious and profound writer, who, though intimately connected with Mr Hume in habits of friendship, was not blind to the vulnerable parts of his Metaphysical System, has bestowed, in the latest of his publications, the following en¬ comium on Dr Reid’s Philosophical Works",Kant,"DE,KG",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan","Europe,Asia"
"220 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS, now the German substitute for Idea ; nay, one of the most able works which Germany has pro¬ duced since the commencement of its new phi¬ losophical era, is entitled Nova Theoria Facul- tatis Representativce Humana;. In the same work, the author has prefixed, as a motto to the second book, in which he treats of <c the Representative Faculty in general,” the following sentence from Locke, which he seems to have thought himself entitled to assume as a first principle : “ Since the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other immediate object but its own ideas (representationsJ, which it alone does or can contemplate, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them.”—(Locke’s Essay, B. IV. ch. 1.) In a country where this meta¬ physical jargon still passes current among wri¬ ters of eminence, it is vain to expect that any solid progress can be made in the inductive phi¬ losophy of the human mind. A similar remark may be extended to another country, where the title of Ideologie (a word which takes for granted the truth of the hypothesis which it was Reid’s great aim to explode) has been lately given to the very science in which the theory of Ideas has been so clearly shown to have been, in all ages, the most fruitful source of error and absurdity.1 Of the other works by Scottish metaphysi¬ cians, which appeared soon after the Inquiry into the Human Mind, I have not left myself room to speak. I know of none of them from which something important may not be learned; while several of them (particularly those of Dr Camp¬ bell) have struck out many new and interesting views. To one encomium all of them are well entitled, that of aiming steadily at the advance¬ ment of useful knowledge and of human happi¬ ness. But the principles on which they have proceeded have so close an affinity to those of Dr Reid, that I could not, without repeating what I have already said, enter into any ex¬ planation concerning their characteristical doc¬ trines",Of,"DE,TR",8,"Germany,Turkey","Europe,Asia"
"On comparing the opposition which Mr Hume’s scepticism encountered from his own countrymen, with the account formerly given of the attempts of some German philosophers to refute his Theory of Causation, it is impossible not to be struck with the coincidence between the leading views of his most eminent antago¬ nists. This coincidence one would have been disposed to consider as purely accidental, if Kant, by his petulant sneers at Reid, Beattie, and Oswald, had not expressly acknowledged, that he was not unacquainted with their writ¬ ings. As for the great discovery, which he seems to claim as his own,—that the ideas of Cause and Effect, as well as many others, are derived from the pure understanding without any aid from experience, it is nothing more than a repetition, in very nearly the same terms, of what was advanced a century before by Cud- worth, in reply to Hobbes and Gassendi; and borrowed avowedly by Cudworth from the rea¬ sonings of Socrates, as reported by Plato, in answer to the scepticism of Protagoras. This recurrence, under different forms, of the same metaphysical controversies, which so often sur¬ prises and mortifies us in the history of litera¬ ture^ is an evil which will probably always con¬ tinue, more or less, even in the most prosperous state of philosophy. But it affords no objection to the utility of metaphysical pursuits. While the sceptics keep the field, it must not be aban¬ doned by the friends of sounder principles; nor ought they to be discouraged from their un¬ grateful task, by the reflection, that they have probably been anticipated, in everything they have to say, by more than one of their predeces¬ sors. If any thing is likely to check this perio¬ dical return of a mischief so unpropitious to the progress of useful knowledge, it seems to be the general diffusion of that historical informa¬ tion concerning the literature and science of former times, of which it is the aim of these Preliminary Dissertations to present an outline","Kant, Plato","KG,CO,DE",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Colombia,Germany","Asia,South America,Europe"
"And here I cannot refrain from remarking the injustice with which the advocates for truth are apt to be treated; and by none more re¬ markably than by that class of writers who pro¬ fess the greatest zeal for its triumph. The im¬ portance of their labours is discredited by those who are the loudest in their declamations and invectives against the licentious philosophy of the present age; insomuch that a careless ob¬ server would be inclined to imagine (if I may borrow Mr Hume’s words on another occasion), that the battle was fought “ not by the men at arms, who manage the pike and the sword; but by the trumpeters, drummers, and musicians, of the army.” These observations may serve, at the same time, to account for the slow and (according to some persons) imperceptible advances of the philosophy of the human mind, since the publi¬ cation of Locke’s Essay. With those who still attach themselves to that author, as an infallible guide in metaphysics, it is in vain to argue; but I would willingly appeal to any of Locke’s rational and discriminating admirers, whether much has not been done by his successors, and, among others, by members of our northern uni¬ versities, towards the illustration and correction of such of his principles as have furnished, both to English and French sceptics, the foundation of their theories.1 If this be granted, the way has, at least, been cleared and prepared for the labours of our posterity; and neither the cavils of the sceptic, nor the refutation of them by the sounder logician, can be pronounced to be use¬ less to mankind. Nothing can be juster or more liberal than the following reflection of Reid : “ I conceive the sceptical writers to be a set of men, whose business it is to pick holes in the fabric of knowledge wherever it is weak and faulty ; and when those places are properly re¬ paired, the whole building becomes more firm and solid than it was formerly.”—(Inquiry into the Human Mind. Dedication.) There is, indeed, one point of view, in which it must be owned that Mr Hume’s Treatise has had an unfavourable effect (and more especially in Scotland) on the progress of Metaphysical Science. Had it not been for the zeal of some of his countrymen to oppose the sceptical con¬ clusions, which they conceived it to be his aim to establish, much of that ingenuity which has been wasted in the refutation of his sophistry (or, to speak more correctly, in combating the mistaken principles on which he proceeded) would, in all probability, have been directed to speculations more immediately applicable to the business of life, or more agreeable to the taste of the present age. What might not have been expected from Mr Hume himself, had his power¬ ful and accomplished mind been more frequent¬ ly turned to the study of some parts of our na¬ ture (of those, for example, which are connected with the principles of criticism), in examining which, the sceptical bias of his disposition would have had fewer opportunities of leading him astray ! In some fragments of this sort, which enliven and adorn his collection of Essays, one is at a loss whether more to admire the subtlety of his genius, or the solidity and good sense of his critical judgments",,"UK,FR",8,"N/A,France","N/A,Europe"
"Nor have these elegant applications of meta¬ physical pursuits been altogether overlooked by Mr Hume’s antagonists. The active and ad¬ venturous spirit of Lord Kames, here, as in many other instances, led the way to his coun¬ trymen ; and, due allowances being made for the novelty and magnitude of his undertaking, with a success far greater than could have been reasonably anticipated. The Elements of Criti¬ cism, considered as the first systematical attempt to investigate the metaphysical principles of the 1 According to Dr Priestley, the labours of these commentators on Locke have done more harm than good. “ I think Mr Locke has been hasty in concluding that there is some other source of our ideas besides the external senses ; but the rest of his system appears to me and others to be the corner stone of all just and rational knowledge of ourselves.” “ This solid foundation, however, has lately been attempted to be overturned by a set of pretended philosophers,^ of whom the most conspicuous and assuming is Dr Iteid, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow.’ — (Exam, of Reid, Beattie, and Oswald, p. 5.)—As to Mr Hume, Dr Priestley says, “ In my opinion, he has been very ably answered, again and again, upon more solid principles than those of this new common sense ; and I beg leave to refer to the two first volumes of my Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion.""—(Examination of Reid, 8[C.

"The compilation of a Manual of Rational Logic, adapted to the present state of science and of society in Europe, is a desideratum which, it is to be hoped, will at no distant period be sup¬ plied. It is a work, certainly, of which the exe¬ cution has been greatly facilitated by the philo¬ sophical labours of the last century. The varie¬ ties of intellectual character among men present another very interesting object of study, which, considering its practical utility, has not yet ex¬ cited, so much as might have been expected, the curiosity of our countrymen. Much, too, is still wanting to complete the theory of evidence",Much,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"Campbell has touched upon it with his usual acuteness, hut he has attempted nothing more than an illustration of a very few general prin¬ ciples. Nor has he turned his attention to the various illusions of the imagination, and of the passions, by which the judgment is liable to he warped in the estimates it forms of moral evi¬ dence in the common affairs of life. This is a most important inquiry, considering how often the lives and fortunes of men are subjected to the decisions of illiterate persons concerning cir¬ cumstantial proofs; and how much the success or failure of every individual in the conduct of his private concerns turns on the sagacity or rashness with which he anticipates future con¬ tingencies. Since the time when Campbell wrote, an attempt has been made by Condorcet2 and some other French writers, to apply a mathema¬ tical calculus to moral and political truths; but though much metaphysical ingenuity, as well as mathematical skill, have been displayed in carry¬ ing it into execution, it has not yet led to any useful practical results. Perhaps it may even be questioned, whether, in investigating truths of this sort, the intellectual powers can derive much aid from the employment of such an organ","Campbell, Campbell","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"From this account of the nature and object of metaphysical science, it may he reasonably ex¬ pected, that those with whom it is a favourite and habitual pursuit, should acquire a more than ordinary capacity of retiring, at pleasure, from the external to the internal world. They may be expected also to acquire a disposition to ex¬ amine the origin of whatsoever combinations they may find established in the fancy, and a superiority to the casual associations which warp common understandings. Hence an accuracy and a subtlety in their distinctions on all sub¬ jects, and those peculiarities in their views which are characteristical of unbiassed and original thinking. But, perhaps, the most valuable fruit of their researches, is that scrupulous precision in the use of language, upon which, more than upon any one circumstance whatever, the logi¬ cal accuracy of our reasonings, and the justness of our conclusions, essentially depend. Accord¬ ingly it will he found, on a review of the history of the moral sciences, that the most important steps which have been made in some of those, apparently the most remote from metaphysical pursuits (in the science, for example, of politi¬ cal economy), have been made by men trained to the exercise of their intellectual powers by 1 The following is the account of Metaphysics given by Hobbes :—u There is a certain Philosophia prima, on which all other Philosophy ought to depend; and consisteth principally in right limiting of the significations of such appellations, or names, as are of all others the most universal: which limitations serve to avoid ambiguity and equivocation in reasoning, and are commonly called Definitions; such as are the Definitions of Body, Time, Place, Matter, Form, Essence, Sub¬ ject, Substance, Ac*, dent, Power, Act, Finite, Infinite, Quantity, Quality, Motion, Action, Passion, and divers others, ne¬ cessary to the explaining of a man’s conceptions concerning the nature and generation of bodies.

"If by these means our native tongue has been rendered more unfit for some of the lighter species of writing, it has certainly gained immensely as an instrument of thought, and as a vehicle of 1 Under this head of education may also be mentioned the practical improvements which, during the course of the last century, have taken place in what Lord Bacon calls the traditive part of logic. I allude here not only to the new arrange¬ ments in the Lancasterian Schools, by which the diffusion of the art of reading among the poorer classes of the community is so wonderfully facilitated and extended, but to those admirable elementary works which have opened a ready and speedy access to the more recondite truths of the severer sciences. How much these have contributed to promote the progress of mathematical knowledge in France may be judged of from an assertion of Condorcet, that two years spent under an able teacher now carry the student beyond the conclusions which limited the researches of Leibnitz and of Newton. The Es¬ says lately published on this subject by M. Lacroix (Essais sur VEnseignement en General, et sur celui des Mathematiques en particulier. Paris, 1805) contain many valuable suggestions ; and, beside their utility to those who are concerned in the task of instruction, may justly be considered as an accession to the Philosophy of the Human Mind","Newton, Paris","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"As an instrument of thought and a medium of scientific communication, the English language appears to me, in its pre¬ sent state, to be far superior to the French. Diderot, indeed (a very high authority), has, with much confidence, asserted the contrary; and it is but fair to let him speak for himself: “ J’ajouterois volontiers que la marche didactique et reglee a laquelle notre langue est assujettie la rend plus propre aux sciences; et que par les tours et les inversions que le Grec, le Latin, ITtalien, 1’Anglois, se permettent, ces langues sont plus avantageuses pour les lettres: Que nous pouvons mieux qu’ aucun autre peuple faire parler I’esprit; et que le bon sens choisiroit la langue Francoise; mais que ITmagination et les passions donneroient la preference aux langues anciennes et a celles de nos voisins: Qu’il faut parler Francois dans la societd et dans les dcoles de Philosophic; et Grec, Latin, Anglois, dans les chaires et sur le Theatre: Que notre langue seroit celle de la verite, si jamais elle revient sur la terre; et que la Grecque, la Latine, et les autres seroient les langues de la fable et du mensonge. Le Francois est fait pour instruire, edairer, et convaincre; le Grec, le Latin, ITtalien, 1’Ang¬ lois, pour persuader, emouvoir, et tromper; parlez Grec, Latin, Italien au peuple, mais parlez Francois au sage.”— (CEuvres de Diderot, Tome II. pp. 70, 71- Amsterdam, 1772.) These peculiar excellencies of the French language are ascribed, in part, by Diderot, to the study of the Aristotelian Phi¬ losophy (Ibid. p. 7.) I do not well see what advantage France should, in this respect, have enjoyed over England ; and since that philosophy fell into disrepute, it will scarcely be alleged that the habits of thinking cultivated by Locke’s dis¬ ciples have been less favourable to a logical rigour of expression than those of any contemporary sect of French metaphy¬ sicians",Amsterdam,"FR,US,UK",8,"France,United States,N/A","Europe,North America,N/A"
"A later French writer has, with far greater justice, acknowledged the important services rendered to the French lan¬ guage, by the gentlemen of the Port Royal Society. “ L’Ecole de Port Royal, feconde en penseurs, illustre'e par les ^cri- vains les plus purs, par les drudits les plus laborieux du siecle de Louis XIY. eut deja rendu parmi nous un assez grand service k la philosophie par cela seul qu’elle a puissament concouru a fixer notre langue, h lui donner ce caractere de precision, de clartd, d’exactitude, qui la rend si favorable aux operations de I’esprit.”—Hist. Comparee, &c. Tome II",,FR,8,France,Europe
"P- 45-) Mr Gibbon also has remarked, how much “ the learned Society of Port Royal contributed to establish in France a taste for just reasoning, simplicity of style, and philosophical method.” The improvement, in all these respects, of our English writers, during the same period, is, in my opinion, much more remarkable",,"FR,UK",8,"France,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"On the other hand, may it not be asked, if the number of philosophical systems be greater than that of the sects which at present divide the Christian church ? The allusion here made to Bossuet’s celebrated History of the Variations, shows plainly, that the similarity of the two cases had not been overlooked by the ingenious writer; and that the only effectual remedy which, in his opinion, can be applied to either, is to subject once more the reason, both of philosophers and of di- rines, to the paramount authority of an infallible guide. The conclusion is such as might have been expected from a good Catholic; but I trust that, in this country, it is not likely to mislead many of my readers. Some recent conversions to Popery, however, which, in consequence of views similar to those of M. de Bonald, have taken place among the philoso¬ phers of Germany, afford a proof that, in the present political state of Europe, the danger of a temporary relapse into the suqerstitions of the Church of Borne, how slight soever, ought not to be regarded as altogether visionary.

"One of the earliest apologists for Machiavel was Albericus Gentilis, an Italian author ot whom some account will be given afterwards",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"The following passage from the excellent work of M. Simonde de Sismondi on the Literature of the South, appears to me to approach very near to the truth in the estimate it contains both of the spirit of the Prince, and of the character of the author. u The real object of Machiavel can¬ not have been to confirm upon the throne a ty¬ rant whom he detested, and against whom he had already conspired; nor is it more probable that he had a design to expose to the people the maxims of tyranny, in order to render them odious. Universal experience made them at that time sufficiently known to all Italy; and that infernal policy which Machiavel reduced to principles, was, in the sixteenth century, prac¬ tised by every government. There is rather, in his manner of treating it, a universal bitterness against mankind; a contempt of the whole hu¬ man race; which makes him address them in the language to which they had debased them¬ selves. He speaks to the interests of men, and to their selfish calculations, as if he thought it use¬ less to appeal to their enthusiasm or to their moral feelings.” I agree perfectly with M. de Sismondi in con¬ sidering the two opposite hypotheses referred to Note* in the above extract, as alike untenable; and have iuustra^ionii only to add to his remarks, that, in writing the Prince, the author seems to have been more un¬ der the influence of spleen, of ill-humour, and of blasted hopes, than of any deliberate or sys¬ tematical purpose, either favourable or adverse to human happiness. The prevailing sentiment in his mind probably was, S* populus vult decipi, decipiaiur.2 According to this view of the subject, Ma- chiavel’s Prince, instead of being considered as a new system of political morality, invented by himself, ought to be regarded merely as a di¬ gest of the maxims of state policy then univer¬ sally acted upon in the Italian courts. If I he not mistaken, it was in this light that the hook was regarded by Lord Bacon, whose opinion concerning it being, in one instance, somewhat ambiguously expressed, has been supposed by several writers of note (particularly Bayle and Mr Roscoe) to have coincided with that quoted above from Albericus Gentilis. To me it ap¬ pears, that the very turn of the sentence ap¬ pealed to on this occasion is rather disrespectful than otherwise to Machiavel’s character. <( Est itaque quod gratias agamus Machiavellio et hu- jusmodi scriptoribus, qui aperte et indissimulanter proferunt, quid homines facere soleant, non quid deheant.”—(De Aug. Scient. Lib. vii. cap. ii.) The best comment, however, on these words, is to he found in another passage of Bacon, where he has expressed his opinion of Machiavel’s mo¬ ral demerits in terms as strong and unequivocal as language can furnish. “ Quod enim ad ma- las artes attinet; si quis Machiavellio se dederit in disciplinam; qui prsecipit,” &c. &c. &c. See the rest of the paragraph (De Aug. Scient. Lib",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"It has been objected to me, that in the fore¬ going observations on the design of the Prince, I have taken no notice of the author’s vindication of himself and his writings, in his letter to Zenobius Buondelmontius, annexed to the old English translation of Machiavel, printed at London in 1675 and 1680. In the preface to this translation, we are told, that the letter in question “ had never before been published in any language, but lurked for above eighty years in the private cabinets of his own kindred, or the descendants of his admirers in Florence, till, in the Pontificate of Urban VIII., it was procured by the Jesuits and other busy bodies, and brought to Rome with an intention to divert that wise Pope from his design of making one of Nicholas Machiavel’s name and family cardinal, as (not¬ withstanding all their opposition) he did, not long after. When it was gotten into that city, it wanted not those who had the judgment and curiosity to copy it, and so at length came to en¬ joy that privilege which all rare pieces (even the sharpest libels and pasquins) challenge at that court, which is to be sold to strangers, one of which, being a gentleman of this country, brought it over with him at his return from thence in 1645, and having translated it into English, did communicate it to divers of his friends; and by means of some of them, it hath been my good fortune to be capable of making thee a present of it; and let it serve as an apology for our author and his writings, if thou th'nkest he need any.” As the translation of Machiavel, from which Notes this advertisement is copied, is still in the hands uiu *""adi(r.s of many readers in this country, it may not be improper to mention here, that the letter in question is altogether of English fabrication; and (as far as I can learn) is quite unknown on the Continent. It is reprinted at the end of the second volume of Farneworth’s Translation of Machiavel’s works, 1762, with the following statement prefixed to it.1 “ The following letter having been printed in all the editions of the old translation, it is here given to the reader, though it certainly was not written by Machiavel. It bears date in 1537, and his death is placed by all the best historians in 1530. There are, besides, in it many internal marks, which to the judicious will clearly prove it to be the work of some other writer, vainly endeavouring at the style and manner of our excellent author. The letter is indeed a spirited and judicious defence of Machiavel and his writings; but it is written in a style too inflated, and is utterly void of that elegance and precision which so much distinguish the works of the Florentine secretary.” To the author of this last translation we are farther indebted for a very curious letter of Dr Warburton’s, which renders it probable that the forgery was contrived and carried into execution by the Marquis of Wharton.

The letter is besides full of character, and describes, 1 In a letter from Warburton to the Reverend Mr Birch, there is the following passage :—“ I told you, I think, I had several of old Lord Wharton’s papers.

This parti- cular letter may be read at the end of the last volume of Pignotti’s Storia della Toscana; a book published here, but which was in all the London shops before I came away. It is to be found also with several others, which are entertaining and curious, in a new collection published at Florence in 1814, of Machiavel’s public dispatches and familiar letters. By the way, I must likewise tell Mr Stewart that my late reading has suggested a slight criticism upon one expression of his with regard to Ma¬ chiavel’s Prince^ where he calls it one of the “ latest of his publications.” The fact is, that the three great works were none of them pub¬ lished in his lifetime, nor for four years after his death. They appear to have been all writ¬ ten at the same period of his life, during the eight or ten years of leisure that were forced upon him; and I believe it may he made out from the works themselves, that the Prince was composed and finished first of the three, then the Discourses, and last of all the History. This and the first having been written for the Medicis family, the MSS. were in their hands, and they published them; the Discourses were printed by the care of some of his personal friends. If Mr Stewart wishes to have the proof of all this in detail, I can draw it out without any trouble.” The foregoing passage will he read by many with no common interest, when it is known that it formed part of a letter from the late Francis Horner, written a very few weeks be¬ fore his death. Independently of the satisfac¬ tion I feel in preserving a memorial of his kind attention to his friends, at a period when he was himself an object of such anxious solicitude to his country, I was eager to record the opi¬ nion of so perfect and accomplished a judge on a question which, for more than two centuries, has divided the learned world; and which, his profound admiration of Machiavel’s genius, com¬ bined with the most unqualified detestation of Machiavel’s principles, had led him to study with peculiar care.

But on these rare endowments of his understanding, or the still rarer combination of virtues which shed over all his mental gifts a characteristi- cal grace and a moral harmony, this is not the proper place to enlarge.

"The philosophical fame of Bacon in his own country may be dated from the establishment of the Royal Society of London; by the founders of which, as appears from their colleague, Dr Sprat, he was held in so high estimation, that it was once proposed to prefix to the history of their labours some of Bacon’s writings, as the best comment on the views with which they were undertaken. Sprat himself, and his illus¬ trious friend Cowley, were among the number of Bacon’s earliest eulogists; the latter in an Ode to the Royal Society, too well known to require any notice here; the former in a very splendid passage of his History, from which I shall borrow a few sentences, as a conclusion and ornament to this note","London, Cowley, Ode","GB,NG",8,"United Kingdom,Nigeria","Europe,Africa"

"I have alluded, in the text, to the difference between the popular and the scholastic notion of substance. According to the latter, the word substance corresponds to the Greek word ouova, as employed by Aristotle to denote the first of the predicaments; in which technical sense it is said, in the language of the schools, to signify that which supports attributes, or which is sub¬ ject to accidents. At a period when every person liberally educated was accustomed to this bar¬ barous jargon, it might not appear altogether absurd to apply the term substance to the human soul, or even to the Deity. But, in the present times, a writer who so employs it may be as¬ sured, that, to a great majority of his readers, it will be no less puzzling than it was to Crambe, in Martinus Scriblerus, when he first heard it thus defined by his master Cornelius.1 How extraordinary does the following sentence now sound even to a philosophical ear ? and yet it is copied from a work published little more than seventy years ago, by the learned and judicious Gravesande: Substantiae sunt aut cogitantes, aut non cogitantes; cogitantes duas novimus, 1 “ When he was told, a substance was that which was subject to accidents, then soldiers, quoth Cramhe, are the most sub¬ stantial people in the world.” Let me add, that, in the list of philosophical reformers, the authors of Martinus Scriblerus ought not to be overlooked. Their happy ridicule of the scholastic Logic and Metaphysics is universally known ; but few are aware of the acuteness and sagacity displayed in their allusions to some of the most vulnerable passages in Locke’s Essav.

"The constant influx of information and of libera¬ lity from abroad, which was thus kept up in Scotland in consequence of the ancient habits and manners of the people, may help to account for the sudden burst of genius, which to a foreigner must seem to have sprung up in this country by a sort of enchantment, soon after the Rebellion of 1745. The great step then made was in the art of English composition. In the mathematical sciences, where the graces of writ¬ ing have no place, Scotland, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, was never, from the time of Neper, left behind by any country in Europe; nor ought it to be forgotten, that the philosophy of Newton was publicly taught by David Gregory at Edinburgh, and by his brother James Gregory at St Andrew’s, before it was able to supplant the vortices of Descartes in that very university of which Newton was a member.1 The case was similar in every other liberal pur¬ suit, where an ignorance of the delicacies of the English tongue was not an insuperable bar to distinction. Even in the study of eloquence, as far as it was attainable in their own vernacular idiom, some of the Scottish pleaders, about the era when the two kingdoms were united, seem ambitiously, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to have formed themselves upon models, which, in modern times, it has been commonly suppos¬ ed to be more safe to admire than to imitate.2 Of the progress made in this part of the island 1 For this we have the authority of Whiston, the immediate successor of Sir Isaac Newton in the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge; and of Dr Reid, who was a nephew of the two Gregorys. “ Mr Gregory had already caused several of his scholars to keep Acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian Philosophy ; while we at Cambridge, poor wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesians.”—(Whiston’s Memoirs of his own Life.) “ I have by me,”says Dr Reid, “a Thesis printed at Edinburgh, 1690, by James Gregory, who was at that time Pro¬ fessor of Philosophy at St Andrew’s, containing twenty-five positions; the first three relating to logic, and the abuse of it in the Aristotelian and Cartesian philosophy. The remaining twenty-two positions are a compend of Newton’s Principia","Newton, Edinburgh, Newton, Of, Newton, Cambridge, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Newton","US,GB,UK,TR",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A,Turkey","North America,Europe,N/A,Asia"

"In the course of her argument on this subject, she endeavours to astonish her judges by an ironical display of her philosophical knowledge ; warning them of the extreme difficulty and nicety of the question upon which they were about to pronounce. “ Yous voulez juger de moi! mais, pour juger sainement, il faut une grande eten- due de connoissances; encore est il hien dou- teux qu’il y en ait de certaines Avant done que vous entrepreniez de prononcer sur mon sujet, je deman de prealablement que vous exa- miniez avec moi nos connoissances en general, les degres de ces connoissances, leur etendue, leur realite; que nous convenions de ce que e’est que la verite, et si la verite se trouve effective- ment. Apres quoi nous traiterons des proposi¬ tions universelles, des maximes, des proposi¬ tions frivoles, et de la foiblesse, ou de la solidite de nos lumieres Quelque personnes tiennent pour verite, que 1’homme nait avec cer¬ tains principes inees, certaines notions primitives, certains caracteres qui sont comme graves dans son espi’it, des le premier instant de son exist¬ ence. Pour moi, j’ai longtemps examine ce sentiment, et j’entreprends de la combattre, de le refuter, de Taneantir, si vous avez la patience de m’ecouter.” I have transcribed hut a part of this curious pleading; but, I presume, more than enough to show, that every sentence, and almost every word of it, refers to Locke’s doc¬ trines. In the second and third sentences, the titles of the principal chapters in the fourth book of his Essay are exactly copied. It was impos¬ sible that such a scene should have produced the slightest comic effect, unless the hook alluded to had been in very general circulation among the higher orders; I might perhaps add, in much more general circulation than it ever obtained among that class of readers in England.

"The prevailing misapprehensions with respect to this, and some other principles of the Carte¬ sian metaphysics, can only be accounted for by supposing, that the opinions of Descartes have been more frequently j udged of from the glosses of his followers, than from his own works. It seems to have never been sufficiently known to his adversaries, either in France or in England, that, after his philosophy had become fashion¬ able in Holland, a number of Dutch divines, whose opinions differed very widely from his, found it convenient to shelter their own errors under his established name; and that some of them went so far as to avail themselves of his authority in propagating tenets directly oppo¬ site to his declared sentiments. Hence a dis¬ tinction of the Cartesians into the genuine and the josewcfo-Cartesians; and hence an inconsis¬ tency in their representations of the metaphysi¬ cal ideas of their master, which can only be cleared up by a reference (seldom thought of) to his own very concise and perspicuous text",Holland,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Mr Locke seems to have considered this use of the word reflection as peculiar to himself; but it is perfectly analogous to the %ivr\(Siig xuxXhca/ of the Greek philosophers, and to various expres¬ sions which occur in the works of John Smith of Cambridge, and of Dr Cudworth.

"The only circumstance which renders these Notes worthy of preservation, is the record they furnish of Locke’s forbearance and courtesy, in managing a controversy carried on, upon the other side, with so much captiousness and aspe¬ rity. An Irish bishop, in a letter on this sub¬ ject to Mr Molyneux, writes thus: “ I read Mr Locke’s letter to the Bishop of Worcester with great satisfaction, and am wholly of your opi¬ nion, that he has fairly laid the great bishop on his back, but it is with so much gentleness, as if he were afraid not only of hurting him, hut even of spoiling or tumbling his clothes.” The work of Lee is entitled “ Anti-scepticism, or Notes upon each chapter of Mr Locke’s Es¬ say concerning Human Understanding, with an explanation of all the particulars of which he treats, and in the same order.

"For the information of some of my readers, it may be proper to observe, that the word influx came to be employed to denote the action of body and soul on each other, in consequence of a pre¬ vailing theory which supposed that this action was carried on by something intermediate (whe¬ ther material or immaterial was not positively decided) flowing from the one substance to the other. It is in this sense that the word is un¬ derstood by Leibnitz, when he states as an in¬ surmountable objection to the theory of influx, that “ it is impossible to conceive either mate¬ rial particles or immaterial qualities to pass from body to mind, or from mind to body.” Instead of the term influx, that of influence came gradually to be substituted by our English writers; but the two words were originally synonymous, and were used indiscriminately as late as the time of Sir Matthew Hale.—(See his Primitive Origination of Mankind.) In Johnson’s Dictionary, the primitive and radical meaning assigned to the word influence (which he considers as of French extraction) is “ the power of the celestial aspects operating upon terrestrial bodies and affairsand in the Encyclopaedia of Chambers, it is defined to be “ a quality supposed to flow from the bodies of the stars, either with their heat or light, to which astrologers vainly attribute all the events which happen on the earth.” To this astrolo¬ gical use of the word Milton had plainly a re¬ ference in that fine expression of his L’ Allegro, “ Store of ladies whose bright eyes “ Rain influence.1""1 It is a circumstance worthy of notice, that a word thus originating in the dreams of astro- r The explanation of the word influence, given in the Dictionary of the French Academy, accords perfectly with the tenor of the above remarks. “ Yertu qui, suivant les Astrologues, decoule des Astres sur les corps sublunaires.” DISSERTATION FIRST","Hale, Milton","GB,US,UK,FR",8,"United Kingdom,United States,N/A,France","Europe,North America,N/A,Europe"

But his imagination soon took a bolder flight, and gave birth to his Protogo&a ;—a dissertation which (to use his own words) had for its object “ to ascertain the ori¬ ginal face of the earth, and to collect the ves¬ tiges of its earliest history from the monuments which nature herself has left of her successive operations on its surface.” It is a work which, wild and extravagant as it may now he regard- Notes ed, is spoken of by Buffon with much respect; IUu “adtiong> and is considered hy Cuvier as the ground-work of Buffon’s own system on the same subject",Brunswick,"DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"

Upon these verses the only comment which I have to offer is a remark of the apostle Peter* that “ In the epistles of our beloved brother Paul are some things hard to he understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest unto their own destruction.” The same similitude of the potter makes a con- Notes spicuous figure in the writings of Hobbes, who iiiust""adtiong has availed himself of this, as of many other in- sulated passages of Holy Writ, in support of principles which are now universally allowed to strike at the very root of religion and mora¬ lity.

It cannot, however, he candidly supposed, that Cowley understood the whole drift of Hobbes’ doctrines. The contrary, indeed, in the present instance, is obvious from the ode before us; for while Cowley supposed the angels to move, like chess-men, the inhabitants of this globe, Hobbes (along with Spinoza) plainly conceived that the angels themselves, and even that Being to which he impiously gave the name of God, were all of them moved, like knights and pawns, by the invisible hand of fate or ne¬ cessity","Cowley, Cowley, Cowley",GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"« The Clavis Universalis of Arthur Collier, though little known in England, has been trans¬ lated into German. It is published in a work entitled “ Samlung” &c. &c. literally, “ A Col¬ lection of the most distinguished Authors who deny the existence of their own bodies, and of the whole material world,—containing the dialogues of Berkeley, between Hylas and Phi- lonous, and Collier’s Universal Key translated, with Illustrative Observations, and an Appendix, wherein the existence of Body is demonstrated, by John Christopher Eschenhach, Professor of Philosophy in Rostock.” (Rostock, 1756, 8vo.) The remarks are numerous, and show much reading. The Appendix contains, 1. An ex¬ position of the opinion of the Idealists, with its grounds and arguments 2. A proof of the external existence of body. The argument on which he chiefly dwells to show the existence of matter is the same with that of Hr Reid, in so far as he says, “ a direct proof must not here he expected; in regard to the fundamental prin ciples of human nature, this is seldom possible, or rather is absolutely impossible.” He argues at length, that the Idealist has no better proof of the existence of his soul than of the existence of his body; “ when an Idealist says, lama thinking being; of this I am certain from internal conviction ;—I would ask from whence he derives this certainty, and why he excludes from this conviction the possi¬ bility of deception ? He has no other answer than this, I feel it. It is impossible that I can have any representation of self without the consciousness of being a thinking being.

"46, 47.) A late author2 has very justly reprobated that spiritual deification of nature which has been long fashionable among the French, and which, according to his own account, is at present not unfashionable in Germany. It is proper, how¬ ever, to observe, that this mode of speaking has been used by two very ditferent classes of wri¬ ters ; by the one with an intention to keep as much as possible the Deity out of their view, while studying his works; by the other, as a convenient and well understood metaphor, by means of which the frequent and irreverent mention of the name of God is avoided in philo¬ sophical arguments. It was with this last view, undoubtedly, that it was so often employed by Newton, and other English philosophers of the same school. In general, when we find a wri¬ ter speaking of the wise or of the benevolent in¬ tentions of nature, we should be slow in imput¬ ing to him any leaning towards atheism. Many of the finest instances of Final Causes, it is cer¬ tain, which the eighteenth century has brought to light, have been first remarked by inquirers who seem to have been fond of this phraseology; and of these inquirers, it is possible that some would have been less forward in bearing testi¬ mony to the truth, had they been forced to avail themselves of the style of theologians.

Idea itaque tem¬ poris est intuitus, et quoniam ante omnem sensa- tionem concipitur, tanquam conditio respectuum in sensibilibus obviorum, est intuitus, non sen- sualis, sed purus. 4. Tempus est quantum conti¬ nuum et legum continui in mutationibus universi principium. 5. Tempus non est objectivum aliquid etreale, nec substantia, necaccidens, necrelatio, sed subjectiva conditio, per naturam mentis humanse necessaria, quaelibet sensibilia, certa lege sibi co- ordinandi, et intuitus purus. 6. Tempus est conceptus verissimus, et, per omnia possibilia sensuum objecta, in infinitum patens, intuitivee repraesentationis conditio. 7. Tempus itaque est Notes principium fonnale mundi sensibilis absolute pri- iuus^ion mum.” With respect to Space, Kant states a series of similar propositions, ascribing to it very nearly the same metaphysical attributes as to Time, and running as far as possible a sort of parallel be¬ tween them. 44 A. Conceptus spatii non abstrahi- tur a sensationibus externis. B. Conceptus spatii est singularis reprcesentatio omnia in se compre- hendens, non sub se continens notio abstracta et communis. C. Conceptus spatii itaque est intuitus purus; cum sit conceptus singularis; sensa¬ tionibus non conflatus, sed omnis sensationis ex- ternae forma fundamentalis. D. Spatium non est aliquid objectivi et realis, nec substantia, nec accidens, nec relatio; sed subjectivum et ideale, e natura mentis stabili lege proficiscens, veluti schema, omnia omnino externe sensa sibi co-ordinandi. E. Quanquam conceptus spatii, ut objectivi alicujus et realis entis vel affectio- nis, sit imaginarius, nihilo tamen secius respec¬ tive ad sensibilia qucecunque, non solum est ve¬ rissimus, sed et omnis veritatis in sensiuilitate externa fundamentum.” These propositions are extracted from a Dis¬ sertation written by Kant himself in the Latin language.1 Their obscurity, therefore, eanno* be ascribed to any misapprehension on the part of a translator. It was on this account that I thought it better to quote them in his own un¬ altered words, than to avail myself of the cor¬ responding passage in Born’s Latin version of the Critique of Pure Reason","Kant, Kant, Kant, Born","KG,NL",8,"Kyrgyzstan,Netherlands","Asia,Europe"

"283 Notes originally imported the seeds of Transcenden- Iiius'radons.TAL Philosophy from its native country, to plant them in our soil; and though, as is usually the case, many of those seeds were scattered by the wind, I trust that a sufficient number have taken root to maintain the growth of this vigo¬ rous and flourishing plant, till the time shall come, when, by its general cultivation, England may be enabled to enrich other nations with the most perfect specimens of its produce. Professor Nitsch, who thus bestowed upon our country her first attainments in the department of Pure Science, has paid the debt of nature. I confess it is some reflection upon England, that she did not foster and protect this immediate disciple of the father of philosophy; but the necessities of this learned and illustrious man unfortunately compelled him to seek that subsistence else¬ where, which was withheld from him here. At Rostock, about the year 1813, this valuable member of society, and perfect master of the philosophy he undertook to teach, entered upon his immortal career as a reward for his earthly services. It is with the most heartfelt satisfac¬ tion that I add my mite of praise to his revered memory.

"Among the secondary mischiefs resulting from the temporary popularity of Kant, none is more to be regretted than the influence of his works on the habits, both of thinking and of writing, of some very eminent men, who have since given to the world histories of philosophy. That of Tenneman in particular (a work said to possess great merit) would appear to have been vitiated by this unfortunate bias in the views of its author. A very competent judge has said of it, that <c it affords, as far as it is completed, the most accurate, the most minute, and the most rational view we yet possess of the different systems of philosophy; but that the critical philosophy being chosen as the vantage ground from whence the survey of former systems is taken, the continual reference in Kant’s own language to his peculiar doctrines, renders it frequently impossible for those who have not Notes studied the dark works of this modern Heracli- iiius^alions tus to understand the strictures of the historian on the systems even of Aristotle or Plato.” (See the article Brucker in the Encyclo- pcedia Britannica, 7th Ed.) We are told by the same writer, that “ among the learned of Germany, Brucker has never enjoyed a very distinguished reputation.” This I can very easily credit; but I am more inclined to in¬ terpret it to the disadvantage of the German taste, than to that of the historian. Brucker is indeed not distinguished by any extraordinary measure of depth or of acuteness; but in indus¬ try, fidelity, and sound judgment, he has few superiors; qualities of infinitely greater value in the undertaker of a historical work, than that passion for systematical refinement, which is so apt to betray the best-intentioned writers into false glosses on the opinions they record","Kant, Kant, Plato","DE,KG,CO",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan,Colombia","Europe,Asia,South America"
"When the above passage was written, I had not seen the work of Buhle. I have since had an opportunity of looking into the French trans¬ lation of it, published at Paris in 1816; and I must frankly acknowledge, that I have seldom met with a greater disappointment. The account there given of the Kantian system, to which I turned with peculiar eagerness, has, if possible, involved to my apprehension, in additional ob¬ scurity, that mysterious doctrine. From this, however, I did not feel myself entitled to form an estimate of the author’s merits as a philo¬ sophical historian, till I had read some other articles of which I considered myself better qualified to j udge.

"Sismondi, in mentioning the history of mo¬ dern literature by Bouterwek, takes occasion to pay a compliment (and, I have no doubt, a very deserved one) to German scholars in general; observing, that he has executed his task—“ avec une etendue d’erudition, et une hyaute dans la maniere ix en faire profiter ses lecteurs, qui Notes semhlent propres aux savans Allemands.”— [iiUS(r'atjoni!

"Lord Stair’s Physiologia Nova Experimentalis (published at Leyden in 1686) is also worthy of notice in the literary history of Scotland. Al¬ though it bears few marks of the eminent ta¬ lents which distinguished the author, both as a lawyer and as a statesman, it discovers a very extensive acquaintance with the metaphysical as well as with the physical doctrines, which were chiefly in vogue at that period; more par¬ ticularly with the leading doctrines of Gassendi, Descartes, and Malebranche. Many acute and some important strictures are made on the errors of all the three, and at the same time complete j ustice is done to their merits; the writer every where manifesting an indepen¬ dence of opinion and a spirit of free inquiry, very uncommon among the philosophers of the seventeenth century.

But his love of the subject, his natural wish to preserve some of his early reading and reflec¬ tions, and the entreaties of Mr Napier, who had a few years before been introduced to him by Mr Stewart, and with whom he was in the habit of corresponding, prevailed over his scruples, and an agreement in consequence took place for the execution of an historical Dissertation, embracing this object, and extending over the period that had been left untouched by his predecessor. It had originally been agreed, as above stated, that the Dissertation should include political as well as ethical philosophy, but the au¬ thor’s uncertain health, and the parliamentary duties of an interesting crisis, occasioned the abandonment of this part of the plan, and even obliged him to omit the history of the ethical philosophy of the Continent",Napier,"NZ,GB",8,"New Zealand,United Kingdom","Oceania,Europe"

"34.) If the word from which Deontology is de¬ rived had borrowed its meaning from the notion of utility alone, it is not likely that it would have become more intelligible by being translated out of Latin into Greek. But the term Deontology expresses Moral Science (and expresses it well), precisely because it signifies the Science of Duty, and contains no reference to utility. It is a term well chosen, to describe a system of ethics founded on any other than Mr Bentham’s principle. Mac¬ kintosh, who held that ro d'eov,—what men ought to do,—was the fundamental notion of morality, might very properly have termed the science Deontology. The system of which Mr Bentham is the representative—that of those who make 1 The title of this hook is “Deontology, &c., from the MSS. of Jeremy Bentham;” but recently I have been blamed in a Review for citing it as his. (1852.) 2 Perhaps the reader may be amused by Mr Bentham’s mode of winding up the scene :—“Thereupon the modern kicks the ancient, or spits in his face ; or, if he is strong enough, throws him behind the fire. One can think of] no other method that is at once natural and consistent, of continuing the debate.” It is satisfactory to see that Mr Bentham does not seem to have thought the use of the word ought by the one party, though very provoking, justified the extreme measures which he describes on the other side",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"301 morality dependent on the production of happi¬ ness, has long been designated in Germany by the term Eudemonism, derived from the Greek word for happiness (ivbcufiovia). If we were to adopt this term we should have to oppose the Deontological to the Eudemonist school; and we must necessa¬ rily place those who hold a peculiar moral faculty, —Butler, Stewart, Brown, Mackintosh,—in the former, and those who are usually called utilita¬ rian philosophers in the latter class",,"DE,GR",8,"Germany,Greece","Europe,Europe"
"definition is faintly and but occasionally present, naturally suffers, in the ordinary state of atten¬ tion, the scientific meaning to disappear from remembrance, and insensibly ascribes to the word a great part, if not the whole, of that po¬ pular sense which is so very much more familiar even to the most veteran speculator. The ob¬ stacles which stood in the way of Lucretius and Cicero, when they began to translate the subtile philosophy of Greece into their narrow and bar¬ ren tongue, are always felt by the philosopher when he struggles to express, with the neces¬ sary discrimination, his abstruse reasonings in words which, though those of his own language, be must take from the mouths of those to whom his distinctions would be without meaning",Cicero,"GR,US",8,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"It is only by examining the history of ancient Philosophy that the probable origin of this name will be found, in the application of it, as the running title of several essays of Aristotle, which were placed in a collection of the manu¬ scripts of that great philosopher, after his trea¬ tise on Physics. It has the greater fault of an unsteady and fluctuating signification ; denoting one class of objects in the seventeenth century, and another in the eighteenth—even in the nineteenth not quite of the same import in the mouth of a German, as in that of a French or English philosopher; to say nothing of the far¬ ther objection that it continues to be a badge of undue pretension among some of the followers of the science, while it has become a name of reproach and derision among those who alto¬ gether decry it",,"DE,FR,UK",8,"Germany,France,N/A","Europe,Europe,N/A"

The intercommunity of the technical terms of science in Europe has been so far broken down by the Germans, and the influence of their literature and philosophy is so rapidly increasing in the greater part of the Continent, that though a revolution in scientific nomenclature be pro¬ bably yet far distant, tbe foundation of it may be considered as already prepared",,GR,8,Greece,Europe

No controversy seems to have arisen regarding it in Greece, till the rise and conflict of the Stoical and Epicurean schools; and the ethical disputes of the modern world originated with the writings of Hobbes about the middle of the seventeenth century.

We know little of them but from Cicero, the trans¬ lator of Grecian philosophy, and from the Greek compilers of a later age; authorities which would be imperfect in the history of facts, but which are of far less value in the history of opinions, where a right conception often depends upon the minutest distinctions between words",Cicero,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"There is no scene in history so memorable as that in which Caesar mastered a nobility of which Lucullus and Hortensius, Sulpicius and Catulus, Pompey and Cicero, Brutus and Cato, were members. This renowned body had from the time of Scipio sought the Greek philosophy as an amusement or an ornament. Some few, <c in thought more elevate,” caught the love of truth, and were ambitious of discovering a solid foundation for the Rule of Life. The influence of the Grecian systems was tried by their effect on a body of men of the utmost originality, energy, and variety of character, during the five centuries between Carneades and Constantine, in their successive positions of rulers of the world, and of slaves under the best and under the worst of uncontrolled masters. If we had found this in¬ fluence perfectly uniform, we should have justly suspected our own love of system of having in part bestowed that appearance on it. Had there been no trace of such an influence discoverable in so great an experiment, we must have acquiesced in the paradox, that opinion does not at all affect conduct. The result is the more satisfactory, because it appears to illustrate general tendency without excluding very remarkable exceptions","Cicero, Constantine","US,DZ,GR",8,"United States,Algeria,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"
"Though Cassius was an Epicurean, the true re¬ presentative of that school was the accomplished, prudent, friendly, good-natured timeserver At- ticus, the pliant slave of every tyrant, who could kiss the hand of Antony, imbrued as it was in the blood of Cicero. The pure school of Plato sent forth Marcus Brutus, the signal humanity of whose life was both necessary and sufficient to prove that his daring breach of venerable rules flowed only from that dire necessity which left no other means of upholding the most sacred principles. The Roman orator, though in spe¬ culative questions ho embraced that mitigated doubt which allowed most ease and freedom to his genius, yet in those moral writings where his heart was most deeply interested, followed the severest sect of philosophy, and became al¬ most a Stoic. If any conclusion may he ha¬ zarded from this trial of systems, the greatest which history has recorded, we must not refuse our decided though not undistinguishing pre¬ ference to that noble school which preserved great souls untainted at the court of dissolute and ferocious tyrants; which exalted the slave of one of Nero’s courtiers to he a moral teacher of aftertimes; which for the first, and hitherto for the only time, breathed philosophy and jus¬ tice into those rules of law which govern the ordinary concerns of every man; and which, above all, has contributed, by the examples of Marcus Porcius Cato and of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, to raise the dignity of our species, to keep alive a more ardent love of virtue, and a more awful sense of duty, throughout all ge¬ nerations. 1 4 The result of this short review of the practi¬ cal philosophy of Greece seems to be, that though it was rich in rules for the conduct of life, and in exhibitions of the beauty of virtue, and though it contains glimpses of j ust theory and fragments of perhaps every moral truth, yet it did not leave behind any precise and coherent system; un¬ less we except that of Epicurus, who purchased consistency, method, and perspicuity too dearly by the sacrifice of truth, and by narrowing and lowering his views of human nature, so as to enfeeble, if not extinguish, all the vigorous mo¬ tives to arduous virtue. It is remarkable, that while of the eight Professors who taught in the Porch, from Zeno to Posidonius, everyone either softened or exaggerated the doctrines of his pre¬ decessor ; and while the beautiful and reverend philosophy of Plato had, in his own Academy, degenerated into a scepticism which did not spare morality itself, the system of Epicurus re¬ mained without change; and his disciples con¬ tinued for ages to show personal honours to his memory, in a manner which may seem unac¬ countable among those who were taught to measure propriety by a calculation of palpable _1 Of all testimonies to the character of the Stoics, perhaps the most decisive is the speech of the vile sycophant Ca- pito, in the mock impeachment of Thrasea Paetus, before a senate of slaves: “ Ut quondam C.

"and outward usefulness. This steady adhe¬ rence is in part doubtless attributable to the por¬ tion of truth which the doctrine contains; in some degree perhaps to the amiable and unboast¬ ful character of Epicurus; not a little, it may be, to the dishonour of deserting an unpopular cause 5 but probably most of all to that mental indolence which disposes the mind to rest in a simple system, comprehended at a glance, and easily falling in, both with ordinary maxims of discretion, and with the vulgar commonplaces of satire on human nature.1 When all instruc¬ tion was conveyed by lectures, and when one master taught the whole circle of the sciences in one school, it was natural that the attachment of pupils to a Professor should be more devoted than when, as in our times, he can teach only a small portion of a knowledge spreading towards infinity, and even in his own little province finds a rival in every good writer who has treat¬ ed the same subject. The superior attachment of the Epicureans to their master is not without some parallel among the followers of similar principles in our own age, who have also re¬ vived some part of that indifference to eloquence and poetry which may be imputed to the habit of contemplating all things in relation to happi¬ ness, and to (what seems its uniform effect) the egregious miscalculation which leaves a multi¬ tude of mental pleasures out of the account. It may be said, indeed, that the Epicurean doctrine has continued with little change to the present day ; at least it is certain that no other ancient doctrine has proved so capable of being restored in the same form among the moderns; and it may be added, that Hobbes and Gassendi, as well as some of our own contemporaries, are as confident in their opinions, and as intolerant of scepticism, as the old Epicureans. The resem¬ blance of modern to ancient opinions, concern¬ ing some of those questions upon which ethical controversy must always hinge, may be a suf¬ ficient excuse for a retrospect of the Greek mo¬ rals ; which it is hoped will simplify and shorten subsequent observation on those more recent disputes which form the proper subject of this discourse",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"The genius of Greece fell with liberty. The Grecian philosophy received its mortal wound in the contests between scepticism and dogma¬ tism which occupied the schools in the age of Cicero. The Sceptics could only perplex, and confute, and destroy. Their occupation was gone as soon as they succeeded. They had nothing to substitute for what they overthrew; and they rendered their own art of no further use. They were no more than venomous ani¬ mals, who stung their victims to death, but also breathed their last into the wound. A third age of Grecian literature indeed arose at Alex¬ andria, under the Macedonian kings of Egypt; laudably distinguished by exposition, criticism, and imitation, sometimes abused for the pur¬ poses of literary forgery, still more honoured by some learned and highly-cultivated poets, as well as by diligent cultivators of history and science; among whom some began about the first preaching of Christianity to turn their minds once more to that high philosophy which seeks for the fundamental principles of human knowledge. Philo, a learned and philosophical Hebrew, one of the flourishing colony of his na¬ tion established in that city, endeavoured to re¬ concile the Platonic Philosophy with the Mosaic Law and the Sacred Books of the Old Testa¬ ment. About the end of the second century, when the Christians, Hebrews, Pagans, and va¬ rious other sects of semi or Pseudo-Christian Gnostics appear to have studied in the same schools, the almost inevitable tendency of doc¬ trines, however discordant, in such circum¬ stances to amalgamate, produced its full effect under Ammonius Saccas; a celebrated Professor, who, by selection from the Greek systems, the Hebrew books, the oriental religions, and by some of that concession to the rising spirit of Christi¬ anity, of which the Gnostics had set the example, composed a very mixed system, commonly de- 1 The progress of commonplace satire on sexes or professions, and (he might have added) on nations, has been exquisitely touched by Gray in his Remarks on Lydgate ; a fragment containing passages as finely thought and written as any in Eng¬ lish prose.

"An interval of a thousand years elapsed be¬ tween the close of ancient and the rise of modern philosophy; the most unexplored, yet not the least instructive portion of the history of Euro¬ pean opinion. In that period the sources of the institutions, the manners, the characteristic dis¬ tinctions of modern nations, have been traced by a series of philosophical inquirers from Mon¬ tesquieu to Hal lam; and there also, it may be added, more than among the ancients, are the wellsprings of our speculative doctrines and controversies. Far from being inactive, the hu¬ man mind, during that period of exaggerated darkness, produced discoveries in science, in¬ ventions in art, and contrivances in government, some of which, perhaps, were rather favoured than hindered by the disorders of society, and by the twilight in which men and things were seen. Had Boethius, the last of the ancients, foreseen, that within two centuries of his death, in the province of Britain, then a prey to all the horrors of barbaric invasion, a chief of one of the fiercest tribes of barbarians should trans¬ late into the jargon of his freebooters the work on The Consolations of Philosophy, of which the composition had soothed the cruel imprisonment of the philosophic Roman himself, he must, even amidst his sufferings, have derived some grati¬ fication from such an assurance of the recovery of mankind from ferocity and ignorance. But had he been allowed to revisit the earth in the middle of the sixteenth century, with what wonder and delight might he have contemplated the new and fairer order which was beginning to disclose its beauty, and to promise more than it revealed. He would have seen personal sla¬ very nearly extinguished, and women, first re¬ leased from oriental imprisonment by the Greeks, and raised to a higher dignity among the Ro¬ mans,5 at length fast approaching to due equa¬ lity ; two revolutions the most signal and be¬ neficial since the dawn of civilisation.

In the midst of all the obloquy and opprobrium with which he loads that people, his tone suddenly rises when he comes to contemplate them as the only nation who paid religious honours to the supreme and eternal mind alone, and his style swells at the sight of so sublime and wonderful a scene. “ Summum Ulud atque seternum, neque mutabile neque interiturum.” 2 The punishment of death was inflicted on Pagans by a law of Constantius. “ Volumus cunctos sacrificiis abstinere","Mon, Roman","IN,RO",8,"India,Romania","Asia,Europe"

"The Augustinian doctrines of original sin, pre¬ destination, and grace, little known to the ear¬ lier Christian writers, who appear indeed to have adopted opposite and milder opinions, were espoused by Augustin himself in his old age; when by a violent swing from his youthful Mauicheism, which divided the sovereignty of the world between two adverse beings, he did not shrink, in his pious solicitude for tracing the power of God in all events, from presenting the most mysterious parts of the moral govern¬ ment of the universe, in their darkest colours and their sternest shape, as articles of faith, the objects of the habitual meditation and practical assent of mankind. The principles of his rigor¬ ous system, though not with all their legitimate consequences, were taught in the schools; re¬ spectfully promulgated rather than much incul¬ cated by the western church (for in the East these opinions seem to have been unknown); scarcely perhaps distinctly assented to by the majority of the clergy; and seldom heard of by laymen till the systematic genius and fervid eloquence of Calvin rendered them a popular creed in the most devout and moral portion of the Christian world. Anselm,2 the Piedmontese archbishop of Canterbury, was the earliest re¬ viver of the Augustinian opinions. Aquinas3 was their most redoubted champion. To them, however, the latter joined others of a different spirit. Faith, according to him, was a virtue, not in the sense in which it denotes the things believed, but in that in which it signifies the state of mind which leads to right belief. Good¬ ness he regarded as the moving principle of the Divine government; justice, as a modification of goodness; and, with all his zeal to magnify the sovereignty of God, he yet taught, that though God always wills what is just, nothing is j ust solely because he wills it. Scotus,4 the most subtile of doctors, recoils from the Augus¬ tinian rigour, though he rather intimates than avows his doubts. He was assailed for his ten¬ dency towards the Pelagian or Anti-Augusti- nian doctrines by many opponents, of whom the most famous in his time was Thomas Brad- wardine,5 archbishop of Canterbury, formerly confessor of Edward III., whose defence of pre¬ destination was among the most noted works of that age. He revived the principles of the an¬ cient philosophers, who, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius, taught that error of judgment, being involuntary, is not the proper subject of moral disapprobation; which indeed is implied in Aquinas’s account of faith.6 But he appears to have been the first whose language inclined to- 1 Notes and Illustrations, note B","Canterbury, Canterbury, Plato","GB,CO",8,"United Kingdom,Colombia","Europe,South America"

Whether he was a native of Dunston in Northumberland, or of Dunse in Berwickshire, or of Down in Ireland, was a question long and warmly contested, but which seems to be settled by his biographer, Luke Wadding, who quotes a passage of Scotus’s Commentary on Aris¬ totle’s Metaphysics, where he illustrates his author thus : “ As in the definition of St Francis, or St Patrick, man is ne¬ cessarily presupposed.” (Scoti Opera, I. 3.)

"Though these still continued to be published, yet the most remarkable moralists of the six¬ teenth century indicated the approach of other modes of thinking, by the adoption of the more independent titles of Treatises on Justice and Law. These titles were suggested, and the spirit, contents, and style of the writings them¬ selves, were materially affected by the improved cultivation of the Roman law, by the renewed study of ancient literature, and by the revival of various systems of Greek philosophy, now studied in the original, which at once mitigated and rivalled the scholastic doctors, and while they rendered philosophy more free, re-opened its communications with society and affairs.

"Many of these writers treated the law of war and the practice of hostilities in a juridical form.1 Francis Victoria, who began to teach at Valla¬ dolid in 1525, is said to have first expounded the doctrines of the schools in the language of the age of Leo the Tenth. Dominic Soto,2 * a Do¬ minican, the confessor of Charles V., and the oracle of the Council of Trent, to whom that assembly were indebted for much of the preci¬ sion and even elegance for which their doctrinal decrees are not unjustly commended, dedicated his treatise on Justice and Law to Don Car¬ los ; in terms of praise which, used hy a writer who is said to have declined the high dignities of the church, lead us to hope that he was un¬ acquainted with the brutish vices of that wretch¬ ed prince. It is a concise and not inelegant compound of the scholastic Ethics, which con¬ tinued to be of considerable authority for more than a century.5 Both he and his master Vic¬ toria deserve to be had in everlasting remem- tyance, for the part which they took on behalt of the natives of America and of Africa, against the rapacity and cruelty of the Spaniards. Vic¬ toria pronounced war against the Americans for their vices or for their paganism to be unjust.4 Soto was the authority chiefly consulted by Charles V., on occasion of the conference held before him at Valladolid, in 1542, between Se¬ pulveda, an advocate of the Spanish colonists, and Las Casas, the champion of the unhappy Americans ; of which the result was a very im¬ perfect edict of reformation in 1543, which, though it contained little more than a recogni¬ tion of the principle of justice, almost excited a rebellion in Mexico. Sepulveda, a scholar and a reasoner, advanced many maxims which were specious, and in themselves reasonable, but which practically tended to defeat even the scanty and almost illusive reform which en¬ sued. Las Casas was a passionate missionary, whose zeal, kindled by the long and near con¬ templation of cruelty, prompted him to exagge¬ rations of fact and argument;5 yet, with all its errors, it afforded the only hope of preserving the natives of America from extirpation. The opin¬ ion of Soto could not fail to be conformable to his excellent principle, that “ there can be no difference between Christians and Pagans, for the law of nations is equal to all nations.”6 To Soto belongs the signal honour of being the first writer who condemned the African slave-trade","Vic, Vic, Valladolid","ES,MX",8,"Spain,Mexico","Europe,North America"

"The introduction to the great work of Gro¬ tius, 6 composed in the first years of his exile, and published at Paris in 1625, contains the most clear and authentic statement of the general principles of morals prevalent in Christendom after the close of the schools, and before the writings of Hobbes had given rise to those ethi¬ cal controversies which more peculiarly belong to modern times. That he may lay down the fundamental principles of Ethics, he introduces Carneades on the stage as denying altogether the reality of moral distinctions; teaching that law and morality are contrived by powerful men for their own interest; that they vary in differ¬ ent countries, and change in successive ages; that there can be no natural law, since nature leads men as well as other animals to prefer their own interest to every other object; that therefore there is either no justice, or if there be, it is another name for the height of folly, 1 Born in 1538; died in 1617- 2 “ Tantse subtilitatis philosophum et theologum, ut vix quemquam habeat parent.” (Grotii Epist. apud Anton.

"Dr Richard Cumberland,2 raised to the see of Peterborough after the revolution of 1688, was the only professed answerer of Hobbes. His work on the Law of Nature still retains a place on the shelf, though not often on the desk. The philosophical epigrams of Hobbes form a con¬ trast to the verbose, prolix, and languid diction of his answerer. The forms of scholastic argu¬ ment serve more to encumber his style than to insure his exactness. But he has substantial merits. He justly observes, that all men can only be said to have had originally a right to all things, in a sense in which right has the same meaning with power. He shows that Hobbes is at variance with himself; inasmuch as the dic¬ tates of right reason, which, by his own state¬ ment, teach men for their own safety to forego the exercise of that right, and which he calls Laws of Nature, are coeval with it; and that mankind perceive the moral limits of their power as clearly and as soon as they are conscious of its existence. He enlarges the intimations of Grotius on the social feelings, which prompt men to the pleasures of pacific intercourse, as certainly as the apprehension of danger and de¬ struction urges them to avoid hostility.

"The first generation of their scholars turned their attention too much from the cultivation of the heart to the mere government of outward action; and in succeeding times the tolerant spirit, not natural to an establishment, was with difficulty kept up by a government whose ex¬ istence depended on discouraging intolerant pre¬ tensions. No sooner had the first sketch of the Hobbian phildsophy5 been privately circulated at Paris, than Cudworth seized the earliest oppor¬ tunity of sounding the alarm against the most justly odious of the modes of thinking which it cultivates, or forms of expression which it would introduce;4 the prelude to a war which occu¬ pied the remaining forty years of his life. The Intellectual System, his great production, is di¬ rected against the atheistical opinions of Hobbes: it touches ethical questions but occasionally and incidentally. It is a work of stupendous ei u- dition, of much more acuteness than at first appears, of frequent mastery over diction and illustration on subjects where it is most rare; and it is distinguished, perhaps beyond any other volume of controversy, by that best proof of the deepest conviction of the truth of a man s principles, a fearless statement of the most for¬ midable objections to them; a fairness rarely practised but by him who is conscious of his power to answer them. In all his writings, it must be owned, that his learning obscures his reasonings, and seems even to oppress his pow¬ erful intellect. It is an unfortunate effect of the redundant fulness of his mind, that it over¬ flows in endless digressions, which break the chain of argument, and turn aside the thoughts of the reader from the main object. He was edu¬ cated before usage had limited the naturaliza¬ tion of new words from the learned languages; before the failure of those great men, from Bacon to Milton, who laboured to follow a Latin order in their sentences,—and the success of those men of inferior powers, from Cowley to Addison, who were content with the order, as well as the words, of pure and elegant conversation,—had, as it were, by a double series of experiments, ascertained that the involutions and inversions of the ancient languages are seldom reconcil¬ able with the genius of ours; and, unless skil¬ fully, as well as sparingly introduced, are at variance with the natural beauties of our prose composition.

"The prospect or the sound which was disagree¬ able may become agreeable, without any altera¬ tion in our idea ot the objects. We can easily imagine a percipient and thinking being without a capacity of receiving pleasure or pain. Such a being might perceive what we do 5 if we could conceive him to reason, he might reason justly ; and if he were to judge at all, there seems no reason why he should not judge truly. But what could induce such a being to will or to act ? It seems evident that his existence could only be a state of passive contemplation. Reason, as reason, can never be a motive to action. It is only when we superadd to such a being sensi¬ bility, or the capacity of emotion or sentiment, (or what in corporeal cases is called sensation) of desire and aversion, that we introduce him into the world of action. We then clearly dis¬ cern, that when the conclusion of a process of reasoning presents to his mind an object of de¬ sire, or the means of obtaining it, a motive of action begins to operate; and reason may then, but not till then, have a powerful though indi¬ rect influence on conduct. Let any argument to dissuade a man from immorality be employ¬ ed, and the issue of it will always appear to be an appeal to a feeling. You prove that drunk¬ enness will probably ruin health. No position founded on experience is more certain. Most persons with whom you reason must he as much convinced of it as you are. But your hope of success depends on the drunkard’s fear of ill health; and he may always silence your argu¬ ment by telling you that he loves wine more than he dreads sickness. You speak in vain of the infamy of an act to one who disre¬ gards the opinion of others; or of its impru¬ dence to a man of little feeling for his own fu¬ ture condition. You may truly, but vainly, tell of the pleasures of friendship to one who has little affection. If you display the delights ot liberality to a miser, he may always shut your mouth by answering, “ The spendthrift may pre¬ fer such pleasures; I love money more.” If you even appeal to a man’s conscience, he may answer you, that you have clearly proved the im¬ morality of the act, and that he himself knew it before; but that now when you had renewed and freshened his conviction, he was obliged to own, that his love of virtue, even aided by the fear ot dishonour, remorse, and punishment, was not so powerful as the desire which hurried him into vice",Most,CZ,8,Czechia,Europe

"351 FENEI.ON"" As the last question, though strictly speak¬ ing theological, is yet in truth dependent on the more general question, which relates to the reality of disinterested affections in human na¬ ture, it seems not foreign from the present pur¬ pose to give a short account of a dispute on the subject in France, between two of the most emi¬ nent persons of their time ; namely, the contro¬ versy between Fenelon and JBossuet, concerning the possibility of men being influenced by the pure and disinterested love of God. Never were two great men more unlike. Fenelon in his writings exhibits more of the qualities which pre¬ dispose to religious feelings, than any other equally conspicuous person;—a mind so pure as steadily to contemplate supreme excellence; a heart capable of being touched and affected by the contemplation; a gentle and modest spirit, not elated by the privilege, but seeing its own want of worth as it came nearer to such bright¬ ness, and disposed to treat with compassionate forbearance those errors in others, of which it felt a humbling consciousness. Bossuet was ra¬ ther a great minister in the ecclesiastical com¬ monwealth; employing knowledge, eloquence, argument, the energy of his character, the in¬ fluence, and even the authority of his station, to vanquish opponents, to extirpate revolters, and, sometimes with a patrician firmness, to with¬ stand the dictatorial encroachment of the Roman Pontiff on the spiritual aristocracy of France",Roman,"FR,RO",8,"France,Romania","Europe,Europe"
"Fenelon had been appointed tutor to the Duke of Burgundy. He had all the qualities which fit a man to be the preceptor of a prince, and -BOSSUET.* which most disable him to get or to keep the office. Even birth, and urbanity, and accom¬ plishment, and vivacity, were an insufficient atonement for his genius and virtue. Louis XIV. distrusted so fine a spirit, and appears to have early suspected, that a fancy moved by such benevolence might imagine examples for his grandson which the world would consider as a satire on his own reign. Madame de Main- tenon, indeed, favoured him; but he was gene¬ rally believed to have forfeited her good graces by discouraging her projects for at least a near¬ er approach to a seat on the throne. He offend¬ ed her by obeying her commands, in laying be¬ fore her an account of her faults, and some of those of her royal husband, which was probably the more painfully felt for its mildness, justice, and refined observation.5 An opportunity for driving such an intruder from a court presented itself somewhat strangely, in the form of a subtile controversy on one of the most abstruse ques¬ tions of metaphysical theology. Molinos, a Spa¬ nish priest, reviving and perhaps exaggerating the maxims of the ancient Mystics, had recently taught, that Christian perfection consisted in the pure love of God, without hope of reward or fear of punishment. This offence he expiated by seven years’ imprisonment in the dungeons of the Roman Inquisition. His opinions were em¬ braced by Madame Guyon, a pious French lady of strong feeling and active imagination, who appears to have expressed them in a hyperboli¬ cal language, not infrequent in devotional exer¬ cises, especially in those of otherwise amiable nature than a place, and heaven canrfot be so well defined by anything without us, as by something within us.” (Select Discourses, 2d edit. Cambridge, 1673.) v In accordance with these old authorities is the recent language of a most ingenious as well as benevolent and pious wri- ter. “ ihe holiness of heaven is still more attractive to the Christian than its happiness. The desire of doing that which is right for its own sake is a part of his desire after heaven.” (Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel, by T.

"Louis XIV. regarded the slightest differences from the authorities of the French church as re¬ bellion against himself. Though endowed with much natural good sense, he was too grossly ignorant to be made to comprehend one of the terms of the question in dispute. He did not, however, scruple to urge the Pope to the con¬ demnation of Fenelon. Innocent XII. (Pigna- telli) an aged and pacific Pontiff, was desirous of avoiding such harsh measures. He said that “ the archbishop of Cambray might have erred from excess in the love of God, but the bishop of Meaux had sinned by a defect of the love of his neighbour.”1 But he was compelled to con¬ demn a series of propositions, of which the first was, “ there is an habitual state of love to God, which is pure from every motive of personal interest, and in which neither the fear of punish¬ ment nor the hope of reward has any part.”2 Fenelon read the bull which condemned him in his own cathedral, and professed as humble a submission as the lowest of his flock. In some of the writings of his advanced years, which have been recently published, we observe with regret that, when wearied out by his exile, ambitious to regain a place at court through the Jesuits, or prejudiced against the Calvinising doctrines of the Jansenists, the strongest anti-papal party among Catholics, or somewhat detached from a cause of which his great antagonist had been the victorious leader, he made concessions to the abso¬ lute monarchy of Rome, which did not become a luminary of the Galilean church.3 Bossuet, in his writings on this occasion, be¬ sides tradition and authorities, relied mainly on the supposed principle of philosophy, that man must desire his own happiness, and cannot de- 1 Bausset, Histoire de Fenelon, II. 220, note","Meaux, Rome","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"This defective and disorderly mode of publica¬ tion arose partly from the jars between business and study, inevitable in his course of life; but probably yet more from the nature of his system, which, while it widely deviates from the most general principles of former philosophers, is ready to embrace their particular doctrines under its own generalities, and thus to reconcile them to each other, as well as to accommodate itself to popular or established opinions, and compro¬ mise with them, according to his favourite and oft-repeated maxim, “ that most received doc¬ trines are capable of a good sense ;”3 by which last words our philosopher meant a sense reconcil¬ able with his own principles. Partial and oc¬ casional exhibitions of these principles suited better that constant negotiation with opinions, establishments, and prejudices, to which extreme generalities are well adapted, than a full and methodical statement of the whole at once. It is the lot of every philosopher who attempts to make his principles extremely flexible, that they become like those tools which bend so easily as to penetrate nothing. Yet his manner of publi¬ cation perhaps led him to those wide intuitions, as comprehensive as those of Bacon, of which he expressed the result as briefly and pithily as Hobbes. The fragment which contains his ethi¬ cal principles is the Preface to a collection of documents illustrative of international law, pub¬ lished at Hanover in 1693 ;4 to which he often referred as his standard afterwards, especially when he speaks of Lord Shaftesbury, or of the controversy between the two great theologi¬ ans of France. “ Right,” says he, “ is moral power; obligation moral necessity. By moral, I understand what with a good man prevails as much as if it were physical. A good man is he who loves all men as far as reason allows.

"Reason perceives the moral superiority of one being over another, as immediately as the equal¬ ity of the radii of the same circle. The rela¬ tive perfection of beings is that part of the im¬ movable order to which men must conform their minds and their conduct. The love of order is the whole of virtue, and conformity to order constitutes the morality of actions.” It is not difficult to discover, that in spite of the singular skill employed in weaving this web, it answers no other purpose than that of hiding the whole difficulty. The love of universal or¬ der, says Malehranche, requires that we should value an animal more than a stone, because it is more valuable ; and love God infinitely more than man, because he is infinitely better.

"He was the father of speculative philosophy in Scotland, at least in modern times; for though in the beginning of the sixteenth century the Scotch are said to have been known through¬ out Europe by their unmeasured passion for dialectical subtilties,1 and though this metaphy¬ sical taste was nourished by the controversies which followed the Reformation, yet it languish¬ ed, with every other intellectual taste and talent, from the Restoration, first silenced by civil dis orders, and afterwards repressed by an exem¬ plary but unlettered clergy, till the philosophy of Shaftesbury was brought by Hutcheson from Ireland. We are told by the writer of his Life, (a fine piece of philosophical biography) that “ he had a remarkable degree of rational enthusiasm for learning, liberty, religion, virtue, and human happiness2 that he taught in public with per¬ suasive eloquence; that his instructive conversa¬ tion was at once lively and modest; that he unit¬ ed pure manners with a kind disposition. What wonder that such a man should have spread the love of knowledge and virtue around him, and should have rekindled in his adopted country a relish for the sciences which he cultivated ! To him may also be ascribed that proneness to mul¬ tiply ultimate and original principles in human nature, which characterized the Scottish School till the second extinction of a passion for meta¬ physical speculation in Scotland. A careful perusal of the writings of this now little studied philosopher will satisfy the well-qualified reader, that Dr Adam Smith’s ethical speculations are not so unsuggested as they are beautiful",,IE,8,Ireland,Europe

The patriotism of Berkeley was not, like that of Swift, tainted by disappointed ambition; nor was it, like Swift’s, confined to a colony of English Pro¬ testants. Perhaps the Querist contains more hints, then original, still unapplied in legislation and political economy, than are to be found in any equal space. From the writings of his advanced years, when he chose a medical Tract1 * 3 to be the vehicle of his philosophical reflections, though it cannot be said that he relinquished his early opinions, it is at least apparent that his mind had received a new bent, and was habitually turned from reasoning towards con¬ templation. His immaterialism indeed modest¬ ly appears, but only to purify and elevate our thoughts, and to fix them on Mind, the para¬ mount and primeval principle of all things",Berkeley,"US,IE",8,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"
"“ Perhaps,” says he, “ the truth about innate ideas may be, that there are properly no ideas or passive objects in the mind but what are de¬ rived from sense, but that there are also, be¬ sides these, her own acts and operations—such are notionsa statement which seems once more to admit general conceptions, and which might have served, as well as the parallel pass¬ age of Leibnitz, as the basis of the modern phi¬ losophy of Germany. From these compositions of his old age, he appears then to have recurred with fondness to Plato and the later Platonists; writers from whose mere reasonings an intellect so acute could hardly hope for an argumentative satisfaction of all its difficulties, and whom he probably rather studied as a means of inuring his mind to objects beyond the visible diurnal sphere, and of attaching it, through frequent meditation, to that perfect and transcendent goodness to which his moral feelings always pointed, and which they incessantly strove to grasp. His mind, enlarging as it rose, at length receives every theist, however imperfect his be¬ lief, to a communion in its philosophic piety",Plato,"DE,CO",8,"Germany,Colombia","Europe,South America"
"His general principles of Ethics may be shortly stated in his own words :—“ As God is a being of infinite goodness, his end is the good of his creatures. The general wellbeing of all men of all nations, of all ages of the world, is that which he designs should be procured by the concur¬ ring actions of each individual.” Having stated that this end can be pursued only in one of two ways—either by computing the consequences of each action, or by obeying rules which generally tend to happiness—and having shown the first to be impossible, he rightly infers, “ that the end to which God requires the concurrence of human actions, must be carried on by the ob¬ servation of certain determinate and universal rules or moral precepts, which in their own na¬ ture have a necessary tendency to promote the wellbeing of mankind, taking in all nations and ages, from the beginning to the end of the world.”8 A romance, of which a journey to an Utopia, in the centre of Africa, forms the chief part, called The Adventures of Signor Gau- dentio di Lucca, has been commonly ascribed to him; probably on no other ground than its union of pleasing invention with benevolence and ele¬ gance.5 Of the exquisite grace and beauty of his diction, no man accustomed to English com¬ position can need to be informed. His works are, beyond dispute, the finest models of phi¬ losophical style since Cicero. Perhaps they surpass those of the orator, in the wonderful art by which the fullest light is thrown on the most minute and evanescent parts of the most subtile of human conceptions. Perhaps he also surpassed Cicero in the charm of sim¬ plicity, a quality eminently found in Irish wri¬ ters before the end of the eighteenth century; conspicuous in the masculine severity of Swift, 1 Siris, or Reflections on Tar Water","Lucca, Of, Cicero, Cicero","US,IT,TR,UK,IE",8,"United States,Italy,Turkey,N/A,Ireland","North America,Europe,Asia,N/A,Europe"

The two Irish philosophers of the eighteenth century may be said to have co-operated in calling forth the metaphysical genius of Scotland; for, though Hutcheson spread the taste, and furnished the principles, yet Berkeley undoubtedly produced the scep¬ ticism of Hume, which stimulated the instinc¬ tive school to activity, and was thought incap¬ able of confutation, otherwise than by their doctrines","Berkeley, Berkeley","US,IE",8,"United States,Ireland","North America,Europe"

"In his twenty-seventh year he published at London the Treatise of Human Nature, the first systematic attack on all the principles of know¬ ledge and belief, and the most formidable, if universal scepticism could ever be more than a mere exercise of ingenuity.1 This memorable work was reviewed in a Journal of that time,2 in a criticism not distinguished by ability, which affects to represent the style of a very clear writer as unintelligible—sometimes from a pur¬ pose to insult, but oftener from sheer dulness— which is unaccountably silent respecting the consequences of a sceptical system; and which concludes with a prophecy so much at variance with the general tone of the article, that it would seem to be added by a different hand",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

If he must be supposed to have had an eye on any French writer, it would be a more plausible guess, that he sometimes copied, with a tem¬ perate hand, the unexpected thoughts and famil¬ iar expressions of Fontenelle. Though he care¬ fully weeded his writings in their successive editions, yet they still contain Scotticisms and Gallicisms enough to employ the successors of such critics as those who exulted over the Pata- vinity of the Roman Historian. His own great and modest mind would have been satisfied with the praise which cannot be withheld from him, that there is no writer in our language who, through long works, is more agreeable; and it is no derogation from him, that, as a Scots¬ man, he did not reach those native and secret beauties, characteristical of a language, which are never attained, in elaborate composition, but by a very small number of those who famil¬ iarly converse in it from infancy",,FR,8,France,Europe
"well shown the connection of domestic ties with the outward order of society, should not have perceived their deeper and closer relation to all the social feelings of human nature. It cannot he enough regretted, that, in an Enquiry wiit- ten with a very moral purpose, his habit of ma¬ king truth attractive, by throwing over her the dress of paradox, should have given him for a moment the appearance of weighing the mere amusements of society and conversation against domestic fidelity, which is the preserver of do¬ mestic affection, the source of parental fondness and filial regard, and, indirectly, of all the kind¬ ness which exists between human beings. That families are schools where the infant heart learns to love, and that pure manners are the ce¬ ment which alone holds these schools together, are truths so certain, that it is wonderful he should not have betrayed a stronger sense of their importance. No one could so well have proved that all the virtues of that class, in their various orders and degrees, minister to the be¬ nevolent affections; and that every act which separates the senses from the affections tends, in some degree, to deprive kindness of its natural auxiliary, and to lessen its prevalence in the world. It did not require his sagacity to discover that the gentlest and tenderest feelings flourish only under the stern guardianship of these severe virtues. Perhaps his philosophy was loosened, though his life was untainted, by that universal and undistinguishing profligacy which prevailed on the Continent, from the regency of the Duke of Orleans to the French revolution; the most dissolute period of European history, at least since the Roman emperors.1 At Rome, indeed, the connection of licentiousness with cruelty, which, though scarcely traceable in individuals, is generally very observable in large masses, bore a fearful testimony to the value of austere purity.

"This tremendous convulsion threw a fearful light on the ferocity which lies hid under the arts and pleasures of corrupted nations; as earthquakes and volcanoes disclose the layers which compose the deeper parts of our planet, beneath a fertile and flowery surface. A part of this dreadful re¬ sult may be ascribed, not improbably, to that relaxation of domestic ties, unhappily natural to the populace of vast capitals, and at that time countenanced and aggravated by the example of their superiors. Another part doubtless arose from the barbarizing power of absolute govern¬ ment, or, in other words, of injustice in high places. A very large portion attests, as strongly as Roman history, though in a somewhat differ¬ ent manner, the humanizing efficacy of the family virtues, by the consequences of the want of them in the higher classes, whose profuse and ostenta¬ tious sensuality inspired the laborious and suffer¬ ing portion of mankind with contempt, disgust, envy, and hatred",Roman,RO,8,Romania,Europe
"That mankind are so constituted as to sympa¬ thize with each other’s feelings, and to feel pleasure in the accordance of these feelings, are the only facts required by Hr Smith, and they certainly must be granted to him. To adopt the feelings of another, is to approve them. When the sentiments of another are such as would be excited in us by the same objects, we approve them as morally proper. To obtain this accord, it becomes necessary for him who enjoys or suf¬ fers, to lower his expression of feeling to the point to which the by-stander can raise his fel¬ low-feelings ; on which are founded all the higli virtues of self-denial and self-command; and it is equally necessary for the by-stander to raise his sympathy as near as he can to the level of the original feeling.

"379 Hartley and Condillac,1 who, much about the same time, hut seemingly without any know¬ ledge of each other’s speculations,2 * began in a very similar mode to simplify, hut also to muti¬ late the system of Locke, stopped short of what is called Materialism, which consummates the confusion, hut touched its threshold. Thither, it must be owned, their philosophy pointed, and thither their followers proceeded. Hartley and Bonnet,5 still more than Condillac, suffered them¬ selves, like most of their contemporaries, to overlook the important truth, that all the changes in the organs which can he likened to other material phenomena, are nothing more than an¬ tecedents and prerequisites of perception, hearing not the faintest likeness to it; as much outward in relation to the thinking principle, as if they occurred in any other part of matter; and of which the entire comprehension, if it were at¬ tained, would not bring us a step nearer to the nature of thought. They who would have been the first to exclaim against the mistake of a sound for a colour, fell into the more unspeak¬ able error of confounding the perception of ob¬ jects, as outward, with the consciousness of our own mental operations. Locke’s doctrine, that Reflection was a separate source of ideas, left room for this greatest of all distinctions,— though with much unhappiness of expression, and with no little variance from the course of his own speculations. Hartley, Condillac, and Bonnet, in hewing away this seeming deformity from the system of their master, unwittingly struck off the part of the building which, how¬ ever unsightly, gave it the power of yielding some shelter and guard to truths, of which the exclusion rendered it utterly untenable. They became consistent Nominalists; a controversy on which Locke expresses himself with confu¬ sion and contradiction; but on this subject they added nothing to what had been taught by Hobbes and Berkeley. Both Hartley and Con¬ dillac4 have the merit of having been unseduced by the temptations either of scepticism or of useless idealism; which, even if Berkeley and Hume could have been unknown to them, must have been within sight. Both agree in referring all the intellectual operations to the association of ideas, and in representing that association as reducible to the single law, that ideas which en¬ ter the mind at the same time, acquire a ten¬ dency to call up each other, which is in direct proportion to the frequency of their having en¬ tered together. In this important part of their doctrine they seem, whether unconsciously or otherwise, to have only repeated, and very much expanded, the opinion of Hobbes.5 In its sim¬ plicity it is more agreeable than the system of Mr Hume, who admitted five independent laws of association; and it is in comprehension far superior to the views of the same subject by Mr Locke, whose ill-chosen name still retains its place in our nomenclature, but who only appeals to the principle as explaining some fancies and whimsies of the human mind. The capital fault of Hartley is that of a rash generalization, which may prove imperfect, and which is at least pre¬ mature. All attempts to explain instinct by this principle have hitherto been unavailing. Many of the most important processes of reasoning have not hitherto been accounted for by it.6 It would appear by a close examination, that even this theory, simple as it appears, presupposes many facts relating to the mind, of which its authors 1 Born in 1715 ; died in 1780","Berkeley, Berkeley, Born","US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"

"5 It has not been mentioned in its proper place, that Hutcheson appears nowhere to greater advantage than in Letters on the Fable of the Bees, published when he was very young, at Dublin, in a publication called Hibernicus. “ Private vices public benefits,” says he, “ may signify any one of these five distinct propositions : 1. They are in themselves public be¬ nefits ; or, 2. They naturally produce public happiness ; or, 3. They may be made to produce it; or, 4, They may natu¬ rally flow from it; or, 5. At least they may probably flow from it in our infirm nature.” (See a small volume containing Thoughts on Laughter, and Observations on the Fable of the Bees, Glasgow, 1758, in which these letters are republished.)

"This precious mine may therefore he truly said to have been opened by Hartley; for he who did such superabundant justice to the hints of Gay, would assuredly not have withheld the like tribute from Hutcheson, had he observ¬ ed the happy expression of “ secondary pas¬ sions,” which ought to have led that philoso¬ pher himself farther than he ventured to ad¬ vance. The extraordinary value of this part of Hartley’s system has been hidden by various causes, which have also enabled writers who borrow from it to decry it. The influence of his medical habits renders many of his examples displeasing, and sometimes disgusting. He has none of that knowledge of the world, of that fa¬ miliarity with literature, of that delicate percep¬ tion of the beauties of nature and art, which not only supply the most agreeable illustrations of mental philosophy, but afford the most obvious and striking instances of its happy application to subjects generally interesting. His particular applications of the general law are often mis¬ taken, and seldom more than brief notes and hasty suggestions; the germs of theories which, while some might adopt them without detec¬ tion, others might discover without being aware that they were anticipated. To which it may he added, that in spite of the imposing forms of geometry, the work is not really distinguished by good method, or even uniform adherence to that which had been chosen. His style is en¬ titled to no praise but that of clearness, and a simplicity of diction, through which is visible a singular simplicity of mind. No book perhaps exists which, with so few of the common allure¬ ments, comes at last so much to please by the picture it presents of the writer’s character,—a character which kept him pure from the pursuit, often from the consciousness of novelty, and ren¬ dered him a discoverer in spite of his own modes¬ ty. In those singular passages in which, amidst the profound internal tranquillity of all the Euro¬ pean nations, he foretells approaching convul¬ sions, to he followed by the overthrow of states and churches, his quiet and gentle spirit, else¬ where almost ready to inculcate passive obe¬ dience for the sake of peace, is supported under its awful forebodings by the hope of that general progress in virtue and happiness which he saw through the preparatory confusion. A meek piety, inclining towards mysticism, and sometimes in¬ dulging in visions which borrow a lustre from his fervid benevolence, was beautifully, and perhaps singularly, blended in him with zeal for the most unbounded freedom of inquiry, flowing both from his own conscientious belief and his un¬ mingled love of truth.

The rectitude of judgment purity of heart, elevation of ho¬ nour, the sternness only in integrity, the scorn of baseness, and indulgence towards weakness, which were joined m him with a gravity exclusive neither of feeling nor of pleasantry, contributed still more than his abilities and attainments of va- rious sorts, to a moral authority with his friends, and in his profession, which few men more amply possesse , or more use- fully exercised.

"Dugatd Stewart was the son of Dr Matthew Stewart, Professor of Mathematics in the Uni¬ versity of Edinburgh; a station immediately before filled by Maclaurin, on the recommenda¬ tion of Newton. Hence the poet spoke of “ the philosophic sire and son.”8 He was educated at Edinburgh, and he heard the lectures of Reid at Glasgow.

As he wrote in a general lan¬ guage, he propagated its doctrines throughout Europe, where they were beneficial to jurispru¬ dence, hut perhaps injurious to the cause of re¬ formation in government.

Dumont; partly to that tendency towards free specula¬ tion and bold reform which was more prevalent among nations newly freed, or impatiently aspir¬ ing to freedom, than in a people long satisfied with the possession of a system of government like that which others were struggling to ob¬ tain, and not yet aware of the imperfections and abuses in their laws, to the amendment of which a cautious consideration of Mr Bentham’s works will undoubtedly most materially con¬ tribute","Edinburgh, Newton, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ferguson, Dumont","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

"Long after the death of Dr Reid, his philoso¬ phy was taught at Paris by M. Royer Collard,1 who, on the restoration of free debate, became the most philosophical orator of his nation, and now fills, with impartiality and dignity, the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. His inge¬ nious and eloquent scholar, Professor Cousin, dissatisfied with what he calls <c the sage and timid” doctrines of Edinburgh, which he con¬ sidered as only a vigorous protest, on behalf of common sense, against the scepticism of Hume, sought in Germany for a philosophy of “ such a masculine and brilliant character as might command the attention of Europe, and be able to struggle with success on a great theatre, against the genius of the adverse school.”* It may be questioned whether he found in Kant more than the same vigorous protest, under a more systematic form, with an immense nomen¬ clature, and constituting a philosophical edifice of equal symmetry and vastness. The prefer¬ ence of the more boastful system, over a philo¬ sophy thus chiefly blamed for its modest preten¬ sions, does not seem to be entirely justified by its permanent authority in the country which gave it birth; where, however powerful its in¬ fluence still continues to be, its doctrines do not appear to have now many supporters : and, in¬ deed, the accomplished Professor himself rapid¬ ly shot through Kantianism, and now appears to rest or to stop at the doctrines of Schelling and Hegel, at a point so high, that it is hard to descry from it any distinction between objects, —even that indispensable distinction between Reality and Illusion.

"Royer Collard and M.

The success of these attempts to ren¬ der Speculative Philosophy once more popular in the country of Descartes, has already been considerable.

"These agreeable prospects bring us easily back to our subject; for though the restoration of Speculative Philosophy in the country of Des¬ cartes is due to the precise statement and vi¬ gorous logic of M.

"Dr Brown was born in one of those families of ministers in the Scottish church who, after a 1 Born in 1778 ; died in 1820",Born,NL,8,Netherlands,Europe
"411 generation or two of a humble life spent in piety and usefulness, with no more than needful knowledge, have more than once sent forth a man of genius from their cool and quiet shade, to make his fellows wiser or better by tongue or pen, by head or hand. Even the scanty endow¬ ments and constant residence of that church, by keeping her ministers far from the objects which awaken turbulent passions and disperse the un¬ derstanding on many pursuits, afforded some of the leisure and calm of monastic life, without the exclusion of the charities of family and kin¬ dred. It may be well doubted whether this un¬ dissipated retirement, which during the eigh¬ teenth century was very general in Scotland, did not make full amends for the loss of curious and ornamental knowledge, by its tendency to quali¬ fy men for professional duty, by the cultivation of reason among a considerable number, and by those opportunities for high meditation, and for the unchangeable concentration of mind on wor¬ thy objects, to the few who had the natural capa¬ city for such exertions.1 An authentic account of the early exercises of Brown’s mind is preserved by his biographer.2 At the age of nineteen he took a part with others, some of whom became the most memorable men of their time, in the foundation of a private so¬ ciety in Edinburgh, under the name of “ the Academy of Physics.”3 The character of Dr Brown is very attractive, as an example of one in whom the utmost ten¬ derness of affection, and the indulgence of a flowery fancy, were not repressed by the high¬ est cultivation, and by a perhaps excessive re¬ finement of intellect. His mind soared and roamed through every region of philosophy and poetry; but his untravelled heart clung to the hearth of his father, to the children who shared it with him, and after them, first to the other part¬ ners of his childish sports, and then almost solely to those companions of his youthful studies who continued to be the friends of his life. Specula¬ tion seemed to keep his kindness at home. It is observable, that though sparkling with fancy, he does not seem to have been deeply or durably touched by those affections which are lighted at its torch, or at least tinged with its colours. His heart sought little abroad, but contentedly dwelt in his family and in his study. He was one of those men of genius who repaid the tender care of a mother by rocking the cradle of her repos¬ ing age. He ended a life spent in searching foi truth, and exercising love, by desiring that he should be buried in his native parish, with his <£ dear father and mother.” Some of these delightful qualities were perhaps hidden from the casual observer in general society, by the want of that perfect simplicity of manner which is doubtless their natural representative. Man¬ ner is a better mark of the state of a mind, than those large and deliberate actions which form what is called conduct. It is the constant and insensible transpiration of character. In serious acts a man may display himself. In the thou¬ sand nameless acts which compose manner, the mind betrays its habitual bent. But manner is then only an index of disposition, when it is that of men who live at ease in the intimate famili¬ arity of friends and equals. It may be diverted from simplicity by causes which do not reach so deep as the character; by bad models, or by a restless and wearisome anxiety to shine, arising from many circumstances, none of which are pro¬ bably more common than the unseasonable ex¬ ertions of a recluse student in society, and the 1 See Sib H.

"There are two very different sorts of passages of poetry to be found in works on philosophy, which are as far asunder from each other in value as in matter. A philosopher will admit some of those wonderful lines or words which bring to light the infinite varieties of character, the furious bursts or wily workings of passion, the winding approaches of temptation, the slip¬ pery path to depravity, the beauty of tender¬ ness, the grandeur of what is awful and holy in man. In every such quotation, the moral phi¬ losopher, if he be successful, uses the best mate¬ rials of his science; for what are they hut the results of experiment and observation on the hu¬ man heart, performed by artists of far other skill and power than his ? They are facts which could have only been ascertained by Homer, by Dante, by Shakspeare, by Cervantes, by Milton. Every year of admiration since the unknown period when the Iliad first gave delight, has extorted new proofs of the justness of the picture of hu¬ man nature, from the responding hearts of the admirers. Every strong feeling which these masters have excited is a successful repetition of their original experiment, and a continually growing evidence of the greatness of their dis¬ coveries. Quotations of this nature may he the most satisfactory, as well as the most delightful, proofs of philosophical positions.

"Much more need not he said of Dr Brown’s own poetry, somewhat voluminous as it is, than that it indicates fancy and feeling, and rose at least to the rank of an elegant accomplish¬ ment. It may seem a paradox, hut it appears to me that he is really most poetical in those poems and passages which have the most pro¬ perly metaphysical character. For every various form of life and nature, when it is habitually contemplated, may inspire feeling; and the just representation of these feelings may he poe¬ tical. Dr Brown observed man, and his wider world, with the eye of a metaphysician; and the dark results of such contemplations, when he reviewed them, often filled his soul with feelings which, being both grand and melan¬ choly, were truly poetical. Unfortunately, how¬ ever, few readers can he touched with fellow- feeling. He sings to few, and must be content with sometimes moving a string in the soul of the lonely visionary, who, in the day-dreams of youth, has felt as well as meditated on the mys¬ teries of nature. His heart has produced charm¬ ing passages in all his poems; hut, generally speaking, they are only beautiful works of art and imitation. The choice of Akenside as a fa¬ vourite and a model may, without derogation from that writer, he considered as no proof of a poetically formed mind.1 There is more poetry in many single lines of Cowper than in volumes of sonorous verses such as Akenside’s. Philoso¬ phical poetry is very different from versified philosophy. The former is the highest exertion of genius, the latter cannot he ranked above the slighter amusements of ingenuity. Dr Brown’s poetry was, it must he owned, composed either of imitations, which, with some exceptions, may he produced and read without feeling, or of effu sions of such feelings only as meet a rare and faint echo in the human breast",Much,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"A few words only can here be bestowed on the intellectual part of his philosophy. It is an open revolt against the authority of Reid; and, by a curious concurrence, he began to lecture nearly at the moment when the doctrines of that phi¬ losopher came to be taught with applause in France. Mr Stewart had dissented from the language of Reid, and had widely departed from his opinions on several secondary theories. Dr Brown rejected them entirely. He very justly considered the claim of Reid to the merit of de¬ tecting the universal delusion which had be¬ trayed philosophers into the belief that ideas which were the sole objects of knowledge had a separate existence, as a proof of his having mis¬ taken their illustrative language for a metaphy¬ sical opinion ;2 hut he does not do justice to the service which Reid really rendered to mental science, by keeping the attention of all future speculators in a state of more constant watchful¬ ness against the transient influence of such an illusion. His choice of the term feeling* to de¬ note the operations which we usually refer to the understanding, is evidently too wide a do parture from its ordinary use, to have any pro¬ bability of general adoption.

These voluntary occupations deserve our attention still less as examples of prodigious power than as proofs of an intimate con¬ viction, which hinds them by unity of purpose with his public duties, that (to use the almost dying words of an excellent person) “ man can neither be happy without virtue, nor actively virtuous without liberty, nor securely free without rational knowledge.” (Close of Sir W.

"427 piety to contemplate as the last and highest stage of virtue and happiness, a sort of self- annihilation, which, however unsuitable to the present condition of mankind, yet places in the strongest light the disinterested character of the system, of which it is a conceivable though perhaps not attainable result. The complete¬ ness and rigour acquired by conscience, when all its dictates are revered as the commands of a perfectly wise and good Being, are so obvious, that they cannot he questioned by any reason¬ able man, however extensive his incredulity may be. It is thus that conscience can add the warmth of an affection to the inflexibility of principle and habit. It is true that, in exa¬ mining the evidence of the divine original of a religious system, in estimating an imperfect re¬ ligion, or in comparing the demerits of religions of human origin, conscience must he the stand¬ ard chiefly applied. But it follows with equal clearness, that those who have the happiness to find satisfaction and repose in divine revela¬ tion, are bound to consider all those precepts for the government of the will, delivered by it, which are manifestly universal, as the rules to which all their feelings and actions should conform. The true distinction between con¬ science and a taste for moral beauty has already been pointed out;1 a distinction which, not¬ withstanding its simplicity, has been unobserved by philosophers, perhaps on account of the fre¬ quent co-o-peration and intermixture of the two feelings. Most speculators have either denied the existence of the taste, or kept it out of view in their theory, or exalted it to the place which is rightfully filled only by conscience. Yet it is perfectly obvious that, like all the other feel¬ ings called pleasures of imagination, it termi¬ nates in delightful contemplation, while the moral faculty always aims exclusively at volun¬ tary action. Nothing can more clearly show that this last quality is the characteristic of con¬ science, than its being thus found to distinguish that faculty from the sentiments which most nearly resemble it, most frequently attend it, and are most easily blended with it",Most,CZ,8,Czechia,Europe
"With him the love of speculative philosophy, as a pursuit, appears to have expired in Scot¬ land. There are some symptoms, yet how¬ ever very faint, of the revival of a taste for it among the English youth. It was received with approbation in France from M. Royer Collard, the scholar of Stewart more than of Reid, and 1 See supra, p. 384, 385",,"FR,UK",8,"France,N/A","Europe,N/A"

"But the Epicureans were by no means right, even on the latter question; and they were total¬ ly wrong on the other and far more momentous part of the subject. Their error is more exten¬ sive, and infinitely more injurious. But what should now hinder an inquirer after truth from embracing but amending their doctrine where it is partially true, and adopting without any change the just description of the most important prin¬ ciples of human nature which we owe to their more enlightened as well as more generous an¬ tagonists ? Though unwilling to abandon the arguments by which, from the earliest times, the existence of the supreme and eternal mind has been esta¬ blished, avc, as well as the German philosophers, are entitled to call in the help of our moral na¬ ture to lighten the burden of those tremendous difficulties which cloud his moral government",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"431 the reality or extent of the clanger, hut on a state of mind which renders it more or less ac¬ cessible to fear. Though it must be owned that the moral sentiments are very different from any other human faculty, yet the above observations seem to be in a great measure applicable to every state of mind. The emotions and desires which compose conscience, while they occupy the mind, must exclude all contemplation of the cause in which the object of these feelings may have ori¬ ginated. To their eye the voluntary dispositions and actions, their sole object, must appear to be the first link of a chain. In the view of con¬ science they have no foreign original. The con¬ science being so constantly associated with all volitions, its view becomes habitual:—being al¬ ways possessed of some, and capable of intense warmth, it predominates over the habits of thinking of those few who are employed in the analyses of mental occupations. The reader who has in any degree been inclined to adopt the explanations attempted above, of the im¬ perative character of conscience, may be dis¬ posed also to believe that they afford some foun¬ dation for that conviction of the existence of a power to obey its commands, which (it ought to be granted to the German philosophers) is irresistibly suggested by the commanding tone of all its dictates. If such an explanation should be thought worthy of consideration, it must be very carefully distinguished from that illusive sense by which some writers have laboured to reconcile the feeling of liberty with the reality of necessity.1 In this case there is no illusion; —nothing is required but the admission, that every faculty observes its own laws, and that when the action of the one fills the mind, that of every other is suspended. The ear cannot see, nor can the eye hear. Why then should not the greater powers of reason and conscience have different habitual modes of contemplating voluntary actions ? How strongly do experience and analogy seem to require the arrangement of motive and volition under the class of causes and effects ! With what irresistible power, on the other hand, do all our moral sentiments re¬ move extrinsic agency from view, and concen¬ trate all feeling in the agent himself! The one manner of thinking may predominate among the speculative few in their short moments of abstraction; the other will be that of all other men, and of the speculator himself when he is called upon to act, or when his feelings are powerfully excited by the amiable or odious dispositions of his fellow-men. In these work¬ ings of various faculties there is nothing that can be accurately described as contrariety of opinion. An intellectual state, and a feeling, never can be contrary to each other. They are too utterly incapable of comparison to be the subject of contrast. They are agents of a perfectly different nature, acting in different spheres. A feeling can no more be called true or false, than a demonstration, considered simply in itself, can be said to be agreeable or disagreeable. It is true, indeed, that in conse¬ quence of the association of all mental acts with each other, emotions and desires may occasion habitual errors of judgment;—but liability to error belongs to every exercise of human reason; it arises from a multitude of causes; it con¬ stitutes, therefore, no difficulty peculiar to the case before us. Neither truth nor falsehood can be predicated of the perceptions of the senses, but they lead to false opinions. An object seen through different mediums may by the inex¬ perienced be thought to be no longer the same",,DE,8,Germany,Europe

Here, says the French editor, it may be doubt¬ ed whether Aquinas means the Pope’s temporal power in his own dominions, or a secular autho¬ rity indirectly extending over all for the sake of religion. My reasons for adopting the more ra¬ tional construction are shortly these:—1.

His former reasoning on the same question seems to be de¬ cisive. The power of the Pope over bishops, he says, is not founded merely in his supe¬ rior nature, but in their authority being alto¬ gether derived from his, as the proconsular power from the imperial. Therefore he infers that this case is not analogous to the relation between the civil and spiritual power, which are alike derived from God. 4.

"44 We know,” says he, 44 no universal proposi¬ tion respecting human nature which is true but one—that men always act from self-interest.” (Edinburgh Review, March 1829.) It is mani¬ fest from the sequel, that the writer is not the dupe of the confusion ; but many of his readers may be so. If, indeed, the word self-interest could with propriety be used for the gratification of every prevalent desire, he has clearly shown that this change in the signification of terms would be of no advantage to the doctrine which he controverts. It would make as many sorts of self-interest as there are appetites, and it is irreconcilably at variance with the system of as¬ sociation embraced by Mr Mill. To the word self-love Hartley properly assigns two signifi¬ cations: 1. Gross self-love, which consists in the pursuit of the greatest pleasures, from all those desires which look to individual gratifica¬ tion; or, 2. refined self-love, which seeks the greatest pleasure which can arise from all the desires of human nature,—the latter of which is an invaluable, though inferior principle.

"Respecting the details of the rise and preva¬ lence of the doctrine of a future state among the great majority of the Jews, the scantiness of his¬ torical authority leaves us chiefly to our own con¬ jectures. Without entering at large into a dis¬ quisition which must, after all, be obscured by much uncertainty, it may be allowable to suggest, that the Jews were likely to be much influenced by the probable arguments which their own rea¬ son partly supplied, and which they partly learn¬ ed from the neighbouring nations, with whom (and with some of the more intelligent and en¬ lightened of them) they had much more, and much more extensive, intercourse after the captivity than before. Nor does such a supposition mili¬ tate, as might at first sight be suspected, against what has been elsewhere advanced respecting the prevailing disbelief, among the heathen, of the popular fables of Elysium and Tartarus, and re¬ specting the emptiness of the pretended immor¬ tality of the soul, held by philosophers. For what¬ ever their belief might be, they would be likely, in any discussion with their Jewish neighbours, to set forth either such arguments as occurred to them in favour of a future retribution, which un¬ doubtedly was a part of the religion they pro¬ fessed, or such pretended proofs of the natural and necessary immortality of the soul, as their schools supplied. And such discussions we can¬ not but suppose must have been frequent; since the intercourse of the dispersed Jews with the Gentiles was such as to lead to the disuse of their own language, and the consequent necessity of a translation of their Scriptures into Greek. Now the Jews, who claimed to be favoured with an authentic revelation of God’s will, and to be his peculiar People, could not have been satisfied to rest their pretensions to such superiority, and their boast of its advantages, on the extraordi¬ nary providence under which their ancestors had lived, but which seems to have been nearly, if not entirely, withdrawn from themselves ; but would be likely to set up a rival claim to that of the Pagan religions, and to produce from their Scrip¬ tures every thing that might seem to favour the hope of a future reward.

"peated assurances and admonitions should be em¬ ployed, even towards those who have received the doctrine on the most satisfactory authority. A Christian minister, accordingly, in these days, finds that his hearers require to be perpetually reminded of this truth, to which they have long since given their assent; and that even, with all the pains he takes to inculcate it, in every differ¬ ent mode, he is still but very partially successful in drawing off men’s attention from the things of this world, and fixing it on the “ unseen things that are eternal.” Much more must this have been the case with the Israelites whom Moses was addressing, who were so dull and gross-minded, so childishly shortsighted and sensual, that even the immediate miraculous presence of God among them, of whose judgments and deliverances they had been eye-witnesses, was insufficient to keep them steady in their allegiance to Him. Even the temporal sanctions of the Law,—the plenty and famine—the victory and defeat, and all the other points of that alternative of worldly pros¬ perity and adversity which was set before them —things in their nature so much more easily com¬ prehended by an unthinking and barbarous peo¬ ple, and so much more suited to their tastes—it was found necessary to detail with the utmost minuteness, and to repeat and remind them of in the most impressive manner, in a vast number of different passages.

He would, doubtless, have taught the Israelites to look for a state of future retribution also; which was done by the ancient heathen law¬ givers.

They are chiefly such as are calculated, and apparently designed, to repress superstitious veneration. One of them records that, when the mother and other kindred of our Lord were an¬ nounced as desiring to speak with Him, He took occasion to point out that these had no claim, on that ground, to especial reverence ; He turned to his disciples, and said, “ Behold my mother and my brethren!” Upon another occasion, when a woman exclaimed—“ Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps that Thou has sucked” —He replied, “ Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.” One of those who did so, was, we may be sure, his mo¬ ther herself; but the mere circumstance of her being his mother, did not, as He declares, imply a blessedness equal to that of the humblest of his faithful hearers. Does not the record of these allusions to one of whom so little is recorded, seem expressly designed to guard against that superstitious error to which the tendency is so natural, and, as experience has shewn, so strong? Once more, it is mentioned in the narrative contained in the second chapter of St John’s Gospel, that the mother of Jesus was invited, as well as himself, and his disciples, to the marriage- feast at Cana. She seems to have been apprised of his design to perform the miracle ; for she ap¬ plied to him when the wine was deficient. His answer has not that roughness, indeed, which our English translation gives it, from the use of the term “ woman.” The word in the original is one which denotes no disrespect; being found in the classical Greek writers applied even to a queen. But He plainly forbids her interference, telling her that the time is not yet come for the display of his miraculous power. Now, why is her application to him, and his reply,—why is even her presence on this occasion at all,—men¬ tioned in this place ? Evidently, for the purpose of shewing that he would do no miracle at her bidding ; that his filial reverence did not extend to his admitting her interference in anything connected with his ministry. It is a warning to all who will be warned by Scripture, that they must not be led by their veneration for the mother of Jesus, to look for her intercession for them with her Son. “ There is one mediator 1 Once very slightly, in Acts i",,"UK,GR",8,"N/A,Greece","N/A,Europe"

"For example—one great abuse, and that the parent of many others, the keeping of the Scrip¬ tures and of the public Service in a dead lan¬ guage, was doubtless much favoured by the great extent of a single Church. The abuse was not one that originated in very early times. For it was not caused by men’s having from the first a superstitious dread of any attempt to trans¬ late the Scriptures at all, and consequently leav¬ ing them in the original Hebrew and Greek. On the contrary, they were translated into Latin, when that was the prevailing language, on pur¬ pose that they might be accessible to the people",,GR,8,Greece,Europe

"And this is proved by what has actually taken place. It is well known that at the time of Lu¬ ther’s Reformation, and long before, the translat¬ ing of the Scriptures into modern languages was most earnestly opposed by those who adhered to the Church of Rome. The Scriptures, which were originally addressed to Christians of all classes, including slaves, were represented as unfit for the perusal of the common people. But since then, the Roman Catholics have in some measure followed the example of those Churches which they denounce as heretical.1 They have among them now, (though not in perfectly free circula¬ tion,) translations of Scripture into English, French, Italian, and other languages. And.some of them have also Prayer-books, with the Latin and their own language printed in parallel co¬ lumns, so as to enable them to understand the Service that is going on.2 3 There can be little doubt, therefore, that this would have been done long before, if there had been all along numerous independent Churches, such as the Apostles esta¬ blished",Rome,"US,UK,FR,IT",8,"United States,N/A,France,Italy","North America,N/A,Europe,Europe"

Such were Purbach, Regiomontanus, Commandine, Mau- rolycus, and many others. By their means, the writings of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Pappus, became known and acces¬ sible to men of science.

"What I here assert is on the authority of Mon- tucla, whose judgment in this matter may he safely relied on, as he has shown, by many in¬ stances, that he was well acquainted with the nature of the analysis referred to. It is not a little remarkable that Werner should have under¬ stood this subject, when we find many eminent mathematicians, long after his time, entiicly unacquainted with it, and continually express¬ ing their astonishment how the ancient geo¬ meters found out those simple and elegant con¬ structions and demonstrations, of which they have given so many examples. In the days of Werner there was no ancient hook known, ex¬ cept the Data of Euclid, from which any infor¬ mation concerning the geometrical analysis could he collected; and it is highly to his credit, that, without any other help, he should have come to the knowledge of a method not a little recondite in its principles, and ampng the finest inventions either of ancient or of modern science. Werner resolved, by means of it, Archimedes’s problem of cutting a sphere into two segments, having a given ratio to one another. He proposed also to translate, from the Arabic, the work of Apollo¬ nius, entitled Sectio Ratio?iis, rightly judging it to he an elementary work in that analysis, and to come next after the Data of Euclid.2 Benedetto, an Italian mathematician, appears also to have been very early acquainted with the principles of the same ingenious method, as he published a hook on the geometrical analysis at Turin in 1585","Euclid, Euclid, Turin","US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"Geometry owes to Cavulleri, not only the ge¬ neral method j ust described, but many particular theorems, which that method was the instru¬ ment of discovering. Among these is the very remarkable proposition, that as four right angles, to the excess of the three angles of any spherical triangle, above two right angles, so is the superficies of the hemisphere to the area of the triangle. At that time, however, science was advancing so fast, and the human mind was everywhere ex¬ panding itself with so much energy, that the same discovery was likely to be made by more individuals than one at the same time. It was not known in Italy in 1632, when this deter¬ mination of the area of a spherical triangle was given by Cavalleri, that it had been published three years before by Albert Girard, a mathe¬ matician of the Low Countries, of whose in¬ ventive powers we shall soon have more occa¬ sion to speak",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"The Cycloid afforded a number of problems, well calculated to exercise the proficients in the geometry of indivisibles, or of infinites. It is the curve described by a point in the circumfe¬ rence of a circle, while the circle itself rolls in a straight line along a plane. It is not quite certain when this curve, so remarkable for its curious properties, and for the place which it occupies in the history of geometry, first drew the attention of mathematicians. In the year 1639, Galileo informed his friend Torricelli, that, forty years before that time, he had thought of this curve, on account of its shape, and the graceful form it would give to arches in archi¬ tecture. The same philosopher had endeavoured to find the area of the cycloid; but though he was one of those who first introduced the con¬ sideration of infinites into geometry, he was not expert enough in the use of that doctrine, to be able to resolve this problem. It is still more extraordinary, that the same problem proved too difficult for Cavalleri, though he certainly was in complete possession of the principles by which it was to be resolved. It is, however, not easy to determine whether it be to Torricelli, the scholar of Cavalleri, and his successor in genius and talents, or to Roberval, a French mathematician of the same period, and a man also of great originality and invention, that sci¬ ence is indebted for the first quadrature of the cycloid, or the proof that its area is three times that of its generating circle. Both these mathe¬ maticians laid claim to it. The French and Italians each took the part of their own coun¬ tryman; and in their zeal have so perplexed the question, that it is hard to say on which side the truth is to be found. Torricelli, however, was a man of a mild, amiable, and candid dis¬ position ; Roberval of a temper irritable, vio¬ lent, and envious; so that, in as far as the testi¬ mony of the individuals themselves is concerned, there is no doubt which ought to preponderate",,FR,8,France,Europe
"It was not from Greece alone that the light proceeded which dispelled the darkness of the middle ages; for, with the first dawn of that light, a mathematical science, of a name and character unknown to the geometers of antiqui¬ ty, was received in Europe from Arabia. As early as the beginning of the thirteenth century, Leonardo, a merchant of Pisa, having made fre¬ quent visits to the East, in the course of com¬ mercial adventure, returned to Italy enriched by the traffic, and instructed by the science of those countries. He brought with him the know¬ ledge of Algebra; and a late writer quotes a manuscript of his, hearing the date of 1202, and another that of 1228.2 The importation of al¬ gebra into Europe is thus carried hack nearly 200 year's farther than has generally been sup¬ posed; for Leonardo has been represented as flourishing in the end of the fourteenth century, instead of the very beginning of the thirteenth",Pisa,"IT,GR",8,"Italy,Greece","Europe,Europe"

"Though in all this the moderns received none of their information from the Greeks, yet a work in the Greek language, treating of arithmetical questions, in a manner that may be accounted algebraic, was discovered in the course of the next century, and given to the world, in a Latin translation, by Xylander, in 1575. This is the work of Diophantus of Alexandria, who had composed thirteen books of Arithmetical Ques¬ tions, and is supposed to have flourished about 150 years after the Christian era. The ques¬ tions he resolves are often of considerable diffi¬ culty ; and a great deal of address is displayed in stating them, so as to bring out equations of such a form as to involve only one power of the unknown quantity. The expression is that of common language, abbreviated and assisted by a few symbols. The investigations do not ex¬ tend beyond quadratic equations; they are, however, extremely ingenious, and prove the author to have been a man of talent, though the instrument he worked with was weak and im- pei’fect",Alexandria,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"
"Before his time very little advance had been made in the solution of any equations higher than the second degree; except that, as we are told, about the year 1508, Scipio Ferrei, Profes¬ sor of Mathematics at Bologna, had found out a rule for resolving one of the cases of cubic equa¬ tions, which, however, he concealed, or commu¬ nicated only to a few of his scholars. One of these, Florido, on the strength of the secret he possessed, agreeably to a practice then common among mathematicians, challenged Tartalea of Brescia, to contend with him in the solution of algebraic problems. Florido had at first the ad¬ vantage ; but Tartalea, being a man of ingenuity, soon discovered his rule, and also another much more general, in consequence of which he came off at last victorious. By the report of this vic¬ tory, the curiosity of Cardan was strongly ex¬ cited ; for, though he was himself much versed in the Mathematics, he had not been able to dis¬ cover a method of resolving equations higher than the second degree. By the most earnest and importunate solicitation, he wrung from Tartalea the secret of his rules, hut not till he had hound himself, by promises and oaths, never to divulge them. Tartalea did not communicate the demonstrations, which, however, Cardan soon found out, and extended, in a very inge¬ nious and systematic manner, to all cubic equa¬ tions whatsoever’. Thus possessed of an import¬ ant discovery, which was at least in a great part his orvn, he soon forgot his promises to Tartalea, and published the whole in 1545, not concealing, however, what he owed to the latter. Though a proceeding so directly contrary to an express stipulation cannot be defended, one does not much regret the disappointment of any man who would make a mystery of knowledge, or keep his discoveries a secret, for purposes mere¬ ly selfish","Bologna, Brescia",IT,8,Italy,Europe
"Italy was not the only country into which the algebraic analysis had hy this time found its way : in Germany it had also made considerable progress; and Stiphelius, in a hook of algebra, published at Nuremberg in 1544, employed the same numeral exponents of powers, both posi¬ tive and negative, which we now use, as far as integer numbers are concerned; hut he did not carry the solution of equations farther than the second degree. He introduced the same charac¬ ters for plus and minus which are at present em¬ ployed",,"IT,DE",8,"Italy,Germany","Europe,Europe"
"The properties of algebraic equations were discovered, however, very slowly. Pelitarius, a French mathematician, in a treatise which hears the date of 1558, is the first who observed that the root of an equation is a divisor of the last term; and he remarked also this curious pro¬ perty of numbers, that the sum of the cubes of the natural numbers is the square of the sum of the numbers themselves",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The knowledge of the solution of cubic equa¬ tions was still confined to Italy. Bombelli, a mathematician of that country, gave a regular treatise on Algebra, and considered, with very particular attention, the irreducible case of Car¬ dan’s rule.

He has also given new demonstrations of the rule for resolving cubic, and even biquadratic equations",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"He also discovered the relation between the roots of an equation of any degree, and the coefficients of its terms, though only in the case where none of the terms are wanting, and where all the roots are real or positive.

He adds, that in this manuscript he had found the Indian authors often quoted; from which it appeared that algebra was known to the Indians before it was known to the Arabians.

"With the Greeks, the time was very short during which physical science flourished in any degree. The seven Sages, with the exception of Thales, applied themselves entirely to morals and politics; and in later times, after Socrates had brought down philosophy from the heavens to the earth, the study of nature was generally abandoned. In the Roman republic, the know¬ ledge most cultivated, as might be expected among a martial and ambitious people, was such as had a direct reference to war and poli¬ tics. During the empire, the introduction and establishment of the Christian religion drew the attention of men to theological studies, and the important interests which were then at stake left but a small share of talent and ability to be occupied in inferior pursuits.

In a trea¬ tise which bears the date of 1577, he reduced the pulley to the lever; but with respect to the inclined plane, he continued in the same error with Pappus Alexandrinus, supposing that a certain force must be applied to sustain a body, even on a plane which has no inclination",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
The person who comes next in the history of mechanics made a great revolution in the phy¬ sical sciences.

From observing the vibrations of the lamps in the cathedral, he also arrived at this very important conclusion in mechanics, that the great and the small vibrations of the same pendulum are performed in the same time, and that this time depends only on the length of the pendulum.

"Though the reasonings of Galileo certainly in¬ volve the knowledge of the disposition which matter has to preserve its condition either of rest or of rectilineal and uniform motion, the first distinct enunciation of this law is found in the writings of the French philosopher. It is, however, there represented, not as mere inacti¬ vity, or indifference, but as a real force, which bodies exert in order to preserve their state of rest or of motion; and this inaccuracy affects some of the reasonings concerning their action on one another",,FR,8,France,Europe

"After laying down the hypothesis of certain epi¬ cycles, and their dimensions, it is usual with him to add, “ these suppositions will save the pheno¬ mena.” Saxe is the literal translation of the Greek word, which is always a part of the verb Ss^e/i/, or some of its compounds. Thus, in treat¬ ing of certain phenomena in the moon’s motion, he lays down two hypotheses, by either of which they may be expressed; and he concludes, “ in this way the similitude of the ratios, and the pro¬ portionality of the times, will be saved (biacutpim) on both suppositions.” 1 It is plain, from these words, that the astronomer did not here consi¬ der himself as describing any thing which ac¬ tually existed, but as explaining two artifices, by either of which, certain irregularities in the moon’s motion may be represented, in consist¬ ence with the principle of uniform velocity. The hypothesis does not relate to the explanation, but merely to the expression of the fact; it is first assumed, and its merit is then judged of synthetically, by its power to save, to reconcile, or to represent appearances. At a time when the mathematical sciences extended little beyond the elements, and when problems which could not be resolved by circles and straight lines could hardly be resolved at all, such artifices as the preceding were of the greatest value. They were even more valuable than the truth itself would have been in such circumstances; and nothing is more certain than that the real elliptical orbits of the planets, and the uni¬ form description of areas, would have been very unseasonable discoveries at the period we are now treating of. The hypotheses of epi¬ cycles and of centres of uniform motion were well accommodated to the state of science, and are instances of a false system which has materially contributed to the establishment of truth",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"In the middle ages, remarkable for the mixture of a few fragments of knowledge and truth in a vast mass of ignorance and error, it was assi¬ duously cultivated, and, in conjunction with alchemy and magic, shared the favour of the people, and the patronage of the great.

He published a new edition of the Almagest, and, though he neither understood Greek nor Arabic, his know¬ ledge of the subject enabled him to make it much more perfect than any of the former trans¬ lations.

"The discoveries of Kepler were secrets extort¬ ed from nature by the most profound and labo¬ rious research. The astronomical discoveries of Galileo, more brilliant and imposing, were made at a far less expense of intellectual labour. By this it is not meant to say that Galileo did not possess, and did not exert, intellectual powers of the very highest order; but it was less in his astronomical discoveries that he had occasion to exert them, than in those which concerned the theory of motion.

"An hypothesis advanced by Ward, bishop of Salisbury, was simpler and more accurate than that of the French astronomer. According to it, the line drawn from a planet to the superior focus of its elliptic orbit, turns with a uniform angular Arelocity round that point. In orbits of small eccentricity, this is nearly true, and al¬ most coincides in such cases with Kepler’s prin¬ ciple of the uniform description of areas. Dr Ward, however, did not consider the matter in that light; he assumed his hypothesis as true, guided, it would seem, by nothing but the opin¬ ion, that a centre of uniform motion must some- where exist, and pleased with the simplicity thus introduced into astronomical calculation. It is indeed remarkable, as Montucla has observed, how little the most enlightened astronomers of that time seem to have studied or under¬ stood the laws discovered by Kepler. Riccioli, of whom we are just about to speak, enumerates all the suppositions that had been laid down concerning the velocities of the planets, but makes no mention of their describing equal areas in equal times round the sun.

"This method of deciding the question was not resorted to. Hevelius and Hooke had a very serious controversy concerning it, in which the advantage remained with the latter. It should have been observed, that the French astronomer Picard was the first who employed instruments furnished with telescopic sights, about the year 1665. It appears, however, that Gascoigne, an English gentleman who fell at the battle of Marston-moor in 1644, had anticipated the French astronomer in this invention, but that it had remained entirely unknown.

This task was performed by the elder Cassini, who was invited from Italy, his native country, b\ Louis the Fourteenth, and settled in France in 1669.

"The theory of the motions of these small bodies is a research of great difficulty, and had been attempted by many astronomers before Cassini, with very little success. The planes of the orbits, their inclinations to the orbit of Jupiter, and the lines in which they intersected that orbit, were all to be determined, as well as the times of revolution, and the distances of each from its primary. Add to this, that it is only in a few points of their orbits that they can be observed with advantage. The best are at the times of immersion into the shadow of Jupiter, and emersion from it. The same excellent astronomer discovered four satellites of Saturn, in addition to that already observed by Huy¬ gens. He also discovered the rotation of Jupi¬ ter and of Mars upon their axes","Jupiter, Jupiter, Huy","US,BE",8,"United States,Belgium","North America,Europe"
"The first idea of this institution seems to have been suggested by the writings of Bacon, who, in recommending the use of experiment, had severely censured the schools, colleges, and aca¬ demies of his own time, as adverse to the ad¬ vancement of knowledge;1 * * * and, in the Nova Atlantis, had given a most interesting sketch of the form of a society directed to scientific im¬ provement. In Germany, the Academia Natures Curiosorum dates its commencement from 1652; and the historian of that institution ascribes the spirit which produced it to the writings of the philosopher just named. These examples, and a feeling that the union and co-operation of numbers were necessary to the progress of expe¬ rimental philosophy, operated still more exten¬ sively. The Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris was founded in 1666, in the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, and during the administration of Colbert. The Institute of Bologna in Italy belongs nearly to the same period; but almost all the other philosophical associations, of which there are now so many, had their beginning in the eighteenth century","Atlantis, Paris, Bologna","IT,ZA,US",8,"Italy,South Africa,United States","Europe,Africa,North America"
"The Royal Society of London is an associa¬ tion of men, who, without salaries or appoint¬ ment from Government, defray, by private con¬ tribution, the expense of their meetings, and of their publications. This last is another im¬ portant service which a society so constituted renders to science",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"On the revival of letters in Europe, establish¬ ments of the same kind were the first decisive indications of a taste for science. We have seen the magnificent observatory on which Tycho ex¬ pended his private fortune, and employed the munificence of his patron, become a sad memo¬ rial (after the signal services which it had ren¬ dered to astronomy) of the instability of what¬ ever depends on individual greatness. The ob¬ servatories at Paris and London were secured from a similar fate, by being made national es¬ tablishments, where a succession of astronomers were to devote themselves to the study of the heavens. The observatory at Paris was begun in 1667, and that at Greenwich in 1675. In the first of these, La Hire and Cassini, in the second, Flamsteed and Halley, are at the head of a series of successors who have done honour to their respective nations. If there be in Britain any establishment, in the success and conduct of which the nation has reason to boast, it is that of the Royal Observatory, which, in spite of a climate which so continually tries the pa¬ tience, and so often disappoints the hopes of the astronomer, has furnished a greater number of observations to be completely relied on, than all the rest of Europe put together, and afforded the data for those tables in which the French mathematicians have expressed, with such accu¬ racy, the past, the present, and the future con¬ dition of the heavens","Paris, London, Paris","US,GB,FR",8,"United States,United Kingdom,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The slowness with which the art of making ac¬ curate experiments and observations has been matured, and tbe great distance it has kept be¬ hind theory, is a remarkable fact in the history of the physical sciences. It has been remarked, that mathematicians had found out the area of the circle, and calculated its circumference to more than a hundred places of decimals, before artists had divided an arch into minutes of a de¬ gree ; and that many excellent treatises had been written on the properties of curves, before a straight line had been drawn of any considerable length, or measured with any tolerable exact¬ ness, on the surface of the globe.1 The next measurement on record is that of the astronomers of Almamon, in the plains of Me¬ sopotamia ; and the manner of conducting the operation appears to have been far more accu¬ rate than that of the Greek philosophers; but, from a want of knowledge of the measures em¬ ployed, it has conveyed no information to pos¬ terity",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"The first arch of the meridian, measured in modern times with an accuracy any way cor¬ responding to the difficulty of the problem, was by Snellius, a Dutch mathematician, who has given an account of it in a volume which he calls Eratosthenes Batavus, published in 1617",,NL,8,Netherlands,Europe
"A computation which, for the time, deserves considerable praise, is that of Norwood, in 1635, who measured the distance between London and York, taking the bearings as he proceeded along the road, and reducing all to the direction of the meridian, and to the horizontal plane. The dif¬ ference of latitude he found, by observation of tbe solstices, to be 2° 28'; and from that and his measured distance, he concluded the degree to be 367,176 feet English, or 57,800 toises. This has been found to be a near approximation; yet his method was not capable of great accuracy, nor did he always execute it in the best manner","Norwood, London, York","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"“ Sometimes,” says he, “ I measured, sometimes I paced ; and I believe I am within a scantling of the truth.” Fernel, a French physician, measured with a wheel from Paris to Amiens, which are nearly in the same meridian, and he determined the de¬ gree from thence to be 56,746 French toises ; a result which falls short of the truth, though not very considerably","Paris, Amiens","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"These investigations, it is plain, could not but leave considerable uncertainty with respect to the magnitude of the earth. The Academy of Sciences became interested in the question, and the measurement of an arch in the meridian was un¬ dertaken under its auspices, and executed by the Abbe Picard, already known for his skill in the operations of practical geometry. He followed a method similar to that of Snellius, according to which, the distance between Amiens and Mal- voisine was found from a series of triangles, and a base of 5663^ toises. He determined the dif¬ ference of latitude by means of a zenith sector of ten feet radius, and found it to be 1° 22' 55"". The whole distance was 78,850 toises, whence the degree came out 57,060 toises. This was the first measurement of a degree of the meridian on which perfect reliance could be placed",Amiens,FR,8,France,Europe
"The most remarkable circumstance, however, which occurred in the course of this voyage, was, that the clock, though furnished with a pendu¬ lum of the same length which vibrated seconds at Paris, was found, at Cayenne, to lose two minutes and a half a-day nearly. This created great astonishment in France, especially after the accuracy of it was confirmed by the observa¬ tions of Varin and Deshayes, who, some years afterwards, visited different places on the coasts of Africa and America, near the line, and found the necessity of shortening the pendulum, to make it vibrate seconds in those latitudes. The first explanation of this remarkable phenomenon was given by Newton, in the third book of his Principia, published in 1687, where it is de¬ duced as a necessary consequence of the earth’s rotation on its axis, and of the centrifugal force thence arising. That force changes both the di¬ rection and the intensity of gravity, giving to the earth an oblate spheroidal figure, more elevated at the equator than the poles, and making bodies fall, and pendulums vibrate, more slowly in low than in high latitudes","Paris, Cayenne, Newton","US,FR,GF",8,"United States,France,French Guiana","North America,Europe,South America"
"This solution, however, did not, any more than the book in which it was contained, make its way very readily into France. The first expla¬ nation of the retardation of the pendulum, which was received there, was given by Huygens in 1690. Huygens deduced it also from the cen¬ trifugal force, arising from the earth’s rotation, and the view which he took was simpler, though much less accurate than that of Newton. It had indeed the simplicity which often arises from neglecting one of the essential conditions of a problem; but it was nevertheless ingenious, and involved a very accurate knowledge of the nature of centrifugal force.—I am thus brought to touch on a subject which belongs properly to the second part of this Dissertation, for which the fuller discussion of it must of course be reserved",Newton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"622 PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS* struct mirrors both plane and spherical. They made them also conical; and it appears from Plutarch, that the fire of Vesta, when extin¬ guished, was not permitted to be rekindled hut by the rays of the sun, which were condensed by a conical speculum of copper. The minors with which Archimedes set fire to the Roman galleys have been subjects of much discussion, and the fact was long disbelieved, on the ground of being physically impossible. The experi¬ ments of Kircher and Buffon showed that this impossibility was entirely imaginary, and that the effect ascribed to the specula of the Greek geometer might be produced without much dif¬ ficulty. There remains now no doubt of their reality. A passage from Aristophanes1 gives reason to believe that, in his time, lenses of glass were used for burning, by collecting the rays of the sun; but in a matter that concerns the history of science, the authority of a comic poet and a satirist would not deserve much at¬ tention, if it were not confirmed by more sober testimony. Pliny, speaking of rock crystal,2 3 says that a globe or ball of that substance was sometimes used by the physicians for collecting the rays of the sun, in order to perform the operation of cautery. In another passage, he mentions the power of a glass globe filled with water, to produce a strong heat when exposed to the rays of the sunj and expresses his sur¬ prise that the water itself should all the while remain quite cold",Roman,"RO,GR",8,"Romania,Greece","Europe,Europe"
"An interval of nearly a thousand years divid¬ ed Ptolemy from Alhazen, who, in the history of optical discovery, appears as his immediate successor. This ingenious Arabian lived in the eleventh century, and his merit can be more fairly, and will be more highly appreciated, now that the work of his predecessor has become known. The merit of his book on Optics was al¬ ways admitted; but he was supposed to have bor¬ rowed much from Ptolemy, without acknowledg¬ ing it; and the prejudices entertained in favour of a Greek author, especially of one who had been for so many years a legislator in science, gave a false impression, both of the genius and the integrity of his modern rival. The work of Al¬ hazen is, nevertheless, in many respects, supe¬ rior to that of Ptolemy, and in nothing more than in the geometry which it employs. The problem known by his name, to find the point in a spherical speculum, at which a ray coming from one given point shall be reflected to ano¬ ther given point, is very well resolved in his book, though a problem of so much difficulty, that Montucla hazards the opinion, that no Ara¬ bian geometer was ever equal to the solution of it.4 It is now certain, however, that the solu¬ tion, from whatever quarter it came, was not borrowed from Ptolemy, in whose work no men¬ tion is made of any such question; and it may very well be doubted, whether, had this problem 1 Aristophanis Nubes, v. 766. edit.

"Prolixity and want of method are the faults of Alhazen. Vitello,1 a learned Pole, comment¬ ed on his works, and has very much improved their method and arrangement in a treatise pub¬ lished in 1270. He has also treated more fully of the subject of refraction, and reduced the re¬ sults of his experiments into the form of a table, exhibiting the angles of refraction corresponding to the angles of incidence, which he had tried in water and glass. It was not, however, till long after this period that the law which connects these angles was discovered. The cause of re¬ traction appeared to him to be the resistance which the rays suffer in passing into the denser medium of water or glass; and one can see in his reasoning an obscure idea of the resolution of forces. He also treats of the rainbow, and remarks, that the altitude of the sun and bow together always amount to 42 degrees. He next considers the structure of the eye, of which he has given a tolerably accurate description; and proves, as Alhazen had before done,9 that vision is not performed by the emission of rays from the eye",,PL,8,Poland,Europe

Descartes paid little attention to those who had gone before him, and, as already remarked, never once mentioned the archbishop of Spalatro. Like Aristotle, he seems to have formed the design of cutting off the memory of all his predecessors; but the in¬ vention of printing had made this a far more hopeless undertaking than it was in the days of the Greek philosopher",Newton,"US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"About this time Grimaldi, a learned Jesuit, the companion of Riccioli, in his astronomical labours, made known some optical phenomena which had hitherto escaped observation. They respected the action of bodies on light, and when compared with reflection and refraction, might be called, in the language of Bacon’s philosophy, crepuscular instances, indicating an action of the same kind, but much weaker and less percep¬ tible. Having stretched a hair across a sun¬ beam, admitted through a hole in the window- shutter of a dark chamber, he was surprised to find the shadow much larger than the natural divergence of the rays could have led him to expect. Other facts of the same kind made known the general law of the diffraction or in¬ flection of light, and showed that the rays are acted on by bodies, and turned out of their rec¬ tilineal course, even when not in contact, but at a measurable distance from the surfaces or edges of such bodies. Grimaldi gave an account of those facts in a treatise printed at Bologna in 1665.1 * Optics, as indeed all the branches of Natural Philosophy, have great obligations to Huygens",Bologna,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"It is not, however, in this general view that the ingenuity of the theory appears, but in its application to explain the equality of the angles of incidence and reflection; and, most of all, the constant ratio which subsists between the sines of the angles of incidence and of refrac¬ tion. Few things are to be met with more simple and beautiful than this last application of the theory; but that which is most remarkable of all is, the use made of it to explain the double refraction of Iceland crystal. This crystal, which is no other than the calcareous spar of mineral¬ ogists, has not only the property of refracting light in the usual manner of glass, water, and other transparent bodies, but it has also another power of refraction, by which even the rays falling perpendicularly on the surface of the crystal are turned out of their course, so that a double image is formed of all objects seen through these crystals. This property belongs not only to calcareous spar, but, in a greater or less degree, 1 Physico-Mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus, S^c. 4to",,IS,8,Iceland,Europe
"The common refraction is explained by Huy¬ gens, on the supposition that the undulations in the luminous fluid are propagated in the form of spherical waves. The double refraction is explained on the supposition that the undula¬ tions of light, in passing through the calcareous spar, assume a spheroidal form; and this hypo¬ thesis, though it does not apply with the same simplicity as the former, yet admits of such pre¬ cision, that a proportion of the axes of the sphe¬ roids may be assigned, which will account for the precise quantity of the extraordinary refrac¬ tion, and for all the phenomena dependent on it, which Huygens had studied with great care, and had reduced to the smallest number of general facts. That these spheroidal undulations ac¬ tually exist, he would, after all, be a bold theo¬ rist who should affirm ; but, that the supposition of their existence is an accurate expression of the phenomena of double refraction, cannot be doubted. When one enunciates the hypothesis of the spheroidal undulations, he, in fact, ex¬ presses in a single sentence all the phenomena of double refraction. The hypothesis is there¬ fore the means of representing these phenomena, and the laws which they obey, to the imagina¬ tion or the understanding; and there is perhaps no theory in optics, and but very few in natural philosophy, of which more can be said. Theory, therefore, in this instance, is merely to be re¬ garded as the expression of a general law; and in that light, I think, it is considered by La¬ place",Huy,BE,8,Belgium,Europe
"635 guided in its first discoveries. Here we are pro¬ ceeding on the authority of the author himself; for in a letter to Oldenburg,1 * Secretary of the Royal Society of London, he has entered into considerable detail on this subject, adding, (so ready are the steps ot invention to be forgotten) that the facts would have entirely escaped his memory, if he had not been reminded of them by some notes which he had made at the time, and which he had accidentally fallen on. The whole of the letter just referred to is one of the most valuable documents to he found in the his¬ tory of invention","Oldenburg, London","DE,GB",8,"Germany,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"These discoveries, however, even before the press was employed as their vehicle, could not remain altogether unknown in a country where the mathematical sciences were cultivated with zeal and diligence. Barrow, to whom they were first made known by the author himself, com¬ municated them to Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society, who had a very extensive cor¬ respondence all over Europe. By him the series for the quadrature of the circle were made known to James Gregory, in Scotland, who had oc¬ cupied himself very much with the same subject",Oldenburg,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"the study of that science, he was soon m a con¬ dition to make new discoveries. He invented a method of squaring the circle, by transforming it into another curve of an equal area, but hav¬ ing the ordinate expressed by a rational fraction of the absciss, so that its area could be found by the methods already known. In this way he discovered the series, so remarkable for its sim¬ plicity, which gives the value of a circular arch in terms of the tangent. This series he com¬ municated to Oldenburg in 1674, and received from him in return an account of the progress made by Newton and Gregory in the invention of series. In 1676, Newton described his me¬ thod of quadratures at the request of Olden¬ burg, in order that it might be transmitted to Leibnitz, in the two letters already mentioned, as of such value, by recording the views which guided that great geometer in his earliest, and some of his most important discoveries. The method of fluxions is not communicated in these letters; nor are the principles of it in any way suggested; though there are, in the last letter, two sentences in transposed characters, which ascertain that Newton was then in possession of that method, and employed in speaking of it the same language in which it was afterwards made known. In the following year, Leibnitz, in a letter to Oldenburg, introduces differentials, and the methods of his calculus, for the first time.

This re¬ port forms what is called the Commercium Epis- iolicum ; it was published by order of the Royal Society the year following, and contains an ac¬ count of the facts, which, though in the main fair and just, does not give that impression of the impartiality of the reporters which the cir¬ cumstances so imperiously demanded.

The habit of studying only our own authors on these subjects, produced at first by our admiration of Newton and our dis¬ like to his rivals, and increased by a circum¬ stance very insignificant in itself, the diversity of notation, prevented us from partaking in the pursuits of our neighbours, and cut us off in a great measure from the vast field in which the genius of France, of Germany, and Italy, was exercised with so much activity and success",Newton,"FR,DE,IT,US",8,"France,Germany,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"
"It must not be supposed that so great a revo¬ lution in science as that which was made by the introduction of the new analysis could be brought about entirely without opposition, as in every society there are some who think them¬ selves interested to maintain things in the con¬ dition wherein they have found them. The con¬ siderations are indeed sufficiently obvious, which, in the moral and political world, tend to pro¬ duce this effect, and to give a stability to human institutions, often so little proportionate to their real value or to their general utility. Even in matters purely intellectual, and in which the abstract truths of arithmetic and geometry seem alone concerned, the prejudices, the selfishness, or vanity of those who pursue them, not unfre- quently combine to resist improvement, and of¬ ten engage no inconsiderable degree of talent in drawing back, instead of pushing forward, the machine of science. The introduction of me¬ thods entirely new must often change the rela¬ tive place of the men engaged in scientific pur¬ suits ; and must oblige many, after descending from the stations they formerly occupied, to take a lower position in the scale of intellectual ad¬ vancement. The enmity of such men, if they be not animated by a spirit of real candour and the love of truth, is likely to be directed against metbods by which their vanity is mortified, and their importance lessened. Though such changes as this must have everywhere accompanied the ascendency acquired by the calculus, for the credit of mathematicians it must be observed, that no one of any considerable eminence has had the misfortune to enrol his name among the adversaries of the new science; and that Huy¬ gens, the most distinguished and most profound of the older mathematicians then living, was one of the most forward to acknowledge the ex¬ cellence of that science, and to make himself master of its rules, and of their application",Huy,BE,8,Belgium,Europe

"The geometry of infinites had both these faults, and particularly the latter.” After all these disputes were quieted in France, and the new analysis appeared completely vic¬ torious, it had an attack to sustain in England from a more formidable quarter. Berkeley, bi¬ shop of Cloyne, wns a man of first-rate talents, distinguished as a metaphysician, a philosopher, and a divine. His geometrical knowledge, how¬ ever, which, for an attack on the method of fluxions, was more essential than all his other accomplishments, seems to have been little more than elementary. The motive which induced him to enter on discussions so remotely connect¬ ed with his usual pursuits, has been variously represented; but, whatever it was, it gave rise to the Analyst, in which the author professes to demonstrate, that the new analysis is inaccurate in its principles, and that if it ever lead to true conclusions, it is from an accidental compensa¬ tion of errors that cannot be supposed always to take place. The argument is ingeniously and plausibly conducted, and the author sometimes attempts ridicule with better success than could be expected from the subject: thus, when he calls ultimate ratios the ghosts of departed quan¬ tities, it is not easy to conceive a witty saying more happily fastened on a mere mathematical abstraction",Berkeley,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"No one indeed had ever thought of questioning the conformity of this measure to the phenomena of nature, when, in 1686, Leibnitz announced in the Leipsic Journal the demonstration of a great error committed by Descartes and others, in esti¬ mating the force of moving bodies. In this paper the author endeavoured to show, that the force of a moving body is not proportional to its velo¬ city simply, but to the square of its velocity; and he supported this new doctrine by very plausible reasoning. A body, he says, projected upward against gravity, with a double velocity, ascends to four times the height; with the triple veloci¬ ty, to nine times the height; and so on, the height ascended to being always as the square of the velocity. But the height ascended to is the effect, and is the natural measure of the force; therefore the force of a moving body is as the square of its velocity. Such was the first rea¬ soning of Leibnitz on this subject,—simple, and apparently conclusive; nor should it be forgotten that, during the long period to which the dis¬ pute was lengthened out, and notwithstanding the various shapes which it assumed, the reason¬ ings on his side were nothing more than this ori¬ ginal argument, changed in its form, or render¬ ed more complex by the combination of new circumstances, so as to be more bewildering to the imagination, and more difficult either to ap¬ prehend or to refute.1 John Bernoulli was at first of a different opinion from his friend and master, but came at length to adopt the same; which, however, ap¬ pears to have gone no farther till the discourse was submitted to the Academy of Sciences, as has been already mentioned. The mathematical world could not look with indifference on a question which seemed to affect the vitals of mechanical science, and soon separated into two parties, in the arrangement of which, however, the effects of national predilection might easily be discovered. Germany, Holland, and Italy, declared for the vis viva ; England stood firm for the old doctrine; and France was divided between the two opinions. No controversy, 1 To mere pressure Leibnitz gave the name of vis mortva. and to the force of moving bodies the name of vis viva. The former he admitted to be proportional to the simple power of the virtual velocity, and the second he held to be proportion* al to the square of the actual veloci ty",Holland,"DE,IT,FR,US",8,"Germany,Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"

"A Dissertation of Mairan, on the Force of moving Bodies, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1728, is one of those in which the common measure of force is most ably support¬ ed. Nevertheless, for a long time after this, the opinions on that subject in France continued still to be divided.

"659 His observations on evaporation were the foun¬ dation of two valuable papers on the origin of fountains; in which, for the first time, the suffi¬ ciency of the vapour taken up into the atmo¬ sphere, to maintain the perennial flow of springs and rivers, was established by undeniable evi¬ dence. The difficulty which men found in con¬ ceiving how a precarious and accidental supply like that of the rains can sufficiently provide for a great and regular expenditure like that of the rivers, had given rise to those various opin¬ ions concerning the origin of fountains, which had hitherto divided the scientific world. A long residence on the summit of an insulated rock, in the midst of a vast ocean, visited twice every year by the vertical sun, would have af¬ forded to an observer less quick-sighted than Halley, an opportunity of seeing the work of evaporation carried on with such rapidity and copiousness as to be a subject of exact measure¬ ment. From this extreme case, he could infer the medium quantity, at least by approximation ; and he proved that, in the Mediterranean, the humidity daily raised up by evaporation is three times as great as that which is discharged by all the rivers that flow into it. The origin of foun¬ tains was no longer questioned; and of the mul¬ titude of opinions on that subject, which had hitherto perplexed philosophers, all but one en¬ tirely disappeared.1 Beside the voyage to St Helena, Halley made two others; the British government having been enlightened and liberal enough to despise pro¬ fessional etiquette, where the interests of science were at stake, and to intrust to a Doctor of Laws the command of a ship of war, in which he traversed the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in various directions, as far as the 53d degree of south latitude, and returned with a collection of facts and observations for the improvement of geography, meteorology, and navigation, far beyond that which any individual traveller or voyager had hitherto brought together",,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"It was in this period also that electricity may be said first to have taken a scientific form. The power of amber to attract small bodies after it has been rubbed, is said to have been known to Thales, and is certainly made mention of by Theophrastus. The observations of Gilbert, a physician of Colchester, in the end of the six¬ teenth century, though at the distance of two thousand years, made the first addition to the transient and superficial remarks of the Greek naturalist, and afford a pretty full enumeration of the bodies which can be rendered electrical by friction. The Academia del Cimento, Boyle, and Otto Guericke, followed in the same course; and the latter is the first who mentions the crackling noise and faint light which electricity sometimes produced. These, however, were hardly perceived, and it was by Dr Wall, as described in the Philosophical Transactions, that they were first distinctly observed.1 By a sin¬ gularly fortunate anticipation, he remarks of the light and crackling, that they seemed in some degree to represent thunder and light¬ ning","Gilbert, Colchester","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

It is plain, from what is said above, that the phenomena of the prismatic spectrum were not unknown at that time, however little they were understood, and however imperfectly observed","Oldenburg, Newton","DE,US",8,"Germany,United States","Europe,North America"
"Huygens, writing to one of his friends, says of them, and of the truths they were the means of making known, <c Quorum respectu omnia hue usque edita jejunia sunt et prorsus puerilia.” Such were the sentiments of the person who, of all men living, was the best able to judge, and had the best right to be fastidious, in what related to optical experiments and discoveries. But all were not equally candid with the Dutch philo¬ sopher ; and though the discovery now commu¬ nicated had every thing to recommend it which can arise from what is great, new, and singu¬ lar ; though it was not a theory or a system of opinions, but the generalization of facts made known by experiments; and though it was brought forward in the most simple and unpre¬ tending form, a host of enemies appeared, each eager to obtain the unfortunate pre-eminence of being the first to attack conclusions which the unanimous voice of posterity was to con¬ firm. In this contention, the envy and activity of Hooke did not fail to give him the advantage; and he communicated his objections to Newton’s conclusions concerning the refrangibility of light in less than a month after they had been read in the Royal Society. He admitted the accuracy of the experiments themselves, but denied that the cause of the colour is any quality residing permanently in the rays of light, any more than that the sounds emitted from the pipes of an or¬ gan exist originally in the air. An imaginary analogy between sound and light seems to have been the basis of all his optical theories. He conceived that colour is nothing but the dis¬ turbance of light by pulses propagated through it; that blackness proceeds from the scarcity, whiteness from the plenty, of undisturbed light ; and that the prism acts by exciting different pulses in this fluid, which pulses give rise to the sensations of colour. This obscure and unin¬ telligible theory (if we may honour what is un¬ intelligible with the name of a theory) he ac¬ companied with a multitude of captious objec¬ tions to the reasonings of Newton, whom he was not ashamed to charge with borrowing from him without acknowledgement. To all this Newton replied, with the solidity, calmness, and modes¬ ty, which became the understanding and the temper of a true philosopher","Newton, Newton, Newton","US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"

"Newton, however, himself possessed excellent hands for mechanical operations, and could use them to better purpose than is common with men so much immersed in deep and abstract speculation. It appears, indeed, that mechani¬ cal invention was one of the powers of his mind which began to unfold itself at a very early pe¬ riod. In some letters subjoined to a Memoir drawn up after his death by his nephew Conduit, it is said, that, when a boy, Newton used to amuse himself with constructing machines, mills, &c. on a small scale, in which he displayed great ingenuity; and it is probable that he then acquired that use of his hands which is so diffi¬ cult to be learned at a later period. To this, probably, we owe the neatness and ingenuity with which the optical experiments above re¬ ferred to were contrived and executed,—experi¬ ments of so difficult a nature, that any error in the manipulation would easily defeat the effect, and appears actually to have done so with many of those who objected to his experiments.1 1 The Memoir of Conduit was sent to Fontenelle when he was preparing the Eloge on Newton, hut he seems o a paid little attention to it, and has passed over the early part of his life with the remark, that one may apply to im w Lucan says of the Nile, that it has not been “ permitted to mortals to see that river in a feeble state.” It the letters a referred to had formed a part of this communication, I think the Secretary of the Academy would ha.ve sacimce a comparison to an instructive fact.

"Newton, after considering the reflection and re¬ fraction of light, proceeded, in the third and last book of his Optics, to treat of its inflection, a sub¬ ject which, as has been remarked in the former part of this Dissertation, was first treated of by Grimaldi. Newton having admitted a ray of light through a hole in a window-shutter into a dark chamber, made it pass by the edge of a knife, or, in some experiments, between the edges of two knives, fixed parallel and very near to one another; and, by receiving the light on a sheet of paper at different distances behind the knives, he observed the coloured fringes which had been described by the Italian optician, and, on ex¬ amination, found that the rays had been acted on in passing the knife-edges both by repulsive and attractive forces, and had begun to be so acted on in a sensible degree when they were yet distant by of an inch of the edges of the knives.

"In 1666, the plague forced him to retire from Cambridge into the country; and, as he sat one day alone, in a garden, musing on the nature of the mysterious force by which the phenomena at the earth’s surface are so much regulated, he observed the apples falling spontaneously from the trees, and the thought occurred to him,— since gravity is a tendency not confined to bodies on the very surface of the earth, but reaching to the tops of trees, to the tops of the highest buildings, nay, to the summits of the most lofty mountains, without its intensity or direction suffering any sensible change, why may it not reach to a much greater distance, and even to the moon itself?

"The mutual gravitation of all bodies being ad¬ mitted, it was evident, that while the planets were describing their orbits round the greatest and most powerful body in the system, they must mutually attract one another; and thence, in their revolutions, some irregularities, some deviations from the description of equal areas in equal times, and from the laws of the elliptic motion, might be expected. Such irregularities, however, had not been observed at that time in the motion of any of the planets, except the moon, where some of them were so conspicuous as to have been known to Hipparchus and 1 Dialogo iv.: Opere, tom.

"From the figure of the earth thus determined, he showed that the intensity of gravity at any point of the surface is inversely as the distance of that point from the centre; and its increase, therefore, on going from the equator to the poles, is as the square of the sine of the latitude, the same ratio in which the degrees of the meridian increase.1 As the intensity of gravity diminish¬ ed on going from the poles to the equator, or from the higher to the lower latitudes, it follow¬ ed that a pendulum of a given length would vibrate slower when carried from Europe into the torrid zone. The observations of the two French astronomers Varin and De Hayes, made at Cayenne and Martinique, had already confirm¬ ed this conclusion",Cayenne,"MQ,GF,FR",8,"Martinique,French Guiana,France","North America,South America,Europe"
"Small as this force is, when it is applied to every particle of the ocean, it is capable of pro¬ ducing a sensible effect. The manner in which Newton estimates this effect can only be con¬ sidered as affording an approximation to the truth. In treating of the figure of the earth, he had shown that the centrifugal force, amount¬ ing to jig of gravity, was able to raise the level of the ocean more than seventeen miles, or, more exactly, 85,472 French feet. Hence, making the effect proportional to the forces, the elevation of the waters produced by the solar force will come out 1*92 foot",Newton,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"But, from the comparison of the neap and spring tides, that is, of the difference and the sum of the lunar and solar forces, it appears that the force of the moon is to that of the sun as 4*48 to 1.

"When one considers the splendour of New¬ ton’s discoveries, the beauty, the simplicity, and grandeur of the system they unfolded, and the demonstrative evidence by which that system was supported, one could hardly doubt that, to he received, it required only to he made known, and that the establishment of the Newtonian philosophy all over Europe would very quickly have followed the publication of it. In drawing this conclusion, however, we should make much too small an allowance for the influence of re¬ ceived opinion, and the resistance that mere ha¬ bit is able, for a time, to oppose to the strongest evidence. The Cartesian system of vortices had many followers in all the countries of Europe, and particularly in France. In the universities of England, though the Aristotelian Physics had made an obstinate resistance, they had been sup¬ planted by the Cartesian, which became firmly established about the time when their founda¬ tion began to he sapped by the general progress of science, and particularly by the discoveries of Newton. For more than thirty years after the publication of those discoveries, the system of vortices kept its ground; and a translation from the French into Latin of the Physios of Rohault, a work entirely Cartesian, continued at Cambridge to he the text for philosophical in¬ struction. About the year 1718, a new and more elegant translation of the same book was published by Dr Samuel Clarke, with the addi¬ tion of notes, in which that profound and inge¬ nious writer explained the views of Newton on the principal objects of discussion; so that the notes contained virtually a refutation of the text: they did so, however, only virtually, all appear¬ ance of argument and controversy being care¬ fully avoided. Whether this escaped the notice of the learned Doctors or not, is uncertain; hut the new translation, from its better Latinity, and the name of the editor, was readily admit¬ ted to all the academical honours which the old one had enjoyed. Thus, the stratagem of Dr Clarke completely succeeded; the tutor might prelect from the text, hut the pupil would some¬ times look into the notes; and error is never so sure of being exposed as when the truth is placed close to it, side by side, without any thing to alarm prejudice, or awaken from its lethargy the dread of innovation.

"A Memoir of the Chevalier Louville, among those of the Academy of Sciences for 1720, is the first in that collection, and, I believe, the first published in France, where the elliptic mo¬ tion of the planets is supposed to he produced by the combination of two forces, one projectile and the other centripetal. Maupertuis soon after went much farther : in his elegant and philoso¬ phic treatise, Figure des Astres, published about 1730, he not only admitted the existence of at¬ traction as a fact, but even defended it, when considered as an universal property of body, against the reproach of being a metaphysical ab¬ surdity. These were considerable advances, but they were made slowly; and it was true, as Vol¬ taire afterwards remarked, that though the au¬ thor of the Principia survived the publication of that great work nearly forty years, he had not, at the time of his death, twenty followers out of England",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The principle of gravitation itself was con¬ sidered as difficult to be admitted. When pre¬ sented indeed as a mere fact, like the weight of bodies at the earth’s surface, or their tendency to fall to the ground, it was free from objection; and it was in this light only that Newton wish¬ ed it to be considered.2 But though this appears to be the sound and philosophical view of the subject, there has always appeared a strong de¬ sire in those who speculated concerning gravita¬ tion to go farther, and to inquire into the cause of what, as a mere fact, they were sufficiently disposed to admit. If you said that you had no explanation to give, and were only desirous of having the fact admitted, they alleged that this was an unsatisfactory proceeding,—that it was admitting the doctrine of occult causes,—that it amounted to the assertion, that bodies acted in places where they were not,—a proposition that, metaphysically considered, was undoubted- Th^ U""lveiT.ties Andrews and Edinburgh were, I believe, the first in Britain where the Newtonian nhilosonhi was made the subject of the academical prelections. For this distinction they are indebted to James and David Gregory the first in some respects the rival, but both the friends of Newton. Whiston bewails in the anguish of his heart the dif ference in this respect between those universities and his own. David Gregory taught in Edinburgh for several year prior to 1690 when he removed to Oxford ; and Whiston says, “ He had already caused several of his scholars to ^e acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian philosophy, while we at Cambridge (poor wretches) were J nomimousiy studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Cartesian.” (Whiston’s Memoirs of his own Life.)

"There were other arguments of a less abstruse nature, and more immediately connected with experiment, which, for a time, resisted the pro¬ gress of the Newtonian philosophy, though they contributed, in tbe end, very materially to its advancement. Nothing, indeed, is so hostile to the interests of truth, as facts inaccurately ob¬ served ; of which we have a remarkable example in the measurement of an arch of the meridian across France, from Amiens to Perpignan, though so large as to comprehend about seven degrees, and though executed by Cassini, one of the first astronomers in Europe. According to that measurement, the degrees seemed to dimi¬ nish on going from south to north, each being less by about an 800th part than that which im¬ mediately preceded it toward the south. From this result, which is entirely erroneous, the con¬ clusion first deduced was correct, the error in the reasoning, by a very singular coincidence, 1 Optics, query 21, at the end of the third book. . # . rp, 2 The passages quoted sufficiently prove that Newton did not consider gravity as a property inherent in mat er* e following passage in one of his letters to Dr Bentley is still more explicit: u It is inconceivable that inanimate ru e matter should, without the mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon and afreet other matter wi i- out mutual contact; as it must do, if gravitation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it... I hat gravi y should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of any thing else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.” (Newtoni Opera, tom. IV. p. 438. Horsley’s edit.) On this passage I cannot help remarking, that it is not quite clear in what manner the interposition of a material substance can convey the action of distant bodies to one another. In the case of percussion or pressure, this is indeed very intelligible, but it is by no means so m the case of at¬ traction. If two particles of matter, at opposite extremities of the diameter of the earth, attract one another, this effect is just as little intelligible, and the modus agendi is just as mysterious, on the supposition that the whole globe of the earth is interposed, as on that of nothing whatever being interposed, or of a complete vacuum existing between them. It is not enough that each particle attracts that in contact with it; it must attract the particles that are distant, and the interven¬ tion of particles between them does ndt rerider this at ail more intelligible","Amiens, Perpignan",FR,8,France,Europe
"The degrees growing less as they approached the pole, was an indication of the curvature growing greater, or of the longer axis of the meridian being the line that passed through the poles, and that coincided with the axis of the earth. The figure of the earth must, therefore, be that of an oblong spheroid, or one formed by the revolution of an ellipsis about its longer axis. This conclusion seemed to be strengthened by the prolongation of the meridian from Amiens northward to Dunkirk in 1713, as the same di¬ minution was observed; the medium length of the degree between Paris and Dunkirk being 56970 toises, no less than 137 less than the mean of the degrees toward the south.1 All this seemed quite inconsistent with the observations on the pendulum, as well as with the conclusions which Newton had deduced from the theory of gravity. The Academy of Sciences was thus greatly perplexed, and uncertain to what side to incline. In these circumstances, J. Cassini, whose errors were the cause of all the difficulty, had the merit of suggesting the only means by which the question concerning the figure of the earth was likely to receive a satisfactory solu¬ tion,—the measurement of two degrees, the one under the equator, and the other as near to the pole as the nature of the thing would admit","Amiens, Paris, Newton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

"stood by a few of his countrymen, but had to undergo the ordeal of a rigorous and sometimes unfriendly examination by foreigners. Averse from the bustle and contention of letteis, lie delighted to pursue his profound researches in perfect seclusion, and had appeared satisfied with registering the grand series of discoveries in that concentrated form which best accorded with the tone of his mighty intellect. When af¬ terwards persuaded reluctantly to publish those brief compositions, he could not submit to the drudgery of retracing his steps, or of expanding his demonstrations, and bringing them nearer the reach of his contemporaries. Newton was nine years in possession of the Method of Fluxions before Leibnitz struck into a similar path; nor did he give it to the world till an equal time more had elapsed. The rapid mind of the German philosopher had framed his Cal¬ culus with less regard to elegance and strict lo¬ gic, but clothed it in a simpler and more defi¬ nite notation or algorithm, which, from its apt¬ ness to improvement, has in the sequel confer¬ red a decided superiority. The diversified oc¬ cupations of Leibnitz allowed him to work only at intervals on his great invention ; but he found most able and zealous coadjutors in the two Bernoullis, who laboured in promoting the new calculus with uncommon ingenuity, indefati¬ gable activity, and even a contentious emula¬ tion. The Higher Analysis had by such exer¬ tions already acquired greater extension on the Continent than the Method of Fluxions at its first publication in England; and our mathema¬ ticians were hence unprepared to follow many of the abstruse and abbreviated demonstrations inserted in the Principia. The Differential and Integral Calculus having thus made such rapid advances abroad, continued for a long time af¬ terwards to maintain a preponderating ascend¬ ancy. The marks of the Fluxionary Method, consisting in mere dots, and therefore not sus¬ ceptible of variation or improvement, sensibly though indirectly checked the tide of invention in England ; and perhaps the splendour of New¬ ton’s fame had some influence for a season in overdazzling the lustre of native talent.

"693 continued to encourage philosophical pursuits; and now, hy directing the mensuration of the Meridian at the most distant points,—within the Arctic Circle, and under the Equator,—it pro¬ cured accurate data for determining the true figure of our Planet. It was the more precise measure of a degree of latitude ascertained hy Picard, that had at last enabled Newton to sub¬ ject to the test of calculation his grand idea of extending the power of gravitation from the earth’s surface, after the simplest law of de¬ crease, to the orbit of the moon. But the satis¬ faction was reserved for the successors of our immortal chief, to see his determination of the oblate form of the earth, arising from the mu¬ tual attraction of all its particles, modified by the influence of centrifugal force, fully confirm¬ ed by a close investigation of the results of the skilful and laborious observations brought home by the French astronomers. Nothing, indeed, contributed so much to exalt the character of the Newtonian Philosophy on the Continent as those scientific expeditions; while the credit of the system of Descartes, which bears no such scrutiny, rapidly declined. Mathematicians, in¬ vited to a rich field of discovery, were eager to examine the Principia through all its details; and the progress which the New Calculus had made, provided them with instruments for this dissection. The profound author had left in¬ deed several parts unfinished; of some of the more difficult problems he had merely sketched the solution; and he had commonly supplied the defects of his analytical procedure by the exer¬ cise of wonderful sagacity and penetration","Meridian, Newton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

But perhaps no writer contributed more effectually to pro¬ mote its diffusion and popular reception than Voltaire, whose universal talent ranged through the sphere of human knowledge, and whose easy and simple style gave transparency to his con¬ ceptions. The French, at length awakened from the Cartesian dreams, and directed into the path of inductive philosophy, again put forth their inventive powers. The fine genius of Clairaut and D’Alembert early soared to the highest dis¬ tinction in scientific research.

"The last of the three illustrious men who, by separate roads, arrived at the same conclusions, and thus concurred in fixing the true system of the world, was Leonard Euler, horn near Bale in Switzerland, and educated under the Ber- noullis, but who, patronised by foreign courts, passed a very long and most laborious life at St Petersburg and Berlin. He was indisputably the greatest analyst that has ever appeared, dis¬ playing infinite address, perspicuity, and ele¬ gance in his mode of investigation, and pursuing or transforming the most intricate calculations with such astonishing readiness and rapidity, as if they seemed only mere pastimes to recreate his invention. But the supremacy of Euler was confined to his unrivalled skill in applying ana¬ lysis ; he attained little eminence in philosophy and general science, and showed no relish for the charms of literature.

"Pure Geometry is in strictness limited to the mere equality of lines, angles, and spaces, whether superficial or solid. It owes its main extension to the principle of comparison or the doctrine of proportion, which is really but an application of Arithmetic, the idea of Number being transferred to Quantity or Magnitude by a process of subdivision. Such concert has pro¬ duced the most perfect of abstract sciences, and erected the noblest monument of the genius and invention of the ancient Greeks. That acute people nearly completed the Elements of Geo¬ metry; and carrying their speculations beyond the properties of the Circle, they investigated the Sections of the Cone, and traced the charac¬ ter of some of the Higher Curves. The demon¬ strations left by the Greek Geometers are models of accuracy, clearness, and elegance—admirably calculated for training the minds of youth to habits of close reasoning and luminous arrange¬ ment. The circumspection of those great instruc¬ tors of mankind in distinguishing the several cases, and marking the limitations of a proposi¬ tion, though frequently bordering on prolixity, might serve to warn the rapid cultivator of Alge¬ bra against indulging the tendency to hasty gene¬ ralization which has given rise to the various pa¬ radoxes, and even palpable absurdities, that still disfigure the excellence of the modern art. The method of Geometrical Analysis, which investi¬ gates the construction of a problem, by remount¬ ing from its conditions along a chain of depend¬ ence to some known property, affords decidedly the best exercise and initiatory discipline for the student in Mathematics. It imbues the mind with a taste and elegance which insensibly extend their influence over the culture of the other sci¬ ences. The most curious and difficult portion, however, of the Greek Geometry, has unfortu¬ nately been transmitted to us in a mutilated and imperfect state, which has often tortured the skill of commentators and mathematicians to restore it. Soon after the revival of letters, the principal works of the Greek Geometers were translated in Italy by Commandine; but of Apollonius’ Conics several books are wanting, and some parts of the Collections of Pappus ex¬ hibit only detached fragments. Near the close of the sixteenth century, and early in the seven¬ teenth, Vieta, from a few scattered hints, re¬ stored the lost Tract on Tangencies, Fermat framed some beautiful separate demonstrations, and Snellius reproduced the Plane Loci, but in a tasteless shape. Soon afterwards Viviani, the surviving disciple of Galileo, supplied the fifth book of Apollonius, and with such remarkable DISSERTATION FIFTH",,IT,8,Italy,Europe

"In 1684, having turned his attention to Kepler’s problem, he tried, as some other mathematicians about this time had done, to derive it from a graduating central force, but was unable to find a geometrical demonstration ; and not obtaining any help as he expected in this investigation from Hooke or Wren, he had recourse to Newton, who astonished him at Cam¬ bridge by the store of his grand discoveries, condensed into eight general propositions. He overcame the scruples of the modest philosopher, and prevailed with him to arrange the materials of the Principia, of which he superintended the pub¬ lication in 1687, having written the preface and some elegant recommendatory verses. Halley now gave a geometrical construction of the higher equations, computed the effects of evaporation in the IMediterranean, and formed tables of life annuities.

"longer preserved in Italy and in England than over the rest of Europe. But no person evei cultivated that fine science with more assiduity, perseverance, and success, than our countryman Dr Robert Simson1 of Glasgow, the learned and critical editor of Euclid’s Elements. In this department he concentrated his whole efforts, and appears, from his familiarity with the ancient mode of demonstration, to have inhaled the very spirit of the Greeks. In 1749, he published his Restoration of the books of Apollonius on Plane Loci, which by its fulness and peculiar elegance leaves scarcely a shadow of regret for the loss of the original. Simson pursued his researches in the Ancient Analysis through a long life, and not only restored various frag¬ ments, but threw light on some very difficult and abstruse questions connected with it. A posthumous volume, printed in 1776, at the ex¬ pence of Earl Stanhope, besides many fine geo¬ metrical speculations, contains the first satisfac¬ tory exposition of Porisms, of which the defini¬ tion advanced by Pappus had been commonly regarded as an incomprehensible enigma.

"Dr Matthew Stewart3 of Edinburgh, who had been the pupil of Dr Simson, and possessed a X Born at Kirtonhall in Ayrshire on 14th October 1687, studied at Glasgow, and made such progress in elementary geo¬ metry that at the early a""e of 22 he had an offer of the professorship of mathematics, which was immediately expected to be¬ come vacant in that University. Feeling his deficiency, however, he obtained leave of a year’s absence, which he spent in London under the tuition of Humphry Ditton, and was admitted to the chair on the 20th of November 1711. His time seems afterwards to have been mostly spent in discharging the duties of his office, the intervals being allotted to the solution of geometrical problems, the perusal of the older mathematicians, and to miscellaneous reading. He led the life of a recluse, and all his steps were formal and methodical; yet his disposition was amiable, and he indulged at stated times in easy conviviality. He sent two papers, geometrical and algebraical, on Indeterminate Problems, to the Royal Society m 1723 and 1753, gave his restoration of the Loci Plani in 1745, published his Conic Sections in 1735, produced the Latin edition of Euclid’s Elements in a quarto volume in 1756, which he compressed in 1760 into an English octavo, to which he annexed the data in 1762. It contains only the first six books of the original, with the eleventh and twelfth, the rest of the books being omitted as of little consequence in the present state of science. Perhaps the selection should have been carried far¬ ther. This edition is correct and creditable to the compiler, and has obtained prodigious success. -^'ay5 6ie veiy Scotti¬ cisms with which it abounds appear now to be adopted at Oxford and Cambridge as the appropiiate diction of the Ancient Geometry. Simson quite idolized his original. He had a fine taste for geometry, some talents of invention, and consider¬ able attainments as a scholar, but without any great force of intellect. In his latter years, from excessive veneration of the Greek Geometry, he not only viewed the Cartesian method with aversion, but began to regard the I luxionary Calculus with mistrust and suspicion.

"2 Born in 1717 at Rothsay, in the Isle of Bute, of which place his father was minister ; studied seven years at Glasgow, where he distinguished himself; to gain farther instruction, in 1741 he removed to Edinburgh, wheie he cultivated the society of the celebrated Maclaurin, while he corresponded with Simson, his old master. He now prosecuted geometrical studies with ardour, and put forth his uncommon powers of invention ; and after he became minister at Roseneath, he found leisure in that seclusion to continue his favourite pursuits. On the occasion of a vacancy of the mathematical chair at Edin¬ burgh by the death of Maclaurin, he was induced to draw out the substance of his most profound geometrical investigations, which he printed under the title of General Theorems, in a small volume, about the close of 1746. This publication se¬ cured his election, and after some delay he was appointed professor in September 1747- He now enjoyed a situation most congenial to his taste, and favourable to the exercise of his rare talents. Ambitious to apply his beloved geometry to un¬ ravel questions which were believed to demand all the resources of algebraic art, he discovered a solution of Kepler s pro¬ blem at once simple and direct, and greatly surpassing in beauty the more laboured efforts of calculation. . This investi¬ gation was inserted in the second volume of the Transactions of the Edinburgh Society, which appeared in 1/56. En¬ couraged by such success, he five years afterwards produced his Physical and Mathematical Tracts ; a very ingenious and elegant work, which would have been clearer had the author only admitted an abbreviation by the simpler algebraic symbols. About this time the results of the observations of the Transit of Venus, which had been expected to give the true distance of the Sun, were found to be unsatisfactory and discordant. Stewart therefore published in 1763, as a sequel to his Tracts, a theoretical solution of the problem; in which he was directed by Geometry to the exact motion of the Lunar Apogee, a question that, since the analysis of Newton, had perplexed the greatest mathematicians. . But he was not equally felicitous in Determining the Solar Distance, which required the inversion of the problem, and involved some deceitful and precarious compensations of error. This pamphlet was his last production, having printed only a few months before an octavo volume under the title of Propositiones More Veterum Demonstrates. These propositions^ however, derive their value merely as exercises of the method of conducting geometrical analysis and synthesis. But his lamp of genius was already nearly extinguished. Dr Stewart fell into a state of bad health, and having devolved the charge of teaching on his son, then a youth of the highest promise, he retired in 1772 to a small paternal property in Ayrshire, w here he chiefly spent the rest of his days, and died on the 23d of January 1785","Born, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newton","GB,NL,US",8,"United Kingdom,Netherlands,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"It would seem that, in finding the square root, the Greek mathematicians must have employed certain methods of abbreviation which are not explained. Archimedes, in his famous Quadra¬ ture of the Circle, to which he approximated by measuring the successive inscribed and circum¬ scribing polygons, having occasion repeatedly to extract the square root, expressed the value by fractions, and yet with such felicity as always to adopt the lowest integral numerator and de¬ nominator. He thus discovered that the cir¬ cumference of a circle is less than 3} times and greater than 3^ times its diameter, or that their ratio lies between the ratios 7 to 22 and of 71 to 223.1 This approximation within the limits of the 2000th and 4000th parts, might be suffi¬ cient for ordinary practice. But Apollonius and Ptolemy afterwards approached a hundred times nearer. Yet no farther advances were made in solving that important problem, which re¬ quired the most refined address, till the lapse of near a thousand years, when the Arabians be¬ came possessed of the denary system of notation, and carried the expression for the circumference of a circle to ten decimal places. But this elabo¬ rate result was imperfectly known to the revi¬ vers of science in Europe ; and Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and others, exerted their ingenuity and patience in extending the earlier solution. The simplest and most elegant is that of 113 to 355, an approximation differing scarcely by the ten millionth part from the truth, which was disco¬ vered about the year 1585 by the elder Adrian Metius, a military engineer in Holland. His countrymen Van Keulen and Snellius, in the next century, pushed the expression for the cir¬ cumference of the circle to 35 figures. But the progress of the higher analysis opened more easy and rapid modes of approximation. In the early part of the eighteenth century, Sharp2 and Ma- 1 This ratio, it may be observed, is easily derived from the limits assigned bv Archimedes, for 71 + 7x 6 = 113, and 223 + 22x6 = 355","Adrian, Holland","US,GR",8,"United States,Greece","North America,Europe"

"chin1 computed in England the quadrature of the circle to 75 and 100 places of decimals, and Lagny in France advanced to 128 figures. But these labours were outdone hy Vega,2 an officer of artillery in the Austrian service, who amused his leisure during a campaign, in employing one of Euler’s formulae to derive the length of a quadrant from the tangents of fractional arcs, carried the expression to 140 decimal places. This was the luxury of calculation; and though no doubt superfluous, it might at least convince any judicious person of the impossibility of stating the ratio of the diame¬ ter to the circumference in finite terms. Yet the squaring of the circle is a problem which has at all times fascinated the attention and bewildered the reason of many superficial or an¬ tiquated students in Geometry. The incom¬ mensurability of the circle, which James Gre¬ gory had attempted to prove in 1661, was finally demonstrated a century afterwards by Lam¬ bert, from an ingenious transformation of the known series for the quadrantal arc in terms of its tangent or the radius. The same inge¬ nious mathematician likewise proposed several neat geometrical constructions, for approximat¬ ing to the length of arcs of a circle still more nearly than the methods given by Fermat, Gre¬ gory, Huygens, and others",,"FR,AT",8,"France,Austria","Europe,Europe"
"3 It may be sufficient perhaps to notice the Elements of Geometry by Thomas Simpson, and the similar treatises in the French language by Clairaut and Legendre. These productions all unite clearness with precision ; and excluding whatever appears superfluous, they still comprise the whole series of connected propositions. Simpson’s unpretending volume is neat and very brief, yet sufficiently perspicuous. The Geometry of Clairaut is still shorter, but has an air of originality, being designed to show the road of induction, or to guide the learner through his efforts at the solution of geometric problems, to discover the great elementary truths. He followed the same plan, and with more complete success, in his excellent Elements of Algebra. But the Geometry by Legendre claims much higher merit, and is perhaps the best on the whole that has yet appeared. It were vain, however, to expect perfection: the steps of his demonstrations are sometimes incom¬ plete, and his entire separation of the problems is at least a very questionable improvement. I he notes he has added are valuable, but appear disproportioned to the text, and certainly too profound for beginners.

"701 remarkable propositions, derived from sources beyond the usual scope of Geometry, are yet as¬ similated with that science. Of such accessions, one of the most beautiful is the late curious and unexpected discovery of Gauss, that, besides the ordinary regular polygons, a numerous class more complex, including the next polygon of seventeen sides, are capable of being inscribed within a circle, by a mere geometrical construc¬ tion. 1 In solving the common problems, the straight line and the circle are generally combined, which requires the application of both the ruler and the compasses. Schooten effected by the ruler alone several simple constructions, of use parti¬ cularly in castrametation. But the late Masche- roni2 of Bergamo, in a small work which appear¬ ed in 1795, made a beautiful addition to Ele¬ mentary Geometry, by the solution of a variety of problems, especially those concerning the in¬ scription of the regular polygons, with the help exclusively of compasses.

"The discovery of the Denary Notation, so beau¬ tiful and simple in its application, is commonly referred to India, though neither the place nor the date of its origin has been ascertained. It was unknown to the Arabian astronomers till near the close of the eleventh century of our era, and even at this period its expressions appear sometimes intermingled with the alphabetic nu¬ merals. But the advantages of the system were soon perceived; and the Tables of Sines and Tangents calculated by those laborious mathe¬ maticians are now found, from examination of the manuscripts belonging to the University of Leyden, to be correct to the tenth decimal figure. The Arabians transmitted the new sys¬ tem ot notation to the flourishing colony of their countrymen in Spain, whence it was slow¬ ly communicated to the several Christian States over Europe. This change was effected chiefly by the calendars or perpetual almanacs com¬ piled in the Moorish seminaries, and eagerly pur¬ chased by the various monasteries and convents throughout Christendom. Yet the Arabic ciphers appear to have remained unknown in every part of Europe beyond Spain, before the middle of the fourteenth century; nor in mercantile transac¬ tions were they commonly adopted till near two centuries later. It is a singular circumstance that the advantages of employing the descending progression in the nicer calculations were not sooner perceived, especially after the use which Ptolemy had made of sexagesimals. Stevinus was the first who distinctly introduced the prac¬ tice of decimal fractions in 1585, though Regio¬ montanus had made a great step towards that improvement, which Ramus even indirectly em¬ ployed. To count downwards might seem as easy as to reckon upwards.

"The formation of Magic Squares, by which the numbers in their natural order are disposed in cells, so that each column gives an equal sum, remounts to high antiquity. They have been regarded in the east as charms or talismans, of great potency in the tide of human affairs. The digital squares from 3 to 9 were dedicated to the seven stars, including the sun and moon, which in the astrological visions were believed to rule the successive days of the week.3 The people of Siam had learned a very simple method of filling up those squares; but some European Mathematicians have since amused themselves with such arithmetical curiosities. Stifels, in his Arithmetica Integra, incidentally treated of Ma¬ gic Squares, yet without naming them. He was immediately followed in a small arithmetical treatise by Adam Riese; but the French seem to have directed most attention to those scienti¬ fic recreations. From the latter part of the 17th till beyond the middle of the 18th century, a succession of ingenious persons were at pains to improve and extend the construction.

"It is a singular fact, that though Continued Fractions had their origin in this island, they were afterwards almost wholly overlooked by our mathematicians. Scarcely thirty years have passed away since the attention of the curious was again recalled to them. But an acquaintance with the transformation of those fractions would prove extremely useful to practical men, by fur¬ nishing a variety of short approximations, which are easily remembered and readily applied. Or¬ dinary computations in mensuration, in the com¬ parison of different weights and measures, and in several standard proportions, might thus be much abbreviated without any sensible inaccu¬ racy. The method proposed by Lambert for decomposing fractions into progressions that have their denominators formed by successive multipliers, could be employed in a similar way; but its application is somewhat difficult and in¬ tricate.3 To facilitate the operations of arithmetic, tables have been digested of the powers and products of numbers. The most astonishing work of that kind, including all the multipliers from one to one thousand, was produced by Hervart, Chancellor of Bavaria, in 1610, only four years before the invention of Logarithms, the want of which it could in some faint degree have supplied. But tables of products in a less unwieldy shape are still occasionally used for abridging the labour of calculation. A notable improvement has been lately introduced by the substitution of Quarter Squares, grounded on the known property that the product of any two numbers is equal to the fourth part of the ex¬ cess of the square of their sum above the square of their difference. A single page might com¬ prise as many of those numbers as, by simple addition and subtraction, would exhibit an ex¬ tent of products equal to those contained in Hervart’s enormous folio.4 It would be a great improvement in elemen¬ tary education to introduce into the schools a more extended multiplication table, including at least all the products of the numbers from 1 to 25. A very useful practice has been adopted lately in the north of Germany, to accustom learners to the readiness of mental calcula¬ tion.5 1 The area of a circle having unit for its diameter is expressed by the alternating series 1 — h + l — } + i, &c. which was converted by Euler into the continued fraction 1 T + 2+9^ ¥ + 25 ¥ + 49 2 + &c., the numerators being the squares of the odd numbers. This extension never stops, and consequently the fraction is not reducible to finite terms, the square of the expression runs into a similar infinitude. _ 2 It deserves to be mentioned that Girard first gave the simple recurring series which expresses the parts of a line di¬ vided into extreme and mean ratio. It is formed by the continued addition of the two preceding terms. Ihus 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, &c. The square of each number in this series differs from the product of the two numbers which inclose it, only by unit alternately in excess and defect: Thus 82 = 64 = 5 x 13 — 1, 132 = 169 = 8 x 21 + 1",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"Each step of an investigation being now regis¬ tered in the clearest and most precise manner, the mind is relieved from the fatigue of carrying forward the whole of a continuous chain of rea¬ soning. It can rest at any placed and again re¬ sume the process of deduction with the greatest facility. But this perfection of pictured lan¬ guage has been the result of a series of slow and successive improvements. Diophantus, who, soon after the Christian era, composed a large treatise on the resolution of certain arithmetical problems, a portion of which work is preserved, made the first attempt towards an abbreviated form of analysis. The symbols he used were, however, exceedingly few, being the initials or terminations of the ordinary words, only some¬ what modified. It deserves remark, that Dio¬ phantus viewing a number as composed from another by the addition or subtraction of a third, he termed this last one abundant or de¬ ficient, and gave a rule for the multiplication of those affected numbers, similar to what is now applied to the signs plus and minus. His treatise passed into the hands of the Arabians, who studied the numerical properties with much ardour, hut made no advances in refining or simplifying the form of notation. From them again this higher species of arithmetic was transplanted into Italy, probably during the fourteenth century, by Leonard, a merchant of Pisa, who had travelled long in the East",Pisa,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"A series of works on Arithmetic and Geome¬ try were published between the years 1470 and 1487 by Pacciolo, a Minorite Friar, who in 1494 brought out his Arte Maygiore, or what he says was vulgarly called the Ilegola de la Cosa, or Alghebra and Almucabala. the first ap¬ pellation derived from the Italian Cosa, denot¬ ing the Thing sought, and the other borrowed from the Arabic words expressing Resolution and Composition. After the appearance of this ele¬ mentary digest, Algebra was cultivated in Italy, during the first half of the sixteenth century, with great industry and success. Ferreo, Tar- talea, and especially Cardan, made rapid ad¬ vances in the new science. This ingenious though very singular person not only gave the solution of Cubic Equations which hears his name, but discovered the leading properties of equations in general, distinguishing their roots into the true and the fictitious ; and besides im¬ proved the notation by employing frequently the letters of the alphabet. The Italians, however, still used contracted words for symbols, and the initials p. and m. for the signs of plus and minus. In 1572, Bombelli of Bologna, retaining this embarrassed mode of writing, composed a regular summary of Algebra, which he enriched with Ferrari’s rule for resolving biquadratic equations. In the meanwhile the knowledge of the analytic art had penetrated into Germany, where it received its capital improvement in no¬ tation from the systematic genius of that people",Bologna,"IT,DE",8,"Italy,Germany","Europe,Europe"
"The change was chiefly effected by the industry of Stifels,1 a Protestant minister and zealous follower of Luther, who in 1544 published his Arithmetica Integra. In that remarkable work he first introduced the symbols -f and — for plus and minus, and the character A (or a con¬ tracted R) for Radix or root; and he repre¬ sented unknown quantities by the capital let¬ ters A, B, C, &c. and intimated the successive powers and their reciprocals by an ascending and descending series of exponents. Nor was his merit confined to algebraic writing: the en- 1 Born at Eslingen, in Saxony, in 1509, and died at Jena in 1567- Though a profound and inventive mathematician, he seems to have imbibed all the wild enthusiasm of that convulsed period. Captivated perhaps by the wonderful properties of numbers, he fancied, as other ingenious persons have since done, that he could interpret the visions of the Apocalypse, and foretell the end of the world. He was so imprudent as to place that awful dissolution very near hand. Early in the morning of the day predicted in the year 1553, he assembled his trembling flock in a wide open field, where he endeavoured to season their minds for the tremendous change by fervid prayers and pathetic exhortations. The sky was lowering, the darkness thickened, a portentous silence prevailed, and the preacher rolled his thunders with overpowering energy. But the.clouds soon passed away, the sun shone forth in his wonted splendour, and all nature smiled.

"tlmsiasm of the age seems to have roused the spirit of invention in him; and Stifels anti¬ cipated some of the later discoveries, pointed out the nature of Logarithms, explained the pro¬ perties of figurate numbers, and showed how the co-efficients of the powers of a binomial quantity may be derived from the columns of what has been since called the arithmetical tri¬ angle. Scheubel a few years afterwards pursued the same path, yet without adding any thing material to the science. In this state it made its way at last into England, where Recordej1 an ingenious though unfortunate man, printed the Cossic Art at London in 1553.

"In the meanwhile France continued the pur¬ suit of the mathematical sciences. Ramus had revived those abstract studies; but Vieta, who succeeded him, and flourished between the years 1570 and 1600, rose by his numerous discoveries to much higher eminence; a lawyer by pro¬ fession, yet a man of great learning, and gifted with profound and original genius, conjoined with the most indefatigable application. Yieta introduced the literal or specious Algebra, and thus rendered its procedure quite general, by employing the Roman capitals always to denote numbers, the vowels being appropriated to un¬ known quantities. He likewise traced vari¬ ous distinctions, and framed several significant terms, which are still retained. But while he improved the analytical symbols, he greatly ex¬ tended the theory of equations, and cultivated with success the prolific and important subject of angular sections",Roman,"FR,RO",8,"France,Romania","Europe,Europe"

He afterwards im¬ proved the solutions of cubic and biquadratic equations, and illustrated the methods of approximating to the resolution of equations in general. But the most important service he rendered to mathematical science consists in reprinting at great expence, and chiefly for distribution, the series of original authors in logarithms, with ample annotations, in six large quarto volumes. From his anxiety to be perspicuous, he was apt to fall into the opposite extreme of tiresome prolixity.' The grandfather of Maseres was an officer in the French guards, born in the district of Bearn, and a Hugonot, who, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, retired to Holland, and transferring his services to the Prince of Orange, accompa¬ nied the Preserver of our liberties into England, and fought by his side in Ireland. The grandson having embraced the profession of the law, was soon after the peace of 1763, probably on account of his intimate acquaintance with French lan¬ guage and customs, appointed Attorney General of Quebec, where he resided till 1770. At leaving his charge, he visited Boston and New York, while that agitation was fermenting which burst into open revolt. Soon after his return to Eng¬ land, he published in successive volumes his Canadian Free/iolder, in which he refuted the despotic maxims of Lord Mans¬ field, and earnestly recommended conciliatory measures with our American colonies. But it was a time of infatuation and disaster. Maseres by his firmness gave mortal offence to the courtiers, and never obtained any promotion, farther than the small sinecure office of Cursitor Baron of Exchequer. But fortune had abundantly provided for all his wants, and he enjoyed unbroken health, and the renovating pleasures of study and social intercourse. The Baron had composed a full and learned treatise on Life Annuities, and matured a plan for securing small pensions from Government to such of the poorer classes as should make certain contributions during the vigour of their days. This he embodied in a Bill which passed the Commons, but was lost in the House of Lords, through the influence of the Bishops, who seem to have consi¬ dered pauperism as a right appendage to their splendid ecclesiastic establishment.

In 1730, he published an original work, which, besides other useful in¬ ventions, explained the properties of a Recurring Series, that always repeats the same succession of co-efficients in distinct sequences. About the same time, Stirling3 brought out a complete treatise on Series, in which he advanced by a different road to consider their convergence, in¬ terpolation, and summation.

Having shown an early taste for Mathematics, he continued to prosecute the study as a profession. He supported himself creditably in exile, by giving lessons and reading public lectures. His analytical discoveries extended his fame, and his good conduct insured him respect. He embraced the Newtonian Philosophy, and made some improvements on it. He generalized Cotes’ famous theorem of the section of a circle, but turned his attention chiefly to the method of series, which he applied successfully to the doctrine of annuities and chances. After his reputation for such calculations had been established, it is said that he spent a great part of the day at Slaughter’s Coffee-House, in St Martin’s Lane, where he was ready to answer any question of ""that nature pro¬ pounded to him, for the fee of one guinea. His principal work on the Doctrine of Chances was published in 1738, but the en¬ larged and improved edition bears date 1756.

He then repaired to London, and becoming acquainted with the Venetian Minister, he accepted an invitation to settle at Venice, where he resided several years, and taught Mathematics.

"The latest improvement that Algebra has received consists in the Combinatovial Analysis^ which may he viewed as an important extension of the principles of the binomial theorem. Vieta traced the rudiments of the doctrine, which was successively enlarged by Mersenne, Guldinus, Schooten, Pascal, Wallis, James Bernoulli, De Moivre, and Euler. But it has received its greatest expansion in Germany, and chiefly from the laborious and persevering researches of Hindenburg, who first published a tract on this subject in 1779, and resumed the discussion in the years 1793, 1794, and 1795. He was followed in the same line of investigation by Burckhardt, Rothe, De Prassi, and Pfaff; and this interesting branch of analysis now forms a part of the algebraical course pursued in the Ger¬ man States.

This im¬ portant branch of Analysis has continued to he much cultivated in Germany, under the more expressive name of Goniometry, which was first applied by Lagny in the Parisian Transac¬ tions for 1724, to an ingenious method proposed by him for measuring angles.1 Pfaff has lately enlarged it with the properties of the multiple tangents, and his countryman Mollweide has likewise made some valuable additions. The store of formula now collected is of the utmost utility in transforming and reducing into prac¬ tical operation the different series adopted by Physical Astronomy.* Algebra has also been applied with advantage to Goniometry generally, as comprehending the so- 1 ution of the cases both in Plane and Spherical Tri¬ gonometry. This was early attempted by Girard, but carried to its completion by Euler and La¬ grange. Some concise and elegant formulae have been deduced, which facilitate and diversify the practice of computation. In short, if Algebra were purged of the vitious language and inaccu¬ rate conceptions that pervade it, and which were early introduced by the confidence of rapid and careless calculators, it might at last claim the character of a perfect science",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"The number of elementary treatises of Algebra which have been produced in various languages during the currency of the eighteenth century, appears quite incredible. They are almost ephe¬ meral, and assume every feature and dimension, superficial or profound, from the size of a primer to the magnitude of a lexicon. A very few of those works claim the highest praise, and may retain their hold of education. The Algebra of Euler is in various respects a most remark¬ able production.

"To obtain the differential of any integral ex¬ pression, is always practicable; the great diffi¬ culty consists in reversing the problem, and find¬ ing the integral which corresponds to a given differential equation. Such equation must be rendered complete before the integration is ef¬ fected. It was hence a question of much im¬ portance, to save unavailing efforts, by deter¬ mining the conditions necessarily required for integration. Euler, as usual, was the first to discover the rule in 1736; but, only three years afterwards, it was without any communication produced by Fontaine and Clairaut.

"Of this fine theory, the first trace was shown by the rapid genius of Leibnitz, in his mode of dif¬ ferentiating a curve whose equation itself is sup¬ posed to undergo the minutest alteration. The controversies of the Bernoullis concerning Isope¬ rimeters and Lines of the Swiftest Descent, aug¬ mented greatly the various resources of that kind of Analysis. But Euler, combining their dis¬ coveries, produced a new and direct mode of find¬ ing such Maxima and Minima, and compressed the solutions into a systematic form, in a distinct treatise published at Lausanne in 1744. This elaborate performance led the way for the simp¬ ler and most elegant and comprehensive doctrine created by the early genius of Lagrange, and invested by him with a commodious notation; Euler, who was far superior to any feeling oi jealousy, readily embraced this improvement, and bestowed on it the denomination of the Cal¬ culus of Variations, of which he explained the principles and application, after the most com¬ plete manner, in a tract appended to the third volume of his great work. The distinction be¬ tween Differentials and Variations is rather subtle, yet may be easily conceived by consid¬ ering the nature of the Parabola. When an ordinate shifts into a proximate position, both it and the corresponding absciss acquire Differ¬ entials ; but if the Parameter suffer the minut¬ est alteration, the whole trace of the curve will vary, and the infinitesimal mutation which the ordinate thence undergoes is termed its Varia¬ tion. The algorithm adopted to denote Varia¬ tions consists of the Greek letters instead of the Roman or Italic, which have been appropriated to the ordinary Differentials.

"The method of Analytical or Derivative Func¬ tions, which has since acquired such celebrity, was darkly anticipated by Dr Waring, one of the profoundest but most obscure of algebraical writers. This elegant theory was concisely sketched by Lagrange in 1772, and enlarged thirty years afterwards into a distinct work ; the same subject having been Heated very fully and somewhat differently by Arbogast in 1800. It is grounded chiefly on the inversion of Taylor’s theorem, the co-efficients of the several terms of a Derived or Expanded Function involving the successive orders of its Differentials. But La¬ grange deduces the formula from considerations purely analytical, and endeavours thence to erect a science on strict logical principles, entirely disengaged from ideas of Infinitesimals or of Vanishing Ratios. It may however be doubt¬ ed whether, with all his ingenuity, he has at¬ tained that object, or gained, indeed, any real advantage. A mathematician so deeply imbued as that sublime genius with the spirit of calcu¬ lation, would almost spontaneously regard a pro¬ cess of analysis in the same light as a train of legitimate reasoning. However satisfactory may seem the origin of Derivative Functions, if we examine it closely, we shall probably find the demonstration to rest merely on the strength of analogy, which surely is not the most conclusive sort of argument.

He now travelled into France, and spent some time at the country-seat of the Marquis de I’Hopital, whom he taught the New Calculus. Proceeding next to Holland, he was appointed in 1695 Professor of Medicine and Mathematics (for these sciences were strangely conjoined) in the University of Groningen. The fame he there acquired by his lectures and writings appears to have awakened the jealousy or bigotry of the Calvinistic clergy, who brought a serious charge against him, for impugning the doctrine of the resurrection in a Thesis maintained by one of his scholars, and composed or corrected bv himself, which represented the body as in a state of continual mutation, not only the liquid, but even the solid parts being successively absorbed and renewed, and no particle of the composition remaining after a very short term of years.

"The slightest incident has often led to the most interesting discoveries. Few would sup¬ pose that the spinning of a common top in¬ volves the most diflicult conditions in Dyna¬ mics, and serves to explain all the intricacies of the planetary vertiginous motions. Segner, a celebrated professor of mathematics at Got¬ tingen, and afterwards at Halle, and a man of original and independent mind, published, in 1755, a short dissertation, with the modest title of Specimen Theorice Turbinum, wherein he show¬ ed that every body having a determinate figure, which after combined impulsions is abandoned in free space, will, besides its progressive mo¬ tion, perform simultaneously, and without the smallest interference, a constant and uniform re¬ volution about each of three principal axes mu¬ tually perpendicular, and passing through the centre of gravity. These axes of rotation possess some beautiful but abstruse properties, which the pulse of native genius burst through constraint, and hurried him into the ardent pursuit of geometry and astronomy, which he cultivated in private. Alluding to this circumstance, he chose for his device Phaethon driving the chariot of the Sun, with the motto, “ Invito patre sidera verso."" He began his travels for information in 1676, visited Geneva, traversed France, and eagerly sought the society of men of learning and science. In 1680 he descended to the Netherlands and Hol¬ land, passed over to F.ngland, and frequented the philosophical meetings in London. .After his return home m 1632, he gave a course of mechanical lectures, in which he exhibited the new discoveries. Being appointed Professor of Mathe¬ matics in 1687, the fame of his vast attainments drew crowds of strangers to the academy. His genius was a torch of illu¬ mination, and the most elegant simplicity distinguished all his profound inventions. In conjunction with his younger bro¬ ther, he not onlv found out the secret of the Differential Calculus, on which Leibnitz had given a very short and obscure essay in the Leipsic Acts, but unfolded the principles with such superior talent and address, that the German philosopher had the generosity to regard him as entitled to share in the honour of the great discovery. He pursued the Aew Calculus with extreme ardour, and applied it most happily to a variety of arduous investigations: He greatly improved the Method of Series, extended the Theory of Curve Lines, approximated to the rectification of the Parabola, and discovered man% beautiful properties of cycloids, epicycloids, and spirals. With the logarithmic spiral, which he discovered to renovate itself by evolution, his fancy was so much struck, that, in imitation of Archimedes, but in allusion to the sublime prospect of resurrection, when he should “ shuffle off this mortal coil,” and rise like Phoenix from her ashes, he directed with a fine enthusiasm this curve to be inscribed on his tomb, with the Ovidian line, “ Eadem mutata resurgo. . , But such nrightv strides required proportional exertion of intellect, and this intense and unremitting applrcatron under¬ mined the constitution of Bernoulli, and carried him to a premature grave.

Such was the progress he made, that he was admitted, at the age of 24, a member of the Academy of Sciences, and two years afterwards he produced his 1 realise on Dynamics. The germs of the Calculus of Partial Differences appeared in his Dissertation on Winds, which obtained the prize from the Academy of Berlin in 1746.

But he now sought to distinguish himself likewise in philosophy and literature, and pub¬ lished a variety of tracts, which gave occasion to controversy and violent opposition. But this hostility carried his reputa tion to a higher pitch. He corresponded with the great Frederick of Prussia, but refused the flattering offers of that Mo¬ narch and of the Empress Catharine of Russia. The literary honours he enjoyed at home were more agreeable to bis taste. Having become secretary to both Academies, he was esteemed the head of the philosophical body at Paris.

But this was not admitted at the time in its full extent, the noted experiment of the Florentine Acade¬ micians seeming to have established the abso¬ lute incompressibility of water. The conclusion however was too hastily drawn; for though the liquid included within a hollow sphere of gold resisted the blows of a hammer, and burst the shell, yet the celerity with which it spirted through the crevice, only displayed the elastic force resulting, as Bellegradi rightly observed, from an expansive effort to recover its previous condition.

Still the popular and ele¬ mentary treatises, neglecting such decisive facts, continued to repeat with complacency the para¬ doxical assertion, that water retains the same volume under every degree of compression.

"1 John Canton, one of our most diligent, skilful, and accurate experimental philosophers, was born at Stroud in Glou¬ cestershire in 1718- His father, a broad-cloth weaver, bred him to the same trade; but the youth, incited by the lessons of an elementary teacher, had from his earliest years imbibed a taste for mathematical studies, and continued to devote every leisure moment to those fascinating pursuits. The ingenuity he showed in constructing sun-dials drew the notice of his more intelligent neighbours, who kindly fostered his efforts, and lent him instructive books. Nothing has contributed more in England, not only to spread general information, but to awaken latent genius, than the circulation of popular com- pendiums and dictionaries of science. With these aids the ardent application of Canton made such rapid and striking pro¬ gress, that his patrons counselled him to quit the loom and repair to the metropolis, the great mart of talent. In 1738 he was admitted assistant in a mathematical school in Spital Square, and afterwards became partner and successor in the con¬ cern, which he conducted during the rest of his life. Without aspiring to the higher walks of science, he was active in the search of knowledge.

"735 glomeration of thunder-clouds to the prime con¬ ductor of an electrical machine. Winkler next, and with more decided arguments, contended for the identity of those powers. Franklin, following the same train of speculation, enumerated in a clear and methodical order the different circum¬ stances of resemblance. But it was necessary to pass the circle of mere probabilities, and he pro¬ posed as the final proof to have recourse to direct observation. His suggestion wTas, to erect on the top of some eminence a tapering iron rod 40 feet high, which he conceived would attract electricity from the charged thunder-clouds. Preparations were accordingly made in France for trying that bold experiment. In the spring of 1752, Dali- bard, a distinguished botanist, had an iron rod 40 feet in height tied with silk cords to a post in the neighbourhood of Paris, the lower end being pro¬ tected from rain by a sort of sentry-box. The ap¬ paratus was, during his absence, intrusted to the charge of a resolute carpenter, who watching the first appearance of a thunder-storm on the 10th of May, ran to the spot, drew sparks from the rod, and, assisted by the curate of the vil¬ lage, actually charged an electric jar. The demonstration of the nature of Lightning was thus rendered complete; but an experiment so wonderful deserved repetition. It was eagerly performed, under the direction of Buffon, in the Royal Garden at Paris ; and, during the months of July and August, it was tried with the same results near London, where Canton succeeded in detecting atmospheric electricity by means of a common fishing-rod","Franklin, Paris, Paris, London, Canton","US,FR,GB",8,"United States,France,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"
"These views, combined with amusing experi¬ ments and lively speculations, were explained at great length, and in a very easy and pleasing manner, in the series of letters to Collinson, and through his friendship printed at London in 1755, and immediately translated into the French language, and circulated with zeal and rapidity over Europe.1 Notwithstanding the enthusiasm excited by the dispersion of that work, the scheme of an¬ nexing conductors to buildings was yet slowly adopted. The first one erected was by Watson, at his villa near London, in 1762; two years afterwards, they appeared in Germany; and not till the year 1776 wrere they applied to pro¬ tect some cathedrals in Bavaria and Italy","London, London","GB,DE,IT,FR",8,"United Kingdom,Germany,Italy,France","Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"But though any attempt to avert the course of thunder seem preposterous, it is of extreme importance to consider whether the intervention of a proper conductor may not mitigate, or even render innocuous, the fulminating stroke. The coruscation of lightning resembles most the electric spark, its tortuous path being marked by the violent divulsion of the aerial track. The rapidity of transit might indeed be regarded as instantaneous; but Helvig has lately endea¬ voured, in Germany, to measure it by help of the Camera Lucida, and estimates it, from probable conjecture, at 8 or 10 miles in a second, or above 40 times swifter than sound. According to the ingenious Gay-Lussac, lightning often darts at once more than three miles in a rectilineal path",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"Iron, which is generally employed, conducts twenty times slower than copper; and lead is still worse adapted for the purpose, since it conducts about a hundred times slower. The electrical energy being conveyed chiefly along the surface of bodies, sheet-copper should decidedly be pre¬ ferred for the substance of a conductor.1 Thunder-rods of the ordinary construction have been now tried seventy years, and the accidents from lightning seem just as numerous and in¬ discriminate as before. The public is gradually losing its confidence, therefore, in the efficacy of those vaunted protectors; but, in spite of such warnings, philosophers are most unwilling to descend from their proud eminence. When any sinister event occurs, they are solicitous to find excuses and parry objections. They recommend the conductors to be planted nearer, carried higher, and perhaps armed with a cluster of points. It may require a few more of such fa¬ tal accidents as the late explosion, in France, of a protected powder-magazine, to demolish finally the Franklinian hypothesis",,FR,8,France,Europe
"737 About the year 1776, several speculative expe¬ rimenters, conceiving electricity promoted con¬ gelation, and therefore the conversion of the drops of rain into solid icicles, proposed erect¬ ing thunder-rods to prevent the formation of hail. It was even suggested, in aid of those pro¬ tectors, to kindle fires on the high grounds, and to shake the atmosphere by the discharge of mortars. But Heinich showed the futility of all such expedients, in a dissertation printed in the Bavarian Transactions for 1785; and, except the notice of a curious experiment by Seiferheld in 1790, the question seems to have sunk into oblivion. The attention of the public, however, was again for a moment recalled in 1800, by the offer of a prize from the Physical Society at Berlin; but the successful candidates, Wrede and Weiss, proved that hailstones had no con¬ nexion with Electricity, and that the various expedients tried for averting them were entirely fallacious. The subject seemed deservedly for¬ gotten for twenty years, but has been lately re¬ vived again by the periodical folly of mankind",Berlin,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"La Postolle, apparently a zealous visionary, pro¬ posed in France with the utmost confidence, as a complete safeguard against the ravages of hail, the erection of a tall wooden pole with straw ropes hanging loosely from the top of it to the ground. He was followed in 1823 by Thollard, another projector equally sanguine. But as the world is governed by names, the powerful talis¬ man or lofty thatched pole received the sound¬ ing, though not very classical, appellation of Paragrele or Paragrandino. Certificates of its efficacy flowed in from all parts; the storm- clouds were seen by veracious witnesses collect¬ ing over those poles, and rolling their hail¬ stones harmless along the straw to the ground",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The cultivators of the mountain districts on the confines of France, Switzerland, Italy, and Ger¬ many, seemed enchanted by the discovery, and whole fields were planted with those Paragreles, which, like embattled spears, dared the front of heaven. The question relative to the utility of Hail-Protectors was now referred to the Institute of France; but that learned body, though it clung to the charm of the Thunder-Rod or Paratonnerre, rejected with scorn the pretensions of the Paragrile. But the faith of the believers was not so easily shaken, and a succession of angry and querulous pamphlets for a while kept up the dispute. Yet we may infer that the con¬ fidence in the efficacy of such notable protectors is fast declining, since an old auxiliary—the agi¬ tation of the air by the firing of mortars—has been recalled to their aid.1 In the latter part of the eighteenth century, Electricity was enriched by a continual acces¬ sion of curious facts and experiments. New instruments were devised, of nicer construc¬ tion, to measure the intensity of electrical at¬ tractions and repulsions. The catalogue of electrics themselves was not only extended, but rendered more definite, by distinguish- ingThe opposite qualities of the substances rub¬ bed. Some steps have likewise been made towards a more precise theory. If a ball elec¬ trified vitreously be approached to an insulated cylinder, the nearer end will assume the resin¬ ous electricity, while the remoter extremity will indicate the vitreous; the limit of neutrality al¬ ways advancing to the approximating ball. This capital experiment appears to furnish the true explication of the Leyden Jar. But it involves a more extensive principle: Pressure may be con¬ sidered as only close apposition, and friction is evidently a case of repeated pressure. Hence the action of the Electrical Machine itself, and hence likewise the theory of that beautiful contrivance, the Electrophorus, first announced by Wilke of Stockholm in 1762, but named and fully de¬ scribed in 1776 by Volta2 of Como, to whom electrical science was afterwards so much in- 1 Orioli, professor of Natural Philosophy at Bologna, seems not disposed to acquiesce in the decision of the Academy of Sciences at Paris.

"The close of the eighteenth century was dis¬ tinguished by the accession of a new branch of Electrical Science, more brilliant and astonish¬ ing than even the parent stock. It originated in a fortunate incident which occurred in the year 1790. Galvani, whose name it bears, pro¬ fessor of anatomy at Bologna, remarked, in the course of his demonstrations, that the limbs of a dissected frog were strongly convulsed at every spark which one of his pupils happened to draw from the prime conductor of an electrical ma¬ chine standing in the immediate vicinity.2 Being thus led to consider the subject, he made several curious experiments, and published a Disserta¬ tion on Animal Electricity, which engaged very general attention. The femoral muscles of a frog, bared of their integuments, hut left connect¬ ed with the trunk of nerves, were found to serve as a most delicate sort of electrometer. With this aid, it was easy to trace the faintest vestiges of electrical influence, and to contrast the proper¬ ties of various conductors. The very weakest chemical solutions, the mere contact of different metals, nay the apposition of animal fibres, were all found in their several degrees to develope electricity. But the simplest mode of exciting it is, by the mutual application of small plates or discs of copper and zinc. Dr Robison made a ca¬ pital improvement, in proposing a pillar of those discs, like a rouleauof half-crowns, to augment by their combination the intensity of effect. This happy idea seems to have been overlooked, when Volta in 1800 invented his famous Pile; the most energetic instrument of all electrico-che- mical analysis, and commencing deservedly a new epoch in physical science. By Crookshanks it was rendered far more commodious, in being converted into the Galvanic Trough; which, again enlarged into Batteries sometimes of enor¬ mous extent or dimensions, has conducted Davy, Berzelius, and others, to the most splendid and wonderful discoveries",Bologna,IT,8,Italy,Europe

About this period, when ob¬ servations were not very precise, the needle was judged to turn nearly towards the north; but Columbus, in his first voyage of discovery, found it to decline from the meridian as he advanced on the Atlantic; and this apparent change of the laws of nature occurred under circumstances which would have appalled a less determined commander.

In the year 1657, it stood directly north at London; and it held the same meridional position in 1660 at Paris.

"rate of augmentation has been scarcely 2, and the change at Paris is still smaller. This rapid decline of the annual change appeared to intimate the needle’s approach to the limit of westerly digression, from which it would slowly return in the contrary direction. Such expecta¬ tion, however, is not yet realized. In 1817 the needle was observed at Paris to make indeed a slight retreat; hut, in the following year, it moved forward again, and continues to advance, though slowly, to the west. Its relaxation in London is less apparent.1 But the variation of the needle, besides its annual progress, is liable to other alternating changes, amounting sometimes to a considerable quantity. Its diurnal deviation was first re¬ marked by Graham in 1722, and ascertained with more precision in 1750 by Wargentin of Stockholm. But Canton investigated the sub¬ ject with great ability and perseverance, in a very extended series of observations begun in 1756. He found the needle to travel westwards from about nine o’clock in the morning till two in the afternoon, when it remained for a while stationary, and again slowly returned, regaining its station during the night, or before the early dawn. In the morning, its movements were less regular. The extent of those digressions was found to depend on the season of the year: near the end of December, the diurnal aberra¬ tion was only 7', but it mounted to 13^' about the middle of June","Paris, Paris, London, Graham, Stockholm","US,GB,SE",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Sweden","North America,Europe,Europe"

"The chief properties of the rays of Light con¬ sist in Reflexion and Refraction. With the for¬ mer the ancients were sufficiently acquainted, but they had only a vague notion of the con¬ nexion between the angles of Incidence and Re¬ fraction. It is somewhat singular that both the Telescope and the Microscope should have been several years invented before the law on which their construction depends, or the constant re¬ lation between the sines of those angles, was de¬ tected. This important discovery was made by Snellius, but simplified and first published in 1637 by Descartes, who greatly reformed opti¬ cal science. The progressive motion of Light was next beautifully deduced from the annual anticipation and retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, by the ingenuity of Roemer, a young Danish astronomer, who had been in¬ vited to France in 1672, and there liberally en¬ tertained for nine years, till he was recalled to his native country and loaded with lucrative and honourable appointments. One might suppose that the aberration of the fixed stars, or their apparent circular shifting in the heavens, would have been hence anticipated, as a simple in¬ ference from the motion of Light combined with the revolution of the Earth in its orbit. Such a consequence had been foreseen by the acute mind of Descartes, who therefore adopted the instantaneous propulsion of light as a funda¬ mental principle in his Dioptrics. Were it otherwise, he maintained the stars would not appear in their true positions, and the sun would be seen eclipsed long after his conjunc¬ tion with the moon. These considerations, however, were quite overlooked, when Bradley in 1729 established his fine discovery within close limits, but on the very same grounds.1 Astronomers had been obliged to abandon their attempts to construct telescopes of much higher magnifying powers, and to contract the apertures, and consequently to reduce the mea¬ sure of illumination in order to procure distinct vision. Colour was still imagined to depend merely on the various mixture of light and shade. But Newton’s grand discovery of the decomposition of the Solar Beam, first communi¬ cated to the Royal Society in 1671, and further explained by his correspondence during the three following years, changed the whole aspect of the science. The ingenuity in devising the simple and beautiful experiments with combined prisms, is not more admirable, than the force and clear¬ ness of the reasoning which deduced from them such splendid conclusions. The mild spirit of the philosopher was wounded by the attacks of petulance and contradiction; and he quietly re¬ tained, in his closet, for the space of upwards of thirty years, the sequel of those invaluable experiments, and only consented to publish the Treatise of Optics after his reputation had final¬ ly triumphed over all opposition. This resolution is much to be regretted, as it not only post¬ poned the diffusion of genuine science, but gave occasion to the blending of some speculations which the discerning author would probably not have published in the high meridian of his in¬ tellect. Though the experimental procedure on which the work rests had been strictly induc¬ tive, yet was the composition cast in a synthetical form,—broken into a series of propositions, with their preliminary apparatus of Axioms and De¬ finitions ; which commonly involve assumptions, and so far from giving more precision to our reasonings, imperceptibly lead to the admis- 1 In a letter of Descartes, bearing the date of 1634, he notices an experiment proposed by a Dutch correspondent, to prove that Light takes a sensible time to arrive at the eye from a distance. This was to wave a tiaming torch at night, and observe its reflexion from a mirror removed only a quarter of a league. The French philosopher with his friends repeated the experiment several times, and could not discern the smallest interval between each bending of the flame and its reflexion","Jupiter, Bradley","US,FR,NL",8,"United States,France,Netherlands","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Certain it is that the philosophers on the Con¬ tinent generally refused to admit the accuracy of the conclusions of the Treatise of Optics, and Mariotte, the most ingenious and skilful of the French experimentalists, was unsuccessful in his attempts at the prismatic decomposition of the sun’s rays. His failure must no doubt be attri¬ buted to the influence of prejudice, and the stiff¬ ness of advanced age ; but finally to silence all such opposition, it was judged expedient in 1716 that Besaguliers should repeat and somewhat vary the original experiments before a committee of the Royal Society at London",London,"GB,FR",8,"United Kingdom,France","Europe,Europe"
"to the Royal Society of London, a short paper, showing that the principle advanced by Euler was discordant with the property deducible from the Newtonian experiments. But it did not thence follow that either of these must be the true Law of Nature; and accordingly Klingen- stierna, an ingenious and learned Swedish philo¬ sopher, proved that the hypothesis espoused by Dolland would not stand a rigorous analytical investigation. The English artist was therefore compelled to adopt the only sure and decisive mode of settling the question, the unbiassed appeal to experiment. He soon found that his preconceptions were inaccurate, and that refrac¬ tion may subsist without any fringe of colour",London,"GB,SE",8,"United Kingdom,Sweden","Europe,Europe"
"The French have ingeniously directed the principles of Optics to the improvement of Light-Houses. In this useful pursuit the cele¬ brated Buffon led the way. Endeavouring to realize the performance ascribed to Archimedes, he disposed 400 mirrors, each of them half a foot square, into a frame, so as to collect the sun’s rays into a single focus, and by the re¬ flexion from this large surface in 1747 he ac¬ tually set fire to wood at the distance of 70 yards. The experiment was next inverted, and a burner placed in the focus, to have its rays thrown parallel, and produce remote illumina¬ tion. But for this purpose a much smaller reflec¬ tor was sufficient, composed of bits of mirror planted in a spherical cavity. The final improve¬ ment consisted in hammering thin plated copper into a parabolic shape. These powerful reflec¬ tors, combined with Argand’s lamp, were about thirty years since introduced from France into our light-houses",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The knowledge of such attempts was not wanted to direct the ingenuity of Fresnel1 into the right path. He calculated the curvature of the suc¬ cessive concentric segments which would pro¬ duce a correct focus, and advanced the construc¬ tion to a regular system, on which Soleil, an ex¬ pert optician at Paris, has founded a manufac¬ ture. This compound lens has displaced the re¬ flectors from the French light-houses, and must soon, from its very superior power of concentra¬ tion, become generally adopted",Paris,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Such may he regarded the fine detection of the polarized rays of light by Malus, a French officer of Engineers, and one of the most ardent dis¬ ciples of the Polytechnic School; which in so short a period drew together and put into rapid motion a far greater mass of mathematical and physical talent than any of the older seminaries in Europe. The double refracting property of Iceland Spar, or the crystallized carbonate of lime, noticed by Bartholinus and accurately in¬ vestigated by Huygens, had likewise engaged the penetration of Newton, who concluded that the ray which suffers the unusual or extraordinary refraction must have its opposite sides affected by some virtue like magnetism which gives them a tendency to polarity.2 * 4 This curious and acute remark appears to have lain neglected near a hundred years among the crowd of ingenious speculations started in the optical queries.

At magnopere dubitandum artem in hoc negotio naturam posse imitari. (Piiotometria, sive de Mensura et Gradibus Lutninis, Colorum, et Umbrae, p. 7-) 4 The whole passage deserves transcribing. “ The unusual refraction of island crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some kind of attractive virtue lodged in certain sides both of the rays and of the particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of disposition, or virtue, lodged in some sides of the particles of the crystal, and not in their other sides, and which inclines and bends the rays towards the coast of unusual refraction, the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystal would not be refracted towards that coast rather than towards any other coast, both at their incidence and at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly, by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction, at the second surface; the crystal acting upon the rays after they have passed through it and are emerging into the air, or, if you please, into a vacuum. And since the crystal by this disposition or virtue does not act upon the rays, unless when one of their sides of unusual refraction looks towards that coast, this argues a virtue or disposition in those sides of the rays, which answers to and sympathizes with that virtue or disposition of the crystal, as the poles of two magnets answer to one another. And as mag¬ netism may be intended or remitted, and is found only in the magnet and in iron ; so this virtue, of refracting the perpen¬ dicular rays, is greater in island crystal, less in crystal of the rock, and is not yet found in other bodies. I do not say that this virtue is magnetical; it seems to be of another kind: I only say, that whatever it be, it is difficult to conceive how the rays oflight, unless they be bodies, can have a permanent virtue in two of their sides, which is not in their other sides; and this without any regard to their position to the space, or the medium, through which they pass.” {Optics, book iii",Newton,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"755 lus had early turned his attention to the more difficult problems in optics, and after his return, with a shattered constitution from an absence of several years spent in foreign service, obtaining more congenial employment at home, he re¬ sumed with enthusiasm his favourite studies, and devoted to them every moment he could spare. While intensely occupied with the in¬ vestigation of the phsenomena of double refrac¬ tion, a fortunate accident occurred, which dis¬ closed to him a new and splendid field of con¬ templation. In one of his frequent visits to the Observatory, during his residence at Paris, he chanced in the summer of 1809 to be struck with the brilliant reflexion of the setting sun from one of the windows of the Luxembourg Palace, on looking at the appearance through a prism of rock crystal which he slowly turned round, and remarked with surprise that one of the images changed regularly to brightness from obscurity. Next morning he repeated this 6. DOCTRINE Heat is the great principle of all internal mo¬ tion. Its various changes and gradations deter¬ mine the growth of plants and the expansion of animated beings. The knowledge of the pro¬ duction of fire was the earliest of human disco¬ veries, and already distinguished our species in its lowest condition from the brute tenants of the forest.

"The Florentine Academicians, about the year 1655, first constructed an instrument of that kind, consisting as before of a glass ball, but filled with spirit of wine, and having its stem of a smaller bore, sealed hermetically, or melted at the top by the flame of a blow-pipe. Italy had thus the honour of inventing both those instru¬ ments, the Thermometer and Barometer, the most important auxiliaries of modern science",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"757 melt is always the same. Guericke was the first who started from the thawing point, in di¬ viding the scale of a large spirit of wine ther¬ mometer. To regulate the divisions, two different ways occurred; either to assume a higher point, or to distinguish into small portions the capa¬ city of the hall. The latter was the mode adopt¬ ed by Newton, who recreated his mind with chemical experiments. Employing linseed oil, which expands largely, and bears a great heat, he subdivided the capacity of the glass into 10,000 equal parts; and beginning from the point of thawing ice, he found the liquid to ex¬ pand 256 at the heat of the human body, 725 at boiling water, and 1516 at melting tin ; but preferring smaller numbers, he assumed 12 for blood heat, and reduced the other numbers in the same proportion to 34 and 71. This method was quite philosophical, but of very difficult execution. A correct and ingenious process for determining the scale of heat was proposed in 1694 by Renaldini, a learned Italian mathema¬ tician. Taking the freezing and boiling of water for the extremes, he found the interme¬ diate points from a mixture of ten parts, com¬ posed progressively of melting snow and water just ceased from ebullition, the ingredients being 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, &c. About twenty years afterwards, Brook Taylor and Hauksbee applied that ingenious mode to as¬ certain whether the expansions of certain fluids are exactly proportional to the corresponding accessions of heat",Newton,"US,IT",8,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"
"The thermometers manufactured by Fahren¬ heit being remarkably neat and convenient, were, notwithstanding their arbitrary subdivision, widely dispersed over Germany, and introduced into Britain by the practitioners in physic, who at that period usually resorted to Holland for medi¬ cal instruction. But most strangely in France a very unwieldy and inaccurate instrument maintained its ascendancy. The thermometer of Reaumur had a ball near four inches in dia¬ meter, which was filled with spirit of wine dilut¬ ed with water.

"Wolfius, who about this time was spatiating over the vast field of physical and moral science, and forming a new philosophical sect in Germany, taught that bodies had two sorts of interstices, the one filled with air and the other charged with fire. He attempted to explain why iron acquires heat sooner than wood, and why the solution in nitre occasions cold; but neglecting to follow experiments, he produced only vague andshallow speculation. Equally visionary, but enlivened by French vivacity, was Mairau’s Dissertation on Ice, published in 1740",,"DE,FR",8,"Germany,France","Europe,Europe"
"759 About this time, the practice of making obser¬ vations with the thermometer had become pretty general in England, in consequence of the dif¬ fusion of the very neat and accurate instruments manufactured by Fahrenheit and Prins, at Am¬ sterdam, which were likewise imitated in London by Wilson, who afterwards established a flou¬ rishing type-foundry at Glasgow, and held the professorship of Practical Astronomy. These thermometers were filled with quicksilver, and only four or five inches long, the stem clasped by a folded paper scale, engraved with successively bisected divisions, and the whole inclosed in a thin glass case. But the most philosophical con¬ struction of the thermometer was now proposed by tbe learned Celsius, who filled the chair of Astronomy in the University of Upsal, and had borne an active share in the operation of deter¬ mining a degree of latitude on the verge of the Arctic Circle. He started from the point of congelation, and reckoned just a hundred di¬ visions upwards to that of ebullition. This simple scale, commonly used in Sweden and Denmark, is the same as that which was after¬ wards adopted by the French under the name of centigrade^ in their complete and elegant system of decimal weights and measures. It is singular that Deluc, in rectifying Reaumur’s thermometer, should have retained such an arti¬ ficial subdivision as that by fourscore. But this philosopher had the merit of ascertaining that mercury dilates almost uniformly with equal additions of heat, while the expansion of the spirit of wine is variable, and ascends with an accelerating progression. A thermometer form¬ ed of alcohol, whether diluted or not, is hence exceedingly inaccurate, unless it be regulated by the comparison with a mercurial one","London, Wilson, Glasgow, University","GB,US,SE,DK,FR",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Sweden,Denmark,France","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"The practice of using thermometers filled with quicksilver led to the curious discovery of the con¬ gelation of that dense liquid. Professor Gmelin, who had been sent with a party of naturalists to explore the remote regions of the Russian empire, observed in Siberia, on the 16th of January 1735, the mercury to sink in the ther¬ mometric tube to a point which corresponds to the 120th degree below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale, while it changed into a solid mass. But the artificial freezing of mercury was first per¬ formed by Braun, Professor of Philosophy at Petersburg, in the month of December 1759, when the natural cold seemed to be 34° under tbe beginning of the scale. Having plunged the bulb of a thermometer into a mixture of pounded ice and sal ammoniac, the quicksilver appeared to sink progresively to 350°, and then to consolidate",Petersburg,"US,RU",8,"United States,Russian Federation","North America,Europe"
"About the year 1750, Dr Cullen, then Lecturer in Chemistry at Glasgow, in repeating some experiments with a pupil, remarked that a ther¬ mometer with a wetted bulb showed a much greater depression of temperature under the ex¬ hausted receiver of an air-pump. But he did not pursue the observation farther, or attempt PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS",Glasgow,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"Unfortunately he seems to have introduced the term Capacity, which involves a crude notion, as if heat were merely passive, filling up the interior pores or internal vacuities of bodies. But, a few years afterwards, Wilcke of Stockholm, directed, he says, by the views of his col¬ league Klingenstierna, a mathematician and philosopher of the first order, examined the sub¬ ject philosophically, and performed several accu¬ rate experiments. Thus, he found that water at 98° of Celsius, poured upon an equal weight of snow, had its temperature reduced to 13°, and that three parts of water at 40°, joined to one of snow, produced the common temperature of 12°. These trials gave both the same result, or 73° of Celsius, corresponding to \2Q'Qa on Fah¬ renheit’s scale, for the increase of heat required to convert snow into water.1 A similar conclu¬ sion was obtained by filling equal tin vessels with equal parts of snow and snow-water, and placing these within a larger one full of boiling water, and set over a fire; the moment the chill water rose to 72°, the snow had all melted",Stockholm,SE,8,Sweden,Europe
"In 1780 Lavoisier, assisted by Laplace, and employing his Calorimeter, ascertained the heat evolved from different bodies during their va¬ rious changes, from the several quantities of ice which it melted. This seemed to be a very simple and correct mode of investigation; yet was it liable to considerable inaccuracy, from the large portion of water which still remained adhering to the mass of pounded ice. But the French chemists rather confused the subject, by mixing up incongruous principles. Embracing the the¬ ory of Capacity, they likewise tacitly adopted the hypothesis of sensible and latent heat, only changing these terms by a sort of appropriation into free and absolute, while the poverty of their language suggested for that fluid such an im¬ perfect etymon as Caloric",Laplace,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Indeed the art of applying a metallic plate to the surface of glass is a modern invention. The earliest method was the Dutch, which consisted in pouring melted lead intensely hot over a sheet of glass softened nearly to fusion. But the adhesion was afterwards more easily obtained in the ordinary way, by applying tinfoil to the glass, and dextrously flooding it with mercury, to form an amalgam. It is from this shining metallic coating that light is chiefly reflected, having pene¬ trated and again escaped through the substance of the glass. But with regard to Heat, a very small reverberation takes place at the anterior surface of the glass, and the effect is exactly the same if the silvering be rubbed off. It would prevent much confusion were chemical writers to appropriate the term speculum to metallic reflectors",,NL,8,Netherlands,Europe
"It was an object of much greater consequence to construct a register-thermometer, which should mark the greatest heat and cold during the ab¬ sence of the observer. This had been attempted by dift'erent experimenters in the course of the eighteenth century, but was first carried to any tolerable perfection about the year 1780, by Mr Six of Canterbury. These registers consisted of spirit of wine thermometers, with compound reverted stems, partially filled with quicksilver, which carried small bits of steel to indicate the limits of ascent. With such instruments the inventor made some curious observations on local heat, or on the differences of temperature at moderate altitudes during the alternations of day and night.

"The depressed temperature was commonly attri¬ buted to a process of rapid evaporation, which seemed to result from the combined action of vari¬ ous causes,—the heat of the air, its state of dry¬ ness or rarefaction, hut especially the swiftness of its circulation. Halley had, near the close of the seventeenth century, advanced the rational hypothesis, that moisture is exhaled from the surface of water by a sort of chemical solution in the atmosphere. The same opinion was about the middle of the following century pro¬ posed and expounded by Le Roy of Montpellier; but though supported by concurring analogies, it might appear perhaps too simple for the ge¬ neral taste. The fanciful notion, first started by Derham, that evaporation is occasioned by very minute vesicles or hollow spherules of water, charged with highly attenuated air, which rise and float in the atmosphere, proved more acceptable to a wondering public. The vesicular theory afterwards obtained a wide currency from the philosophical reputation of Saussure, who considered it as countenanced by some dubious optical appearances. But the mere subdivision of fluid matter could produce no change of tem¬ perature, and the clearest facts are opposed to the notion of a passive dispersion of aqueous corpuscles",Montpellier,FR,8,France,Europe

"In the case of an oblate spheroid, therefore, those degrees would regularly enlarge from the equator to the pole. But the Trigonometrical Mensuration of France, begun by Picard in 1675, and completed in 1716 by Cassini, form¬ ing the most extensive survey yet attempted, was found leading to an opposite conclusion in the meridional arc, the degrees on the north of Paris, instead of lengthening, appearing to con¬ tract about a 430th partbelow those on the south, which would indicate an oblong figure, having its perpendicular diameters as 96 to 95. This perplexing result served to keep alive for some time longer the controversy on the Continent between the followers of Descartes and the grow¬ ing partisans of the Newtonian Philosophy. In the meanwhile, a clock made by the famous Graham, and carried out to Jamaica in 1732 by Colin Campbell, was ascertained by astronomical observations at Black-river, in the latitude of 18°, allowing for the influence of heat on the pendu¬ lum, to go 1' 58"" slower every day than in Lon¬ don. This quantity of variation Bradley found to exceed what would suit the figure calculat¬ ed by Newton, and he was therefore disposed to attribute the effects to some diminution of density in the equatorial regions. James Stirling compris¬ ed the attractions of homogeneous spheroids un¬ der two beautiful theorems, which were publish¬ ed, though without demonstrations, in the Philo¬ sophical Transactions for 1735. About the same time Bouguer noticed some restrictions essential to the rigorous solution of the problem; but now Maclaurin took a most commanding view of the subject, and produced, first in his famous Dissertation on the Tides, and again more fully in his Treatise of Fluxions, printed in 1742, a geo¬ metrical investigation, distinguished by its ori¬ ginality, clearness, and superior elegance. This illustrious mathematician established, from the law of gravitation, the stability of a fluid sphe¬ roid revolving about its axis in a certain time, proved that every point within the mass would be pressed equally on all sides, and showed that even the superadded attractions of the sun and moon could not disturb the internal equilibrium of our Earth. The conclusions applied likewise to the other planets, and embraced the theory of the tides.

"The most refined theory, thus confirming the Newtonian figure of the Earth, again recalled the attention of philosophers to the actual sur¬ vey of its surface. The French triangulation being resumed in 1740, an error was detected in the measurement of the base, and another not less considerable in the observation of the meridional arc; but to rectify the various de¬ tails required the labour of several years, nor did the work terminate before 1754. In the extent of above eight degrees, their lengths ap¬ peared regularly to increase, from Perpignan to Dunkirk, by about the 1730th part; marking evidently the oblateness of the spheroid",Perpignan,FR,8,France,Europe

Stirling, in his answer, dated in September 1730, frankly remar s, that “ it is somewhat strange, that though the Principles have been published above 40 years, nobody has read further ran the two first books, although they be barely speculations, and were written for no other reason but that the third might be un* derstood.” (From a collection of Stirling’s papers in the possession of Mr Irving, one of the Judges of the Court ot Ses¬ sion, under the title of Lord Newton.)

"773 damine, Bouguer, and Godin, in May 1735 sailed from Rochelle to Peru, where they joined Juan and Ulloa, two naval officers deputed by the king of Spain. The whole company assembled in the month of June in the following year at Quito, almost under the Equator, and arranged their plan of operations. They chose a valley of the Cordilleras running above 200 miles south¬ wards from that city, and inclosed on both sides by the loftiest ranges of the Andes. Divided into two troops, they carried a series of triangles along the flanks and summits of those stupen¬ dous mountains covered with eternal snows, and connected the reticulation with the base mea¬ sured below. In pursuing their laborious task, the observers had to encounter the greatest dif¬ ficulties, and to suffer privations of every kind, owing to the severity of the climate and the total want of accommodation, joined to the con¬ tinual impediments occasioned by the supersti¬ tion of the natives and the pilfering habits of the Indians. But resolution and perseverance at length overcame the multiplied obstacles, though no fewer than eight years were consum¬ ed in completing with elaborate care and accu¬ racy the different operations undertaken. Con- damine was a man of an ardent and active mind, and persuasive address; Godin, an excellent ob¬ server ; but Bouguer combined the character of a deep and original thinker, with the talent of invention, unwearied application, and an ex¬ tended acquaintance in the various pursuits of philosophy and science. The Academicians were ably assisted by their Spanish associates, though each performed separately his own calculations",Quito,"ES,PE,EC",8,"Spain,Peru,Ecuador","Europe,South America,South America"
"In the mean time, it being foreseen that the mensuration of a degree in Peru would be ne¬ cessarily retarded, the celebrated Maupertuis, a person of agreeable attainments, though not very profound in science, prevailed with the French minister Maurepas to dispatch another company, which he reluctantly consented to lead, for a similar purpose to the Arctic Circle",Maurepas,"FR,PE",8,"France,Peru","Europe,South America"
"His associates were Monnier, Camus, Outhier, and Clairaut, already distinguished by the pre¬ cocity of his fine mathematical genius. They arrived at Stockholm in June 1736, and were joined by Celsius, the professor of astronomy at Upsal, who had brought from London Graham’s zenith sector and transit instruments. Having settled their general plan, they proceeded to the bottom of the Gulf of Bothnia, and selected Tornea for the principal station. From that small capital they stretched a chain of triangles along the wooded heights to the top of Kittis, a distance however not exceeding 60 miles. Work¬ ing with great spirit and activity, and having no difficulties to encounter but the severity of the climate, they observed the angles from the several stations during the remainder of the summer, determined the celestial arc in autumn, and measured the base along the frozen surface of the river Muonio in the early part of winter",Stockholm,SE,8,Sweden,Europe
"The length of a degree of latitude at the Arctic Circle was found to be 57,419 toises, or 349 toises longer than the corresponding measure at Paris, which gave the ratio of 178 to 177 for that of the Equatorial and Polar diameters, al¬ most the same as the result of the more exten¬ sive operations afterwards in Peru. Maupertuis, having with such expedition ascertained the ob¬ lateness of the Earth, and assigned a depression still greater than had been computed by Newton, returned triumphant to Paris in the spring of 1737. But this arctic triangulation, betraying evident marks of haste, became suspected after¬ wards of inaccuracy; and, at the suggestion of Melanderhjelm, the Swedish academy, about the PRELIMINARY DISSERTATIONS","Paris, Newton, Paris","US,PE,SE",8,"United States,Peru,Sweden","North America,South America,Europe"
"It was then determined that the length of a degree in Lapland is only 57,209 toises, which, compared with Cassinis coriected measure m France, reduces the oblateness to the 290th part of the Earth’s axis. But a more accurate result is obtained from the comparison of the distant observations made under the Equator and at the Arctic Circle, the perpendicular diameters of the terrestrial spheroid being in the ratio of 302 to 301. Still greater nicety has been attempted by Littrow, who, on re-computing the degree in Lapland, reduced it to 57,168 toises, which gives an oblateness of only —J—",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Other determinations of a degree of latitude have been made at different parts of the Earth’s surface, the most remarkable of which may be noticed. La Caille, one of the best observers, and the most accurate and laborious of astro¬ nomers, rectified the French triangulation du¬ ring the years 1739 and 1740; nor did the ex¬ treme severity of that memorable winter prevent his carrying forward these operations over the lofty mountains of Auvergne. He proved decid¬ edly that the degrees of the meridian regularly increase from the south to the north of France",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Some years afterwards he went to the Cape of Good Hope, chiefly for the purpose of framing a catalogue of the stars of the Southern Constel¬ lations ; but his ardour and extreme activity en¬ abled him to accumulate other valuable celes¬ tial observations. Having performed the task he had proposed, and the ship not arriving to carry him home, La Caille was tempted to em¬ ploy the time thus afforded in measuring by his single exertions a degree of latitude. This he found, on the parallel of 34°, to be 57,037 toises, and therefore of the same length with a degree as far north as 49° in France; which seems to indicate not only a flatter outline, but a difference of internal constitution in the southern hemisphere. The accuracy of the measurement itself, however, has been strongly suspected",,FR,8,France,Europe
"After a pause of near forty years, the mensu¬ ration of the Earth was revived with increasing ardour and on a grander scale. The object first contemplated was merely to settle the difference of longitude between the observatories of Green¬ wich and Paris, by connecting them with a se¬ ries of triangles. General Roy directed the English survey in 1784, while similar operations were conducted by Cassini in France. The Re¬ volution soon followed, and prepared the public mind for the reception of every bold project. It was now proposed to adopt a universal and permanent system of weights and measures drawn from nature, the unit of lineal' extent being the thousandth part of a centesimal minute, or the ten millionth part of the quadrantal arc from the Pole to the Equator. To obtain this standard, it had been resolved to carry a chain of triangles over the whole extent, from Dunkirk to Barcelona; which was performed during the most eventful period of general excitement and commotion, by the profound sagacity, persever¬ ance, and undaunted zeal of Delambre,1 joined to 1 Born at Amiens on the 19th September 1749. Being designed for the church, he studied the ancient languages in the Gymnasium of his native city, first under the Jesuits, and afterwards under the tuition of the poet Delille, to whom he became warmly attached. At a ripe age, he was invited to the study of astronomy by Lalande, and soon adopted as his favourite pupil. In 1785 he began the vast series of his scientific labours, which occupied the rest of a long life. Without aiming at originality, Delambre produced very complete and valuable works, pursued his immense calculations with scrupulous nicety and incessant application, and distinguished himself as a most accurate, skilful, and indefatigable observer. He sought precision merely, and was rather indifferent about the elegance of his formulas or composition. Yet he was an ex¬ cellent Greek scholar, well acquainted with the principal modern languages, and indeed a man of general erudition. Gt an amiable disposition, with fixed principles of integrity joined to simple habits, he passed through all the storms of the Be- volution with a blameless character. He obtained his full share of the honours and distinction which France so liberally bestows on those eminent in science, and died universally regretted, on the 19th of August 1822","Green, Paris, Barcelona, Born, Amiens","FR,US,VE,NL,UK,PL,GR",8,"France,United States,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,Netherlands,N/A,Poland,Greece","Europe,North America,South America,Europe,N/A,Europe,Europe"
"775 Mechain.1 After completing1 this operation, they measured abase of seven miles in length near Paris, and another of verification, somewhat shorter, on the road from Perpignan to Narhonne. The register of all the observations was in the spring of 1799 submitted to a sort of congress of scien¬ tific men assembled in the French capital, who having examined and repeated the various calcu¬ lations, and compared the celestial arc with the mensuration in Peru, adopted the 334th for the oblateness of the earth, and determined the dis¬ tance of the pole from the equator to be 5,130,740 toises","Paris, Perpignan","FR,PE,US",8,"France,Peru,United States","Europe,South America,North America"
"Mechain, anxious however to extend the me¬ ridian as far as the Balearic Isles, again repaired to Spain, and conducted a series of triangles over the savage heights from Barcelona to Tortosa, when, exhausted by incessant fatigues, he caught an epidemic fever, which proved fatal in Septem¬ ber 1805. The operations were continued by his young but very able successors, Biot and Arago, who terminated the meridional arc at the isle of Formentera in 1807. This extension of the chain scarcely altered in the slightest man¬ ner the former conclusion","Barcelona, Tortosa","ES,VE",8,"Spain,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","Europe,South America"
"The English survey, being designed merely for the construction of an accurate set of maps, suffered some interruption by the death of Gene¬ ral Roy, but was resumed with spirit in 1793, under the skilful direction of Colonel Mudge, who carried the triangulation as far as the north of Scotland; and since his decease in 1820, the work has been transferred to Ireland by his per¬ severing assistant and successor Colonel Colby",Roy,"IE,US",8,"Ireland,United States","Europe,North America"
"Those operations have no doubt proceeded very slowly, and yet the results of the first series were perplexing, the three degrees measured from Bunnose to Clifton successively contract¬ ing instead of lengthening, and therefore indicat¬ ing, like the earlier observations of Cassini, an oblong figure of the Earth. The whole arc agrees exactly with the last triangulation of France, in giving an oblateness of only the 334th part; but whether the intermediate discrepancies should be imputed to an error of azimuth, or to the pro¬ bable derangement from local attraction, still remains undecided",Clifton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"In 1802 and 1803 Colonel Lambton measured a degree of the meridian in the East Indies, and found, at the latitudes of 9° 35', 12° 3', and 16° 35', the lengths to rise successively to 60,477, 60,490, and 60,512 fathoms. Hence Delambre deduced the oblateness of the terrestrial spheroid to be the 206th part. But Rodriguez, an able Spanish ma¬ thematician, who had already criticised the obser¬ vations of Mudge, detected various mistakes in Lambton’s calculations, which being rectified, reduced the depression of the Earth to the 320th part",,ES,8,Spain,Europe
"Cassini and Maraldi seem to have been the first to solve this interesting question. They found, in 1734 and 1735, a degree of longitude at Paris and at Strasburg to be 36,676 and 37,745 toises, 1 Born at Laon 16th August'l744, the son of an unprosperous architect, who could hardly educate him in the same pro¬ fession. The youth supported himself, and even aided his father, by teaching mathematics, and made such proficiency in astronomy as to attract the notice of Lalande, by whose warm and active patronage he soon obtained the office of hydro- grapher to the Marine at Versailles. Though he had not the talent of invention, he became an expert, patient, and correct calculator. He was, besides, a very nice and accurate observer, and applied himself particularly to the search of comets, and the computation of their orbits. In 1784 he was joined to the commission for adjusting the difference of longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich; and when the Constituent Assembly had resolved to adopt a grand metrical system founded on the length of the meridional arc, he was appointed to measure the southern portion of it from Barcelona to Kodez","Paris, Born, Laon, Versailles, Paris, Barcelona","US,FR,NL,VE",8,"United States,France,Netherlands,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","North America,Europe,Europe,South America"
"He conducted his operations with great celerity and success ; but, inspecting a new engine constructed by a friend at Barce¬ lona, he met with a dreadful accident, which had well nigh proved fatal. After a slow convalescence he resumed his labours; but every thing now combined to dishearten him,—the Avar with Spain, the ravages of the yellow fever, and the news of the reign of terror in France. After moderation had revived, Mechain with much reluctance was prevailed on to come to Paris ; but strongly pressed the expediency of extending the measurement two degrees farther into Spain, and insisted on carrying on that work himself. This pertinacity was not explained till after his death, when it appeared that he had concealed a discrepancy occurring in the rectification of his observations, which, without acknowledging the error, he no doubt hoped to remove by subsequent operations. After experiencing many difficulties, he vigorously renewed his labours in Valencia ; but his mind was depressed by anxiety for his reputation, and alarms at the spread of contagious disease. This mental prostration favoured its attack, and he expired of yellow fever in his retreat at Castellon de la Plana, on the 20th September 1805","Paris, Valencia","ES,FR,US,VE",8,"Spain,France,United States,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of","Europe,Europe,North America,South America"
"and therefore considerably less than what belongs to a perfect sphere. But the most accurate ob¬ servation of this kind was made by La Caille in 1740, from the top of a hill near Aix, to a signal on a high tower above the Rhone, about 96 miles remote, where he caused ten pounds of gunpowder to he fired, and found by the instantaneous blaze the difference of time between the two meridians, and then measured trigonometrically along the plain of Arles the intermediate distance, which gave 41,858 toises for a degree of longitude, or 260 toises less than a globular form would re¬ quire. Lambton estimated the degree of longi¬ tude on the parallel of 12° 82' to be 61,061 fathoms, or 57,294 toises; but his observations, and calculations seem not entitled to much con¬ fidence. The latest and most accurate measure¬ ment of a perpendicular to the meridian was performed in 1823, near Geneva, by Colonel Brousseaud, of theFrench engineers, in connexion with the late ingenious Professor Pictet, while the skilful astronomers Plana and Carlini com¬ pleted a similar operation on the plains of Italy as far as Padua. The first, being compared with the arc from Greenwich to Formentera, gave a 271st part for the oblateness of the Earth; but, when conjoined with the Italian prolongation, it redu¬ ced the quantity of depression to a 292d part of the equatorial diameter. It must be confessed, how¬ ever, that the accuracy of these conclusions has been contested by some of the ablest calculators","Arles, Geneva","IT,FR,US",8,"Italy,France,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"From a skilful combination of the five prin¬ cipal measurements, in Peru, India, France, England, and Lapland, Mr Ivory has, by the method of the least squares, deduced for the oblateness of the Earth, and shown that the corresponding elliptical meridian agrees with the best observations.

To arrive at so satisfactory a result, however, it was necessary to exclude nearly one-sixth of all the observa¬ tions, those made near the equator being the most discordant. Such aberrations leave con¬ siderable distrust, which is not removed by in¬ specting the later observations. But it were idle to affect extreme precision, where the discre¬ pancy amounts sometimes to a six thousandth part. The convertible pendulum appears liable to different sources of error, and though it may furnish an approximation to the determination of the terrestrial spheroid, it can hardly be ex¬ pected to reach the accuracy and certainty re¬ quisite for a metrical standard",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"The stream tide occurs at the interval of a day and a half after the conjunction or opposition, the lunar swell at first preceding the solar, but falling back at the next two returns, till at the third accession it combines with the latter. The decrease of consecutive tides is about a third faster at the conjunctions which happen in the equinox than at those in the solstice, and nearly twice as rapid at the quadratures that occur in the equinox as at those in the solstice. Similar consequences result from the alterations in the right ascension and the declination of the sun and moon. All these conclusions of a refined theory are singularly confirmed by a critical and very laborious examination of the observations made for a series of years at the port of Brest",Brest,FR,8,France,Europe
"The second sort of oscillations is occasioned by the diurnal change of the elevation and depres¬ sion of the sun; so that in midsummer, when the declination is greater, the stream tide at Brest rises seven inches higher in the morning than the following tide towards evening. This divaricating tide has no visible influence however on our shores; and to explain the equal swell of the waters during the day and the night, Laplace refers it to the retardation from a current of a certain uniform depth, which he estimated at DISSERTATION FIFTH","Brest, Laplace","FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"About this time Mayer of Wiirtemburg began to distinguish himself as one of the ablest and most ingenious astronomers that has appeared in any age. In 1751 he had been appointed di¬ rector of the observatory at Gottingen; and in this situation, encircled by foreign troops, and exposed to the danger of powder magazines, he yet laboured with such intense and enthusiastic ardour as to shorten his days. His efforts were mainly directed to the improvement of the Tables of the motions of the Sun and Moon. These elements he derived from a discussion of nu¬ merous observations of eclipses and occulta- tions, and he borrowed little from theory, though he preferred the arrangement of the elements adopted by Euler. He was the first who em¬ ployed the method of conditional equations to find the true values of the co-efficients. His Tables Were inserted in the Gottingen Trans¬ actions; and after the most sedulous correction, he sent them in 1755 to London, for the pa¬ tronage of the Board of Longitude. At his death in 1762 he left two copies, greatly im¬ proved, one of which his widow transmitted to that scientific body.

"Herschel, a musician residing at Bath, though a native of Hanover, which he had left in early youth, devoted his leisure to the construction and improvement of reflecting telescopes, Avith which he continued ardently to smwey the heaArens. His zeal and assiduity had already drawn the notice of astronomers, when he an¬ nounced to Dr Maskelyne, that, on the night of the 13th of March 1781, he observed a shifting star, which from its smallness he judged to he a Comet, though it was distinguished neither by a nebulosity nor a tail.

"This wonderful extension of the Solar System was chiefly due to the zeal and industry of the German and other confederated Astronomers, who, at the instance of the spirited Baron Zach, had divided the heavens into different sections, and occupied themseRes in surveying their several allotments. The catalogue of fixed stars was thus prodigiously augmented, and many peculiarities in their character and con¬ figuration detected. In the meanwhile Herschel, with the superior aid of his powerful reflecting telescopes, observed the numerous clusters of nebulosities, and distinguished many of the changing and double stars, which, though suns of other systems, yet appear connected, and may probably circulate about their common centre of gravity. Assuming that the instrument he used could enable him to penetrate 497 times farther than Sirius, he reckoned 116,000 stars to pass in a quarter of an hour over the field of view, which subtended an angle of only 15'.

"The periodical change of the inclination of the ecliptic is at last established, though the quantity of variation and the length of its cycle have not been absolutely determined. Schubert, in his treatise of Practical Astronomy, makes it to fluctuate between 18° and 29°, altering in the space of 65,000 years from 27° 45’ to 20° 43'; the maximum having occurred at the remote period of 36,300 years. But Delambre and Piazzi, whose judgment and scientific attainments rank much higher, have reduced this aberration with¬ in the moderate limits of 1° 20'. The greater obliquity of this ecliptic in ancient times, by elevating the sun more in summer, and depress¬ ing him in winter, must have proportionally in¬ creased the diversity of the seasons. But still the mean temperature of the earth has conti¬ nued for ages exactly the same; for the momen¬ tum of rotation at first impressed remaining ne¬ cessarily invariable, the smallest rise of heat, expanding the revolving mass, must have retard¬ ed its motion, and consequently lengthened somewhat the day. Any decrease of heat, on the contrary, would accelerate the terrestrial ro¬ tation. Now, the length of day has certainly not altered a single second of time since Hip¬ parchus observed eclipses 3000 years ago; and it therefore follows, that during this long period the mean temperature of the earth has not va¬ ried the fraction of a degree. The constant ac¬ cession of heat from the sun must hence be con¬ sumed by some process yet unexplored. Unless this heat were again to resume the form of light, it could not be darted from the upper atmo¬ sphere through the boundless void. Since the waters of the ocean are colder in proportion to their depth, might we not suppose the bottom to be frozen, and all the surplus heat to be ab¬ sorbed in melting the subaqueous ice ? Astronomical considerations likewise eluci¬ date the internal structure of our globe. The mean density of the mass is about double that of its exterior crust. But if the general materials were the same, and the law of compression sub¬ sisted in any degree, the resulting condensation would be inconceivably greater. Air compress¬ ed into the fiftieth part of its volume was lately found in France to have its elasticity fifty times augmented; and had it continued to contract at this rate, it would from its own incumbent weight have acquired the density of water at the depth of 34 miles. But water itself would have its density doubled at the depth of 93 miles, and even attain the density of quicksilver at a depth of 362 miles. In descending therefore towards the centre, through the space of about 4000 miles, the condensation of ordinary materials would surpass the utmost powers of conception. “ It seems therefore to follow conclusively, that our planet must have a very widely cavernous struc¬ ture, and that we tread on a crust or shell",,FR,8,France,Europe

There were, however, two or three notable excep¬ tions. One was the continued successful solution of the outstanding difficulties of the Theory of Gravity applied to the moon and planets, a task in which the continental mathematicians, and of these, in chief, Lagrange and Laplace, had no rivals, or even coad¬ jutors, on this side of the channel: Another was the foundation of Sidereal Astronomy by Sir William Herschel; and the last was the commencement of a system of Chemical Philosophy based on new and im¬ portant experiments, and including the laws of heat in combination with matter, which at that period very naturally ranged themselves within the province of the chemist.

Electricity, for instance, first statical, after¬ wards that of the pile, had a share in the discoveries and speculations of the time. But these were rather the mere extension of what had previously been thought of; or the first dawn of future important results, whose development fills a large space in the succeeding story",Laplace,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"

But the vast steps so recently made in Optics, in Electricity, in Magnetism, in Thermotics, and in Chemical principles, tended of necessity to call forth such an amount of laborious detail in the de¬ fining and connecting of facts and laws, and the de¬ ductions of the theories started to explain them, as seemed to render fresh and striking originality some¬ what hopeless, whilst they occasioned a vast amount of useful employment to minds of every order of ta- Optics. lent. The undulatory Theory of Light, nobly blocked out by the massive labours of Young and Fresnel, has afforded still unexhausted material to the ma¬ thematician on the one hand, and to the experimen¬ talist on the other; and ably have they fulfilled the double task, adding at the same time discoveries whose importance and difficulty would have made them still more prominent, had they not been the legitimate consequences of a still greater discovery already in our possession. Nearly the same might have been said for the sciences of Electricity, Electro¬ magnetism, and Electro-chemistry, had not the com- Electricity. parative newness of the whole doctrine of these sci¬ ences, and the suddenness of their first rise, and, per¬ haps still more, the appearance of a philosopher of the very highest merit, Mr Faraday, who fortunately at¬ tached himself to this special department, made the last thirty years an almost unbroken period of dis¬ covery. Radiant Heat, too, has been successfully advanced by labours comparable perhaps to those which marked its first rise as a science, and some other topics connected with heat have risen into great and practical consequence. Astronomy has been prosecuted with a systematic assiduity and suc¬ cess, especially at the British and Russian national observatories, which yields to that of no former pe¬ riod, whilst physical astronomy has been cultivated by methods of still improved analysis, and has achieved one triumph which France need not grudge to England, nor England to France,—so signal as to be placed by common consent in a position su¬ perior to any since the first publication of the theory of gravitation, more than a century and a half be¬ fore. This was the prediction of the position in space of a planet whose existence was unknown ex¬ cept by the disturbance which it produced in the Magnetism, movements of another. Terrestrial Magnetism has, for the first time, aspired to the rank of an exact science. In an illustrious philosopher of Germany, it has found its Kepler ; and the combination of na¬ tional efforts in collecting reliable data from the re¬ motest corners of the globe is characteristic of the Chemistry, practical energy of the age. Pure Chemistry has been cultivated with extraordinary assiduity; but though some general principles have emerged, none are comparable, from their importance, to the dis¬ covery of Dalton.

"One attempt—a bold and successful one—has (19.) been made, in our own day, to unite two of the Writings of tW departments,-! mean the History and the 1 nilosophy ot the Inductive Sciences. An English art Mill, philosopher of wonderful versatility, industry, and power has erected a permanent monument to his reputation in a voluminous work bearing the pre¬ ceding title.1 A slight inspection of that work will show how impracticable and self-destructive a plan it would have been to attempt anything like a syste¬ matic abridgment of such a mass of facts and specu¬ lations within our present limits. Mr J. Stuart Mill has also published a work bearing on the origin of our scientific knowledge, diametrically opposed in principle to the preceding one, yet marked by great ability.2 Such disquisitions belong more properly to the philosophy of the human mind than of phy¬ sics. After all, be it remembered that whatever has been learnt or discussed concerning the means of arriving at truth in Natural Science, it is not pre¬ tended that we have recently become possessed of any canons or rules of discovery superseding those fundamental principles of observation and experi¬ ment so well laid down by Bacon, and practised both present volume will bear an enduring testimony. Playfair’s original contributions to science were not so marked and consi- Character derable as to justify me in including his name in the comparatively brief catalogue of discoverers chronicled in the succeeding 0f Professor pages; but his efforts are nevertheless, deserving of notice, and indirectly were perhaps hardly less beneficial. He was a most Plavfair patient and admiring student of the greatest mathematical writers of his time, and, when we consider the singularly backward ' ^ state of that science in Great Britain about the end of the last and commencement of the present century, it was of no slight im¬ portance to find a, man placed in the position of a public instructor able and willing to direct attention to the splendid achieve- ments of the continental mathematicians. By his lectures both on Mathematics and Natural Philosophy—by his luminous articles in the Edinburgh Review—by some of his original papers in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh—be contributed to this useful end, and would have done so still farther had he been enabled to complete the Dissertation which he so ably com¬ menced. He had an excellent mathematical capacity, and mathematical taste, rather than £>ower. His explanations, even of matters of inherent difficulty, are perspicuous and popular, qualities possessed by few of his contemporaries. His style has been pronounced by the highest authorities to be a model of clearness and eloquence. He was extensively read in subjects of meta- p ysics and morals, as well as of pure science ; and by a combination of talent rare, I am inclined to say, in a high degree, his taste, though eminently mathematical, was also directed, with signal success (at first through his intimate friendship for Dr Hutton) to t. e very opposite studies of Geology and Physical Geography, which may be said to have been the subjects of his predilection during the last twenty years of his life. Nor were these labours of the closet merely; he was far more intimately versed in the mineral structure of the earth, from observation, than any except a few professed geologists; and he exceeded them all in the ability^with which he expounded and maintained the striking doctrines of the Huttonian theory. Though professedly the “ illus¬ trator of the principles specifically but obscurely laid down by Hutton, he certainly added much of his own. There is no rea¬ son to doubt that Playfair first apprehended the moving power of glaciers as geological agents in modifying the surface of Alpine countries, a matter which has of late been so earnestly discussed by the ablest geologists",Edinburgh,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"But as knowledge advances it extends in both directions towards speculation and towards practical applications, but most towards the applications. This Bacon well understood, and he has consistently main¬ tained, that knowledge, to be profitable to its cultiva¬ tors, must also be fruitful to mankind. And all the history of science since Bacon’s day has read this 1 I have borrowed but sparingly, in the following pages, from the existing compilations on the history of science. Indeed, a writer who intends to make a subject his own by a well-considered, fundamental plan of treating it, will use such works prin¬ cipally as a guide to his own further inquiries, and to assist him in selecting the topics worthy of fullest discussion. In this respect Dr Whewell’s excellent writings, already cited, have been of great use to me; and in the particular department of Astronomy, I have often referred to Mr Grant’s valuable History of that science, as well as to the writings of Delamhre, and the very elaborate Historical Essay by M. Gautier, on the problem of the Three Bodies, which is not, I think, noticed by Mr Grant, but which contains a most elaborate history of the researches of Lagrange and Laplace. In optics, I have consulted the systematic treatises of Dr Young, Sir D. Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Dr Lloyd, M. Moigno, and M. lladicke; and so of other subjects. Gehler’s Physikalisches Worterbuch, Fechner’s Repertorium, and that of Dove, afford a vast amount of historical infor¬ mation. The Transactions and Proceedings of the various societies, British and Foreign, have of course furnished a great part of my information. Such strictly biographical details as I have made use of, have in general been very carefully taken from the best accessible authority","Gautier, Laplace","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"(28.) These views are strikingly confirmed by the his¬ torical fact of the paucity of pare mathematicians, The pure and of distinct mathematical treatises of a strictly original character in an age distinguished by the diffusion of mathematical knowledge, and in countries (like France) most celebrated for its triumphs. There are not, perhaps, much more than half a dozen really great mathematicians of the last seventy years, who have not left treatises more numerous and more distinguished on physical science, treated mathe¬ matically, than on pure mathematics. Among the exceptions which more immediately occur, are Monge, Legendre, and Abel. And of distinct treatises, whilst we have the Mecanique Analytique, the Mecanique Cdleste, the Thdorie de la Chaleur, and numberless others, containing precious mathematical develop¬ ments, in connection with the applications which suggested them, the purely mathematical memoirs of the same period are to be sought chiefly in the form of detached essays, in the ponderous volumes of Academical Transactions",,FR,8,France,Europe
"The national pride of England in the triumphs of Newton impelled her ablest mathematicians to at¬ tempt to carry forward the synthetic methods which he had chiefly used, at least in his published works, to the more arduous and intricate questions of Me¬ chanics and Astronomy which presented themselves for solution in the course of the 18th century. Mac- laurin was almost the last Englishman of that period whose mathematical writings came into direct com¬ petition with the rising schools of Germany and France. The labours of Matthew Stewart, and Simpson were mostly geometrical; those of Landen and Waring, though profound, created little general impression; and, gradually, the extent and difficulty of the foreign mathematics, increased by the use of the Leibnitzian notation of differentials which was ab¬ solutely unfamiliar in England, deterred almost every one even from perusing the writings of Clairaut and D’Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace. Of the conti¬ nental mathematicians, Euler was probably the best known, owing to the lucidity of his writings and their eminently practical tendencies. Some idea may be formed of the negation of mathematical talent in Britain during the later portion of the last century, when we find D’Alembert declaring, in 1769, that if an Englishman is to be elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Academy of Sciences, he will vote for Earl Stanhope as the best mathemati¬ cian there, as he believes, not having read any of his works ! If the choice was to be free, he should prefer M. de Lagrange !

From this time the Avorks of foreign mathe¬ maticians began to be more generally read, particu¬ larly the Avritings of Laplace and Poisson; and Avithin ten or a dozen years subsequently, a few active and undaunted men, chiefly of the Cambridge school, such as Mr Airy and Sir John Lubbock, grappled with the outstanding difficulties of physical astronomy, whilst a larger number applied them¬ selves to the most difficult parts of pure analysis, and acquired great dexterity in its use in the solu¬ tion of geometrical and mechanical problems.

"2 Mr Duncan Gregory, a promising mathematician who died 23d February 1844, at the early age of 30, was the youngest Mr Duncan son of Dr James Gregory, the late distinguished Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh.

He was, in fact, the lineal descendant of the inventor of the reflecting telescope. Mr Gregory was the first editor of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, and author of an excellent book of Examples in the Differential and Integral Calculus, both of which have exercised a beneficial influence on the progress of science in England.

Some of the ellipses will elongate, whilst others tend to become circles; their planes will vary in inclination, but ultimately be stayed within the limit which human sagacity had predicted myriads of years before. “These,” says a French analyst, “are the pendulums of eternity, which beat ages whilst ours beat seconds.” And amidst all these variations, subject to law and to impass¬ able limits, the Major Axes of the orbits preserve a stedfast uniformity, or are subject only to transient fluctuations; and thus permanence arises in the midst of change, and the perfection of the system is demon¬ strated by the very nature of the disturbances which seemed at one time inevitably to limit its duration",,FR,8,France,Europe

The first class are inde¬ pendent of the earth’s rotation, and are practically insignificant. The second class includes the diurnal tide occurring once in about 24 hours. Concerning it, Laplace draws this conclusion, that its rise and fall (not, however, its horizontal motion) are insensible if the depth of the ocean is uniform ;a and being practi¬ cally insensible in most latitudes, we have thence an argument of more or less weight for a general tendency to uniformity in the depth of the sea. The third class of tides are the ordinary semi-diurnal tides. They afford, as Newton acutely perceived, the most direct and attainable measure of the relative at¬ tractions of the sun and moon. We have the sum of these attractions at the conjunctions and oppositions of the luminaries, and the difference when they are 90° apart; and a higher maximum when both bodies are without latitude. From the observation of the tides on the Severn near Bristol, Newton computed the relative action of the moon and sun to be as 4""48 to 1 ; but this value is much too great, and gave far too large a relative mass to the moon. The result in the harbour of Brest, from observations made under Laplace’s direction, is about 2-90 to 1; and the moon’s mass y^th that of the earth, agreeing almost identically with that deduced from the nutation of the earth’s axis caused by her attraction.

The tides of the Eastern Pacific are but little known ; but a vast wave advances northwards between Australia and Africa, diverted or retarded by the obstacles it meets with in the Indian Archi¬ pelago. Another (and to us the most important) branch sets from south to north up the vast canal of the Atlantic, where it is gradually complicated by local tides, having their origin in the wide expanse between Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. The two sets of waves sometimes reinforce, sometimes oppose, one another; they are prolonged to the western shores of England and Norway, where the tidal im¬ pulse arrives 24 hours after it passed the Cape of Good Hope. It is propagated most rapidly at a dis¬ tance from coasts, and is retarded in narrows and shallows. It sends offshoots into every bay and strait, always greatly retarded in point of time (ap¬ parently by friction), but often increased in elevation by concentration of the effect in a gradually narrow¬ ing channel, as we see in the exaggerated tides of the river Amazon, the Severn, and the Bay of Fundy","Newton, Severn, Bay","US,AU,MX,NO,PH",8,"United States,Australia,Mexico,Norway,Philippines","North America,Oceania,North America,Europe,Asia"

"The basis of this intricate doctrine was laid by Huy¬ gens ; Euler, in a celebrated and original work, gave it a general and analytical form ; D Alembert solved by it the problems of precession and nutation ; Laplace demonstrated the constancy of the time of the earth’s rotation round its axis. This last pro¬ blem was more fully discussed by Poisson, who showed by theory that neither can the earth ever rotate round an axis different from its present one, nor can the time of its rotation vary in consequence of any ex¬ ternal attractions to which it is subject.

"He at first, we believe, attached himself to chemis¬ try, but his taste for physical astronomy was soon developed, and was advanced entirely by his private efforts. It is a peculiarity of the mode of culti¬ vating the sciences in Paris, that such abstruse and difficult studies are not merely engaged in tem¬ porarily for purposes of academial distinction, but that they actually become a “ carriere” or calling, and are pursued in that methodical manner for which the French are distinguished. In 1845, when he com¬ menced the careful examination of the theory of Uranus, M. Leverrier was already favourably known by his researches on comets, and on the orbit of Mercury,but especially by immense calculations, con¬ nected with the secular inequalities of the planets, by which his ability and hardihood in computation had been thoroughly exercised. He began his new en¬ quiry with the method and intrepidity of calculation which distinguish him. He revised with the most minute care the observations of Uranus, and computed afresh every sensible perturbation which theory recognised as arising from known planets",Paris,"US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"M. Leverrier then assumed that a perturbing (134.) planet existed beyond the orbit of Uranus, and at nearly double its distance from the sun, in conformity with the empirical law, (usually attributed to Bode the German astronomer,) which expresses with gene¬ ral accuracy, thus far, the arrangement of the planetary system. The law is, that the distances of the planetary orbits from Mercury are successively doubled. This assumption—(it was absolutely necessary to assume some distance to begin with)—was ingeniously con¬ firmed by other considerations",,DE,8,Germany,Europe

Galle, then assistant-astro¬ nomer at Berlin, where a powerful refractor suitable for the search existed. So ardent a conviction in a manner compelled the proof which the geometer claimed, and M.

"“ During Maskelyne’s long tenure of office he was entirely devoted to its duties, making himself all the most delicate observations, particularly those of the moon, and rarely quitting the observatory except to attend the meetings of the Royal Society. The per¬ fect method and continuity of his observations give to them a great value, especially for the correction of the Lunar Tables, in which respect they are indeed without a parallel. But the regularity of their publication was not their least merit. Four large folio volumes include the patient labours of a life (for he had but one assistant). Delambre in his character of Maskelyne says, that if through some catastrophe the whole materials of science should be lost, except these volumes, they would suffice to re¬ construct entirely the edifice of modern astronomy.’,2 hisobser ^ac^’ on Maskelyne’s accession, the only methodi- vations at ca^ publication which had issued from Greenwich Greenwich. Observatory was the “ Historia Celestis” of Flam¬ steed ; Halley’s, Bradley’s, and Bliss’s observations remained in manuscript. A like fate attended most of the foreign astronomical observations ; labours the most irksome and conscientious lie buried in piles of MS. useless to science, and which therefore might almost as well have never been made. This is particularly the case with the Parisian observa¬ tions (as the impartial Delambre records with pain), commenced even before the time of Flamsteed ; but which, owing to this cause principally, have remained even to the present day (and it is forty years since Delambre wrote his patriotic protest) without con¬ tributing materially to advance astronomy. Let it then be recorded to the honour of Maskelyne, that this important step of regular and full publication at the public expense was entirely due to him. His places of the sun, moon, and planets, were the founda¬ tion of the improved theories of physical astronomy, then more ably cultivated on the Continent than in Britain, and of the tables also chiefly furnished by German and French computers",Bradley,"US,DE,FR",8,"United States,Germany,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The numerical result being (as the author himself admitted) without value, Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society in 1772 to repeat the observation on some British mountain. A “ Committee of Attrac¬ tion” was named, which, besides Maskelyne, included Cavendish, Franklin, and Horsley. Cavendish, as might have been expected, took an earnest part in it",Franklin,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"This is the proper place to mention an experiment (156.) on the density of the Earth perhaps still more re- Ml^hpI1ven markable, devised by the Rev. Mr Michell, who con- ^sh’sexpe- structed the apparatus, but first put in practice by riment for Mr Cavendish in 1797-8. It consisted in measuring the same the force of gravitation between two spheres of such end‘ small size that they could be moved by the hand nearer to or farther from one another. The essen¬ tial part of the invention was to contrive a balance so delicate as to measure the almost inappreciable tendency of such small bodies to unite. Newton had shown that the attraction at the surface of any sphere is directly as its radius, which he observed must always be incomparably smaller than their tendency towards the earth, that is, their weight. In the largest and heaviest masses with which it has hither¬ to been found practicable to operate, this tendency 1 De Mundi Systemate, § 22. Newton, in a very remarkable passage of the Third Book of the Principia (Prop. X.), con¬ jectures that “ the quantity of matter in the earth may be five or six times greater than if the whole were composed of water.” A laughable mistake of Zach in his account of the Schehallien experiment (in his Attraction des Montagues) is commented on by Playfair in the Edinburgh Review. In a note to the word Schehallien, Zach says, “ Montague appelee dans le pays en langue Erse Maiden pap, qui veut dire orage perpetuel.” It is needless to add that these two alleged synonyms are different in¬ terpretations given by Gaelic scholars of the word. “ From this inaccuracy,” adds his reviewer, “ his residence in London ought to have delivered him, for though he could not learn there what was Erse, he might have learned what was English.” 3 Zach obtained the same result exactly by including all the observations, as Maskelyne had provisionally obtained by using only those stars on which he most depended","Newton, Newton, London","US,GB,UK",8,"United States,United Kingdom,N/A","North America,Europe,N/A"
"(158.) It would be difficult to mention in the whole range y re* of physics a more beautiful and more important ex¬ periment. It has been repeated since by Reich of Freiberg and Baily of London. The former obtained 5'44, the latter 5-66 for the Earth’s specific gravity; this last result being worthy of much confidence from the extraordinary care taken to avoid errors and to obtain independent values of the quantities sought.1 Maskelyne continued his zeal for the promotion of astronomy to the last. He superintended the publi¬ cation of 45 annual volumes of the Nautical Alma¬ nac. He left the whole of the observatory work in perfect order, and the greater part printed. He had the well-earned satisfaction of finding his observa¬ tions in request in every civilized country, the bases of the most useful tables, and the tests of the most advanced theories. He cultivated the friendly cor¬ respondence of astronomers in every country. Not given to change, he preserved the instruments and chief methods of the immortal Bradley ; but suffi¬ ciently alive to the necessity of progress in the sciences, he introduced many simple but practical im¬ provements in the art of observation. Even in his last years, satisfied that the celebrated quadrant of Bird was no longer the best instrument for its pur¬ pose, and was besides sensibly deteriorated by use, he adopted the circle instead (then recently come into notice, though first used more than a century before by Rbmer), and directed the construction of that by Troughton, though it was not placed at Greenwich until after his death, which occurred in 1811, in the 79 th year of his age.

"In France, after the death of the celebrated La- caille, perhaps Lalande (who was exactly Maskelyne’s contemporary) was the most active astronomer. To him and his nephew we owe a very valuable catalogue of 50,000 stars, lately edited by the British Associa¬ tion. But practical astronomy was seriously neglect¬ ed in France generally. The national observatory was feebly superintended by the later members of the Cassini family; of the French expedition under Maupertuis to measure the length of a degree in Lap- land, the Abbe Outhier alone, it is said, knew how to use a quadrant, and the celebrated Lagrange was as ill informed until instructed by Lalande.1 But the most important labours of the French : astronomers at the close of the last, and at the com¬ mencement of the present century, were in carrying out the measurement of the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to the Balearic Isles, with the more imme¬ diate object of fixing the length of the metre, but con¬ tributing to the solution of far more considerable pro¬ blems connected with the figure of the earth. We connect this labour with the respectable name of De¬ lambre, who was more intimately associated with it than perhaps any other person, though united with such eminent men as Mechain, Biot, and Arago",,FR,8,France,Europe
"He was intimately conversant with all properly as¬ tronomical methods and formulae. He knew the his¬ tory of every problem, and the details and modifica¬ tions of every astronomical instrument. He has embodied the results of this vast industry in a series of works (forming six quarto volumes) on the his¬ tory of his favourite science, which are without a parallel for fulness and impartiality. He laboured as conscientiously to ascribe the due credit to Hip¬ parchus and Ptolemy as to hold an equal scale be¬ tween the merits of French and British astronomers",,"FR,GB",8,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"His critical knowledge of the ancient languages (for he could speak Greek with fluency) was not more re¬ markable than his complete freedom from national prejudices. Both attributes qualified him pre-emi¬ nently for the office of an historian. He published also a large treatise on astronomy, and numerous memoirs on practical subjects in the Connaissance des Terns between 1788 and 1817",,GR,8,Greece,Europe
"the most important. As some account of this un¬ dertaking has been given in Sir John Leslie’s Dis¬ sertation, I shall state concisely a few particulars not there mentioned. Not the least singular feature of this gigantic work was the political crisis under which it was conducted. So early as August 1790, the French Constituent Assembly, on the motion of Talleyrand, desired the king to write to the English government, to represent the advantage of the two nations uniting to adopt a common unit or standard of weight and measure, which it was proposed should be done by a joint committee of the Royal Society and the French Academy.2 This application was probably never made, at least nothing came of it; but the Academy named their own committee, who, after discussing three sorts of natural standards,— the length of the pendulum in lat. 45° (first proposed by Huygens in his Horologium Oscillatorium), the length of a quadrant of the equator, and that of a quadrant of the meridian from the equator to the pole assumed to be elliptic,—adopted the latter, and this labour was committed to Mechain for the southern part, from Rodez to Barcelona (170,000 toises), and to Delambre for the northern, trom Rodez to Dunkirk (380,000 toises). The southern arc was afterwards extended to Formentera in the Balearic Isles, and the whole length of the arc was found astronomically to be 12° 22' 12""-6. Two bases were measured (both by Delambre), one at Perpignan of 6006 toises, the other at Melun of 6076 toises (each about 7’3 miles). When the length of the for¬ mer was computed by triangulation from the latter, the difference of the observed and inferred amount is said to have been only ten or eleven inches","Rodez, Barcelona, Rodez, Perpignan, Melun","FR,VE,UK",8,"France,Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,N/A","Europe,South America,N/A"
"were the principal means of extricating him from his difficulties : hut his danger was often imminent, and he appears to have sometimes heard the dreadful words which, as an eloquent author has expressed it, were the last sounds that vibrated in the ear of many an unhappy victim.” The operations were actually sus¬ pended for a time hy a decree of Robespierre and his colleagues, who deposed Delambre, along with Laplace, Lavoisier, Borda, and others, from the Commission of Weights and Measures, as being deficient in “ re¬ publican virtues and their hatred of kings.” They were, however, resumed, and Delambre had finished his share of the work long before his colleague Me¬ chain, whose shorter task was conducted amidst a people rude and uneducated, indeed, yet far more to be trusted than were then those of the north. Me¬ chain was apparently wayward and impracticable, somewhat too aged for so great a work, yet a really good astronomer. The want of agreement to within 3"" of two sets of observations for latitude atBarcelona, the southern end of the arc at that time, led him to the suppression of one of them, and he was tormented ever after by the consciousness of the evasion, which deprived him of the tranquillity necessary to resume and complete his work, which was done chiefly by Delambre after vexatious delays.1 The error, which may be said to have cost Mechain his life, was pro¬ bably owing to the instrument employed on this sur¬ vey, the repeating circle of Borda, only fourteen inches diameter, with a rather weak telescope. The opinion generally entertained in Britain is, that the repeating circle was quite inadequate to the prodi¬ gious accuracy required of it, especially in the deter¬ mination of latitudes. The errors of mere division are often trivial compared to those inherent in other parts of an instrument. Of these a deficiency of op¬ tical power, and the want of absolute security of the clamps, upon which the entire success of the princi¬ ple of repetition depends, are amongst the most ob¬ vious. The arc was finally prolonged from Barcelona to Formentera by Biot and Arago in 1806. The conclusion of the survey was not destitute of the ad¬ venturous character of its commencement. The French astronomers ran many risks, underwent much suffering, and Arago narrowly escaped finishing his days in the dungeons of Spain","Laplace, Barcelona, Of, Barcelona","VE,ES,US,TR,FR",8,"Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of,Spain,United States,Turkey,France","South America,Europe,North America,Asia,Europe"
"The English survey carried on by Roy and Mudge has been also noticed in the previous Dissertation, The arc from Dunnose to Burleigh Moor amounts to 3° 57' 13""T, the measured length to 1442953 feet. An arc of parallel was also measured from Dover to Falmouth. We shall say something of its later progress in the concluding part of this essay, hut we have still to regret the postponed publication of the British Arc of the Meridian, which we have no reason to doubt will bear a favourable compari¬ son with the work of Delambre.

"By means of the former the spherical excess of terres¬ trial triangles was first observed as a fact. The results of the French and British arcs taken sepa¬ rately concuri’ed in showing a local curvature in this part of the world altogether anomalous, the de¬ grees rather shortening in the northern part of each arc. This fact, which must be imputed either to lai’ge local attractions, giving errors of several seconds in the determination of latitudes, or (less probably) to a local departure in our quarter of the world from the general or mean figure of the earth, sufficiently shows the futility of the proposed method of deter¬ mining a natural, recoverable standard of length",,"FR,GB",8,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"
"When combined with the measures of Bouguer in South America and Lambton in India, and the revised arc (measured in the beginning of this century) of Svanberg and Melanderhjelm in Lapland, the French and English measures give a general ellipticity some¬ what under 3^, which is probably as near the truth as local inequalities admit of the determination being made",,"IN,FR,UK",8,"India,France,N/A","Asia,Europe,N/A"
"As an acknowledgment of his merit, the highest indeed in their power to bestow, the Institute of France decreed to him in 1810 one of the Decennial Prizes instituted by Napoleon. But the Emperor, though professing to be the warm encourager of science, suffered some meaner motive to interfere, and refused to ratify the decision. “ Ce fut,” writes Dupin, “ un pas dans la route qui le menait a sa chute.” After the siege of Paris in 1814 Delambre wrote a characteristic letter to his friend Moll. The tranquil spirit which had braved the horrors of the Re¬ volution was not to be moved by the sounds of the artillery of the allied armies. In spite of the can¬ nonade which he heard from his library, he laboured from eight in the morning until midnight; and, con¬ scious of rectitude, he feared little the revolution of circumstances, which changing dynasties might call forth. “ Labour,” he says, “ occupies all my time and all my faculties.” As Secretary to the Academy of Sciences for the (168.)

"Amongst these, the discoveries of Sir William Her¬ schel occupy perhaps the foremost place. Arago has affirmed that Slough is the spot on the earth’s sur¬ face signalized by the most numerous discoveries, and in a certain sense this is strictly true. No one, before or since (with possibly the exception of Mr Hind) has added so many new bodies to the known planetary system, and this at a time when such discoveries were rarer, more unexpected, and more difficult than now. His researches on the fixed stars are not of a nature to have their importance numerically estimated",Slough,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"England cannot claim Herschel as her own, except by adoption. He was born at Hanover in 1738, and was one of a numerous family who supported them¬ selves chiefly by their musical talents. William Herschel, the third son, came to England in 1759 with his elder brother, and after struggling with many difficulties, found himself in comparatively comfort¬ able circumstances as an organist at Bath. In 1774 he had executed a reflecting telescope with his own hands, and soon acquired so much dexterity as to construct instruments of ten and twenty feet in focal length. In 1780 he contributed his first paper on the variable star in Cetus to the Royal Society, and the following year (13th March 1781) discovered the erratic body, which he at first took for a comet, but which proved to be a planet exterior to Saturn; the first addition therefore to the number of the primary planets since a period of an immemorial antiquity","Hanover, Bath, March","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"To construct good telescopes is itself no easy art, especially if they are to be carried to a size and per¬ fection previoiisly unattained. To ascertain the best composition, whether of glass or metal, to melt and to cast it in the right way, is one branch of the art which may be called generally the chemical part. To fashion the lens or mirror correctly by grinding, and to fit it for optical use by giving it an exquisite polish, is a second step requiring a peculiar mechanical skill and perseverance. To mount the telescope effec¬ tively is another and entirely different problem in mechanics; and all these the amateur astronomer must be prepared to accomplish with his own hands, unless he command the services of practical opticians to an extent rarely to be bought. Amateurs have indeed seldom succeeded except with reflecting in¬ struments, and Herschel acted very wisely in devot¬ ing himself to their improvement at a time when the success of Dollond with achromatic telescopes had rendered the Newtonian form unfashionable. The real secret of Herschel’s success was his astonishing perseverance; his determination was to obtain tele¬ scopes of twenty feet focal length or more, and of a perfection equal or superior to that of the small ones then in use. He himself relates, that whilst at Bath he had constructed 200 specula of seven feet focus, 150 of ten feet, and about 80 of twenty feet; a proof of extraordinary resolution in a man of limited means and engaged in a laborious profession. By making so great a number he could select those having the most perfect figure, especially before he had con¬ trived a method of obtaining mechanically a para¬ bolic form, almost with certainty. This method was not divulged. He was justified in keeping his secret, whilst he made a handsome income from the manu¬ facture of telescopes for sale. Lord Rosse and Mr Lassell have had the merit of publishing their methods, which by their results would appear to be at least equal to Herschel’s",Bath,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"4 the atmosphere, especially in these climates, impose a speedy limit to the increase of magnifying power, unless in exceptional circumstances. The same ob¬ jections do not apply to the increased aperture and illuminating power of telescopes. This con¬ sideration induced Herschel to construct his forty- feet reflector, the funds being advanced by the king, on the recommendation of the Royal Society. The speculum had a useful surface precisely four feet in diameter, the thickness three and a half inches, the weight when cast above 2000 pounds. The second or plane mirror having been dispensed with, the image was thrown to one side of the object-end of the tube bv means of a very slight inclination of the speculum, and was there observed directly by a common eye-piece or single lens, the observer being thus stationed with his back to the object he is viewing. This vast in¬ strument collected a cone of rays from a distant point between six and seven times larger than the twenty- feet instrument commonly employed by Sir W. Her¬ schel, of which the aperture was 18-8 inches. This telescope was not frequently used, partly from the rarity of sufficiently steady weather, and from the difficulty of preserving the figure of the mirror under changes of temperature.1 Its figure was also affected by flexure under its own enormous Aveight, and it has been found one of the greatest difficulties by those who have followed Herschel’s steps to avoid this source of error. The forty-feet speculum has been religiously preserved by the filial care of Sir John Her¬ schel, in whose possession the writer of these pages had the pleasure of seeing it, now many years since, in a state of high polish. It remains in a deposit hermetically closed, at Slough.2 (182.) Herschel made an ingenious determination of what negating- called the space-penetrating-power of telescopes, by power of which he discriminated the relative distances at which telescopes. a given fixed star would become invisible in his several instruments. It was grounded on the as¬ sumption that the visibility of the object depends, first, on the density of its light reaching the eye, and secondly, on the number of rays of that density concentrated in the image. The former quantity varies inversely as the square of the given distance, the latter directly as the square of the aperture of the telescope; the limiting visible distance therefore of the radiant body will be simply as the aperture",Slough,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"ably in the Milky Way, and which may in some sense be almost said to compose it—are the parent-matter of stars, whilst stars abound in their neighbour¬ hood, or seem partly to compose them, in a state of incredible aggregation. That the mass of sidereal matter composing the Milky Way (which forms an irregular girdle round the whole heavens1) has some special reference in its locality to our solar system, was also an early idea, which, towards the middle of the 18th century, had attained to something like a definite speculation in the minds of Kant, Lambert, and other philosophers, chiefly those of Germany",Kant,"DE,KG",8,"Germany,Kyrgyzstan","Europe,Asia"
"I do not know whether Sir W. Herschel derived his first ideas on the subject either from English or German authors. His customary silence (which is to be regretted) on the history of his discoveries, leaves us in doubt of his originality. Be this as it may, he proceeded to test the reasonableness of the speculation, in that definite and thorough manner which was very characteristic of his genius. He pro¬ ceeded to number the stars after a fashion which, if the early attempt of Hipparchus was pronounced in its day impious, might well have been accounted, even in Herschel’s age, impossible. To use his own bold expression, he gauged the heavens, by counting the whole number of stars visible in the field of his 20-feet reflector as many times as possible, and in every region of the sky which was visible from Slough, distinguishing the results of each region. As it was impossible in one lifetime to accomplish the en¬ tire survey (for the complete sphere contains 883,000 fields of 15' each in diameter), he took an average for each region, and thus determined the general popula¬ tion of the sky in all directions. The result more than confirmed the suspicions of Wright and Lambert, and demonstrated a remarkable, and, on the whole, a steady law of decrease, from the central zone of the Milky Way in opposite directions, until we reach two poles, one in the Southern, the other in the Northern hemisphere, which are the localities poorest in stars","Slough, Wright","GB,US,UK,DE",8,"United Kingdom,United States,N/A,Germany","Europe,North America,N/A,Europe"
"It was only whilst correcting the proofs of these sheets (1855) that I saw for the first time a memoir by Professor Encke in the Astronomische Nachrichten, vol. xxvi., No, 622 (published in 1848), maintaining the same view of the invalidity of M. Struve’s reasoning, and questioning the hypotheses (of which M. Encke reckons/ve) tacitly assumed by him. The Dutch Academy of Sciences (Haarlem) has proposed the points at issue between MM.

"There has been a great improvement in instruments and in the methods of using them. But there has been an incomparably greater advance in the methods of ex¬ tracting trustworthy results from observations made with due care. The art of dividing instruments wTas carried to great perfection in Great Britain by Graham and Bird, but their preference of the quadrant to in¬ struments of a circular form (introduced long before by Romer) retarded the progress of astronomy. Fo¬ reign observatories in the early part of this century (as in the last) sought their divided instruments from London ; Piazzi and Bessel worked with English circles. Troughton was as an artist the worthy suc¬ cessor of Ramsden; and even to the present time British astronomers, at least, do not admit that the nice contrivances and beautiful workmanship of Rep- sold and of Merz in Germany, or of Gambey in France, have produced instruments worthy of more confidence than those which have been constructed at home. In the improvement of object-glasses for telescopes, however, Germany and France bear away the palm, although for many years Dollond supplied Europe with his achromatic telescopes. With regard to constancy and fidelity of observation, whether in fixed observatories or in maritime and geographical expe¬ ditions, English astronomers have never been back¬ ward ; and the reputation of Greenwich Observatory in this respect (and also in the punctuality of pub¬ lication) has, as we have stated elsewhere, earned the approbation and gratitude of all Europe","Graham, London","DE,FR,GB,UK,US",8,"Germany,France,United Kingdom,N/A,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,N/A,North America"

"This improvement (though, as wTe shall see, already partially practised even in England) was mainly due to Bessel, whose name we have placed first at the head of this section. But astronomy owes to him much more than this. He first showed that it is part of an intelligent astronomer’s duty, not only to observe stars and planets, hut to undergo the vastly greater labour of comparing his results with the best theories of his time, and of improving as far as possible those theories, so as to hand over each branch of science to his successor in a more perfect state than that in which he found it. In all these respects practical astronomy commenced a new epoch in. Germany, and on this account principally we place the name of Bessel in a conspicuous rank",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"(221.) Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel was horn at Minden Bes®el~his on the 22d July 1784. He wras destined for a mer- boara.^ cantile career; and it is an interesting fact that it was the expectation of an appointment as supercargo on a commercial voyage which led him to study naviga¬ tion and astronomy, and finally induced him to de¬ vote his entire energies to the latter science, in which he received every encouragement from the amiable Gi¬ bers, who fortunately inhabited Bremen, where young Bessel was engaged in business. He commenced his astronomical career hy reducing Harriott’s observa¬ tions of the comet of 1607, and was thereafter ap¬ pointed assistant to Schrdter at the observatory of Lilienthal. In 1810 he was removed by the Prussian government to the charge of the observatory about to he erected at Konigsherg, where he spent the re¬ mainder of his life, and which he very speedily raised hy his labours to almost the first rank of European observatories. In fact, he possessed, in a singular degree, the qualifications for directing a great obser¬ vatory ; including a thorough acquaintance with the use of instruments, with the theory of astronomy in all its branches, with the higher mathematics, and also the art and practice of calculation, as well as with many allied branches of natural philosophy","Minden, Bremen, Lilienthal",DE,8,Germany,Europe
"Besides all this, the grand points of reference in the sky, the Pole and the line of Equinoxes, are undergoing perpetual, though small, changes of po¬ sition :—the first star of Aries had already, in the time of Hipparchus, wandered from the point of in¬ tersection of the Equator and Ecliptic;—consequently, longitudes and right ascensions have to be reckoned from a directional line in space altogether imaginary",,PL,8,Poland,Europe
"Of the subsequent labours of Bessel we must speak ' very shortly. The determination of the parallax of the star called 61 Cygni, perhaps the most original and important of these, we shall refer to another sec¬ tion, where we shall compare it with the results ob¬ tained by other astronomers. He made interesting physical observations on Halley’s comet at its return in 1835; he prepared the materials for a very ex¬ tended catalogue of fixed stars, arranged in zones, more recently published by Professor Weisse. In connection with the theory of the pendulum as a measure of gravity, he repeated and extended Newton’s important experiments on the uniformity of the gra¬ vitating force on all kinds of matter ; he applied a new correction to the vibrations of the pendulum, and improved the method of observing them correctly; and he discussed with his habitual mathematical skill and elaborate perseverance the figure of the Earth, from the whole of the then existing' observations; whilst he also directed an operation for connecting the Russian triangulations with those of western Europe,—a delicate task, which he performed with consummate skill. It will thus be seen that (without mentioning a host of minor works and memoirs) there was hardly a great department of Astronomy in which Bessel did not take a distinguished part. Even the discovery of Neptune, by calculation from the irregu¬ larities of Uranus, was contemplated as a practicable problem by the veteran astronomer in his later years","Of, Newton","TR,US,RU",8,"Turkey,United States,Russian Federation","Asia,North America,Europe"

"A meridian circle (combining in effect a mural circle and transit instrument) has been erected, of great size and optical power (6 feet circle and 8|- inch object- glass). But the novelty of the apparatus is its great weight and strength. Hitherto artists and astro¬ nomers have sought to avoid the evils of unsteadi¬ ness and flexure principally by the elaborate framing and trussing of light materials (chiefly brass tubes), and (in Germany especially) by an elaborate system of counterpoises. The new Greenwich circular in¬ strument is constructed of as few pieces as possible, of great strength and weight, and in great part of cast iron. The whole was elaborated and prepared for dividing in an engineering workshop, and with the powerful and accurate tools which modern engi¬ neers use. A man might stand upon the axis with¬ out producing the smallest bad effect. It is under¬ stood that the result is perfectly satisfactory as to steadiness and stiffness. Mr Airy has likewise in¬ vented and erected a new and most ingenious zenith tube (acting by reflection) for ascertaining the place of y Draconis, a star which, at its superior culmination, crosses the meridian of Greenwich almost in the zenith",,DE,8,Germany,Europe

Some of the observations of the eight¬ eenth century, especially those of Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope and of Phipps in the Arctic Regions, appear to have been made with much care ; but the French astronomer Borda seems to have given the initiative to observations of a higher degree of accuracy, and his methods were ably carried out in connection with the great French meridian arc, by M. Biot, who even extended his stations to the Island of Unst in Shetland",Shetland,"FR,GB",8,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"

Jean Charles Borda, who was born in 1733 and ^rove's The was devoted to the promotion of the method of exac^ sciences, and contributed in an eminent degree making to the precision attained in physics and astronomy them. towards the close of the last century. The name of Borda deserves a record in the history of science, since it has been said of him, by no less an authority than Dr Young, that “ he seems to have possessed a considerable share of that natural tact and sagacity which was so remarkable in Newton.” His earlier researches were connected with hydrodynamics, and the resisted motion of projectiles; in later years he was chiefly devoted to practical astronomy and geo¬ desy. The portable repeating circle invented by him has had a very great reputation in France. He was one of the principal designers of the measurement of the French arc, and was employed in its superin¬ tendence, especially as regards the measurement of the base. His experiments on the pendulum were originally undertaken (I believe) in 1790, with a view to making it the basis of the national measures, hut were afterwards subordinated to the greater scheme of terrestrial measurement. Baily records a fact connected with Borda, not unworthy of mention, as a caution to observers :—the year in which many of his experiments were made is not discoverable from the account of them, though the day, hour, minute, and second, are recorded with praiseworthy fidelity",Newton,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"(242.) Francis Baily; his early history and Baily. As regards the determination of the Earth’s figure, the relative length of a pendulum vi¬ brating seconds in different latitudes is all that is re¬ quired ; but the absolute length in a given place is necessary for finding the force of gravity there ex¬ pressed by the acceleration of falling bodies in vacuo in one second ; and as the British standard yard was at that time made to depend on the length of the pen¬ dulum vibrating seconds at London, this enquiry was mixed up with the intricate one of National Standard Measures",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"Francis Baily, who was born 28th April 1774, and who died 30th August 1844, was an instance of a person not endowed with extraordinary talents, yet of singular use in his generation. Those who knew Mr Baily personally, and what he accomplished for Astro¬ nomy, are best aware how rare and yet how estimable are such qualifications as his. Born of parents of a middle rank of life, educated at a country school, and at an early age thrown into the vortex of commer¬ cial life in the city of London, no probability could have appeared more remote than that he should ac¬ quire the respect of even the most accomplished As¬ tronomers by his scientific acquirements and perform¬ ances. He enjoyed the advantage, in the first place, of a perfectly sound and uninterrupted state of health until his 70th year. His intellect partook of the equable tone of his bodily powers. Method, and an andcharac- ardour which, instead of acting by impulses, seemedter* inexhaustible and unvaried, were the secrets of his success. Mr Baily never was hurried, and he never was unemployed. He had always leisure to encourage men of like tastes, and he was never unwilling to learn from any one who had knowledge to communicate","Born, London","NL,GB",8,"Netherlands,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"

"But Colonel Everest, whose conscientious anxiety reached almost a nervous pitch, seems not to have been satisfied with any one instrument which the mechanicians of London could produce ; but to have metamorphosed most of them, partly with his own hands, partly by native aid. It says much for his ability in this respect, that the results appear entitled to compete with ail the most exquisite of the kind in Europe. His bases, for instance, about 7i| miles in length, when checked by intermediate trian¬ gulation above 400 miles in extent, differed in one instance by 4, in another by 7 inches from the pri¬ mary measurement. The whole extent of Lambton’s and Colonel Everest’s operations includes a continu¬ ous arc of 21° 21' (1477 miles), by far the greatest at that time executed",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

It is indeed only rivalled in this respect by a vast Russian arc operation very lately executed in Russia and other ^ northern countries of Europe, by which an arc of 25° 20', extending from the banks of the Danube to the shores of the Arctic Sea, near the North Cape, has been measured under the general superintendence and direction of that able astronomer M. Struve, whose meritorious labours in other departments of astronomy will be specified in a succeeding section",,RU,8,Russian Federation,Europe

Struve, has since 1816 directed the whole operation. The whole line is remarkably free from con¬ siderable inequalities of ground, and from mountain ranges, so that local attractions are probably incon¬ siderable.1 On the other hand, extensive forests ex¬ tending over dead flats have, in the southern part of the arc (as in India), occasioned great difficulties, and compelled the erection of numerous temporary struc¬ tures to overlook the country. In the north the extraordinary refractions have, as usual, created some difficulties. Ten different base lines, all at a small height above the sea, form part of the operations",,"RU,IN,SE,NO",8,"Russian Federation,India,Sweden,Norway","Europe,Asia,Europe,Europe"
"It is a very satisfactory circumstance, that by the care of M. Struve and Mr Airy, the standards of length used in the Indian and Russian arcs have been directly compared",,"IN,RU",8,"India,Russian Federation","Asia,Europe"
"The calculation of the figure of the earth from the (256.) completed Russian arc, in combination with others, General re- has not yet been made, but it is believed that it ^» will indicate an ellipticity somewhat greater than ellipticity that generally received. The results obtained by Co- from geo- lonel Everest, on the other hand, by comparing hisdesyj arc with those of Europe, give generally small ellip- ticities, that is under The French and Indian arcs, for instance, give 3^.

Suppose a considerable weight suspended by a wire demon- of regular elasticity from a fixed point or stand con- f6nected firmly with the ground; and let us first ima- tation. g'ine tbe place ot the experiment to be exactly over the North Pole. Let the wire pendulum be swung so as to coincide with the plane of the meridian of London. As the earth rotates, the wire and the ball must evidently rotate too. But the motion of the mass originally impressed parallel to a given plane will continue in that plane, and consequently the plane of motion will coincide in the course of 12 hours with every meridian in succession, and the apparent rotation will be entirely completed in a uniform man¬ ner in 24 hours. In any other latitude than 90°, but greater than 0°, a continuous and regular appa¬ rent change of motion must also occur, since a me¬ ridian of the globe does not preserve its parallelism during diurnal motion, excepting only at the equator; consequently, at all points of the earth’s surface, ex¬ cept at the equator, the plane of motion of the pendu¬ lum will vary uniformly in azimuth—quicker, how¬ ever, in high than in low latitudes. To find this velocity, it is only necessary to decompose the rota¬ tion of the earth round its axis into two, one of which (which is alone effective) is round the vertical of the place of observation. The apparent angular motion is thus proportional to the sine of the angle of lati¬ tude. Thus, in an hour, it is 15° x sine lat",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"(265.) At its return in 1835, this Comet was watched in91835™ May 1936, and in the course of its long visibi¬ lity was made the subject of minute and admirable telescopic researches, by Bessel in Europe, and by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope. Their observations strictly confirmed a remark of M. Valz, that the Tails of Comets, though evidently generated under the influence of the neighbourhood of the Sun, yet commonly disappear at the period of closest ap¬ proach. This, at least, was the case with Halley’s Comet. The tail began to grow on the 2d October, two months after its discovery, and diminished after the 15th (a month before perihelion). The cometre- appeared in the end of January without any vestige of a tail, and then dilated in absolute bulk with in¬ credible quickness. But before its final disappear¬ ance, on the 5th May, the tail is supposed to have Its peculiar teen reabsorbed into the nucleus, which presented features, then a uniform circular outline. The evolution of the highly-expansible luminous matter of the tail took place from the nucleus in luminous fan-like jets, directed on the whole towards the Sun, and issuing on the side of the Comet exposed to that body. The jets had a vibratory motion. The tail (directed/row the Sun) was formed by the abrupt inflexion of these effluent jets, in a manner resem¬ bling electrical repulsion; and Sir John Herschel has not hesitated to ascribe the phenomenon to the com¬ bination of a repulsive force as respects the Sun, (“ of an energy very far exceeding the gravitating force towards that luminary”) with “ a peculiar and highly energetic attraction to the nucleus, differing from, and exceptional to, the ordinary power of gravita¬ tion.”1 The opinion that polar forces resembling magnetism or electricity are necessary to explain the phenomena of Comets, has been for some time cur¬ rent in Germany, and received, I believe, the coun¬ tenance of Bessel. That there exist in the movements of these bodies anomalies so great as to render the sufficiency and completeness of the Theory of Gravity suspected by such high authorities, makes the state¬ ment of them very important, though I confess a great reluctance to share in the conclusion",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"(273.) Nevertheless, the theory of a resisting medium in and still space is not perhaps very popular, except in England, questioned. Although M. de Humboldt appears to favour it, I understand that the German astronomers in general scarcely regard it as in any degree proved",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"(274.) Yet, if not true, the cardinal fact remains unex¬ plained. The anomalous phenomena of the Tails of Comets, considered by Herschel to be altogether inex¬ plicable by the law of gravity, demand the closest scrutiny ; and one can hardly help supposing that the two difficulties may be in close connection. As the Newtonian law is now considered (since the dis¬ covery of Neptune, and the latest corrections of the Lunar Tables) to be absolutely sufficient to account for everything connected with planetary motion, the Astronomy of Comets will be looked to with increas¬ ing interest, as likely to reveal some laws of nature not otherwise to be detected. In this respect, Pro¬ fessor Encke’s labours are likely to be more and more important in their results, (275.) With reference to this very eminent astronomer, M. Encke we have only to add, that he has for a great many bationsUr"" years ^ecn at °f the Observatory at Berlin, and in that capacity has published an Astronomical Ephemeris of first-rate excellence. It is as a phy¬ sical astronomer, however, that he will be principally remembered. Besides his admirable investigations connected with the Comet, he improved the theory of Vesta, and has very lately published a new Method of Computing Perturbations, especially for orbits con¬ siderably elliptical. Neptune was discovered at his Observatory, by the assistant astronomer, M. Galle","Berlin, Galle","DE,LK",8,"Germany,Sri Lanka","Europe,Asia"
"G-ambart's and Biela's Comet.—Jean Gambart, (276.) one of the most promising astronomers in France, died of consumption at a comparatively early age, I believe ^metre a 8 in 1836. He was director of the Observatory at Mar¬ seilles, which, notwithstanding its very unfavourable position in the midst of the town, has acquired con¬ siderable celebrity as regards the discovery and obser¬ vation of Comets. Pons, by whom Encke’s Comet was found, both in 1805 and 1818, conducted the Ob¬ servatory ; but its mounting was as bad as its situa¬ tion, and Pons used despairingly to describe his tele¬ scope as rather 'paralytic than parallactic. To this crippled establishment M. Gambart succeeded, and by his skill in managing his defective instruments, and by his patience in sweeping for Comets, he discovered and subsequently computed the orbits of a number of these bodies between 1822 and the period of his death",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Gambart was highly esteemed, both by French and foreign Astronomers. Pons also deserves great credit for his extraordinary diligence in the discovery of Comets, and M. Valz, who still directs the Obser¬ vatory of Marseilles has cultivated this and other branches of the science with success",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Gambart’s most remarkable discovery was the pe- (277.) riodicity of the first Comet of 1826, having detected Periodicity that body independently at Marseilles, though it hadin Gf yeais> been observed some days previously in Bohemia, by Biela, an officer in the Austrian service. It is most usually called Biela’s Comet, though it might with equal right be termed Gambart’s, who assigned its path and predicted its return. Clausen, about the same time with Gambart, assigned it a period of about 7 years ; and it was identified with former appear¬ ances in 1772 and 1805-6. Its period thus appeared to be 2460 days, or 6f years ; its aphelion is a little exterior to Jupiter’s orbit, and its perihelion is not much within the Earth’s. This Comet’s orbit very nearly intersects in one place the orbit of the Earth, so that had the earth been one month forwarder in its annual course in 1832, a collision would have taken place, or at least the Earth would have been enveloped in a cometary haze; for it is difficult to imagine a collision Avith a body whose tenuity is so excessive, that Sir John Herschel perceived through its entire thickness (estimated at 50,000 miles) stars of the most excessive minuteness (16th or 17th mag¬ nitude) as seen by his 20-feet reflector. It is an in¬ teresting circumstance, that the first predicted peri¬ helion passage, in 1832, took place within some hours of the time fixed by MM.

"Great Comets of 1811 and 1843.—The finest comets of the last hundred years were those of 1811 and 1843. The former was observed for a length of time altogether unusual, having been visible from March 1811 to August 1812. There is pretty good reason to think that its period is not much less than 3000 years. The comet of 1843 was even more splendid, but its flight was more rapid, and it was not favourably seen in northern latitudes. It was visible at many places in broad daylight when less than 4° from the Sun, and at one time a tail 65° in length could be traced. The circumstance which distinguishes this comet from all others which have been computed is the smallness of its perihelion dis¬ tance, which was only of the radius of the Earth’s orbit, or the comet approached the Sun’s body within one-seventh of his radius. The solar disk then sub¬ tended an angle at the comet of 121^-°, or the glare was equal to that of 47,000 suns as seen by us ! The heat to which the comet was exposed is supposed to have exceeded 24 times that concentrated by our most powerful burning-glasses by which even rock crystal has been fused.2 Mr Hind.—Discovery of New Planets.—We have ",March,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"Among the discoverers of these planetary bodies Mr Hind has been distinguished by frequent success, under circumstances which appeared by no means peculiarly advantageous.

The speculum was worked and polished by machinery con¬ structed by Mr Nasmyth, but principally devised by Mr Lassell, after he had examined and tried Lord Rosse’s method. I should think it must be admitted to be the most perfect optical work of its kind ever made: for I believe there is no test object in existence which Mr Lassell has not seen with it; in fact he has discovered the most delicate tests himself,—the 6th star of the group 6 Orionis (though not first seen by him), a satellite of Neptune, an eighth satellite of Saturn, and several satellites of Uranus",Liverpool,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"Till 1848 only seven satellites of Saturn were ad- (287.) mitted. The two closest to the planet were detected and one of by Sir William Herschel in 1789, and have beenSaturn* seen by very few astronomers since. During five years1 residence at the Cape, Sir John Herschel never but once obtained even a doubtful glimpse of the closest with an 18-inch mirror. The third, fourth, and fifth were discovered by Cassini in 1684; the sixth and most conspicuous by Huygens in 1654 : the outermost by Cassini in 1671. To these an eighth satellite, intermediate in position between the two last, was added by Mr Lassell on the 19th September 1848. By a singular coincidence, it was recognised as a satellite the very same evening by Mr Bond of Cambridge (in America) with the great Munich re¬ fractor. The new body was called Hyperion, in con¬ formity with Sir John Herschel’s suggestion of distin¬ guishing the satellites as well as the planets by mytho¬ logical names. On the 22d November 1850 Mr Las¬ sell saw at once Saturn with his whole train of eight satellites—a glorious spectacle probably enjoyed by no other astronomer.

It is also worthy of notice that the manufacture has pros¬ pered more in the hands of amateurs than of regular opticians. Sir William Herschel appeared at one time to have brought the invention to its highest per¬ fection, but the Earl of Rosse has made an important step farther ; not only by constructing a larger tele¬ scope than had been made before, but by adapting machinery driven by steam power, to the grinding and polishing of the mirror ; so that the largest speculum may be finished with nearly the same ac¬ curacy and expedition as the smallest.

The statical part of mechanics had made more progress. Masonry and Carpentry had attained a degree of perfection in many respects admirable, under the Italian and Norman architects ; but the really difficult theory of machinery in motion was little understood before Watt’s day, and the knowledge which then existed was unassociated with practical skill or commercial enterprize. It could be found only in profound treatises of theoretical mechanics, and in experimental courses of natural philosophy.

"was, however, to a great extent made up for by the tory, intelligent spirit with which he acquired knowledge without assistance on a great variety of subjects. At the age of nineteen he proceeded to London, w'here he learned mathematical-instrument making, but he soon returned to Scotland, intending to pursue that business in Glasgow. Here he met with obstacles, but finally, by the patronage of Dr Adam Smith, Dr Black, and other professors, he was established as instrument-maker to the university within the college buildings. I mention these details because they show that Watt, as early at least as 1757, had been favour¬ ably noticed by the most celebrated professors then in Glasgow, and had received a special pledge of their good will.3 It is evident that the professors of Che- 1 Lectures, i., 181. 2 Speech at Freemasons’ Hall, preserved in Arago’s Eloge of Watt, and in Davy’s Works, vol. vii","London, Glasgow, Glasgow",GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"867 andconnec-mistry and Natural Philosophy (Dr Black and Dr D^Black ^c^)’ obtained for him his appointment, must have been also his chief academical employers; and we may safely conclude that Watt constructed much of Dr Black’s apparatus, as he was certainly admitted to intimate and confidential intercourse with that great and amiable man. Dr Black removed to Edinburgh in 1766, but the friendship which he had extended to the young mechanic remained unaltered during their joint lives, although their personal in¬ tercourse must have been extremely slight after that time. Now Watt’s first thought of improving the steam-engine dates (as we shall see) from the session 1763-4, the last hut one of Black’s stay in Glasgow ; their intimacy was therefore fully established by that time ; and we find Watt acknowledging his “ obliga¬ tions to him for the information received from his conversation, and particularly for the knowledge of the doctrine of latent heat;”1 and we also find that during Watt's experiments on steam subsequent to the last-mentioned date, Black was cognizant of them, and assisted in their contrivance.2 Moreover, Watt admits Dr Cullen’s well-known experiment of redu¬ cing the temperature of ebullition under the air-pump to have been one of his starting points in the im¬ provement of the steam-engine.3 Yet this experiment was not 'published until 1770,4 and Watt must have heard of it from Black himself, or from some one attending his lectures, whei’e the fact was almost cer¬ tainly mentioned. Whether formally & student of Dr Black’s chemistry class or not, it is therefore evident that Watt enjoyed advantages in the prosecution of experimental physics which nineteen-twentieths of enrolled students never attain. He had the privilege of unreserved personal intercourse, amounting at last to intimate friendship, with the first authority of the last century on the subject of Heat, and one of the most cautious and accomplished of inductive philo¬ sophers.5 Watt’s eminent merits, and doubtless his merits alone, gained him this happy position ; but had he remained either at Greenock, or with the op¬ tician in Cornhill, he might have failed to combine so admirably as he did the character of the practical man and the philosopher. His place in science was His posi- well typified by his position in Glasgow.

The extent of his knowledge and the variety of his resources were fully tested, and the result, as stated by the generous pen of Bobison, was a conviction of the superiority of Watt in these respects to any of his contemporaries","Edinburgh, Glasgow, Greenock, Glasgow",GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

He then commenced experi¬ ments on the amount of steam thus consumed, and on the means of diminishing it. Though the primary ob¬ ject was the repair of a model, it is not to be doubted that Mr M att had in view the practical improvement of the engine on the great scale, with the use of which in the coal-fields of the west of Scotland he was pro¬ bably familiar, having the intention of becoming himself a civil engineer, and being already acquainted with the writings of Desaguiliers and Belidor.6 mentality of his mother’s kinsman Mr George Muirhead, who had then (1754) just exchanged the professorship of oriental lan¬ guages for that of Latin.” It will be seen that this refers to a period antecedent to his journey to London","Glasgow, London",GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"(327.) Much light has been thrown upon the character of Personal 'Watt by the recent publication of his correspondence of Watt6,r by Mr Muirhead.1 We there see the pressure of phy- continued. sical infirmity, and mental despondency and indif¬ ference, under which he laboured from boyhood. We learn the accumulated difficulties, arising from the backward state of the mechanical arts in his time, which delayed for years the successful prosecution of his happiest, and what would appear in our day most easily realized, conceptions. We see him at times ready to abandon fame and profit for the en¬ joyment of the humblest competence with tranquil¬ lity. We find him, mechanic though he was, shrink¬ ing from possible collision with the opinions or in¬ terests of others, and in his early as in his latest days, solicitous to avoid responsibility. He had, in a word, throughout, the finely strung susceptibility of a man of genius, singularly at variance with the necessity he was under of pushing his way in the world, and of turning his inventions to the best com¬ mercial account. Providentially he was thrown in the way of friends to whom, by his private character, he was greatly endeai’ed, and who supplied the ele¬ ments necessary to the successful prosecution of his schemes. The sanguine zeal of Roebuck, the com¬ mercial sagacity of the capitalist Boulton, and not least, the sympathizing friendship of Dr Small, who was well fitted by his character and attainments to mediate between Watt and the other two, were all essential to the realization of the improved steam- engine",Much,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"The name of Robison may perhaps not appear to be sufficiently identified with any great discovery to merit a place in this condensed sketch of the pro¬ gress of science biographically illustrated. Were there no other claim, I should consider it a sufficient one to entitle him to at least a brief notice, that he was by far the -most important, and, as M. Arago has justly called him, “ most illustrious contributor” to the earlier editions of the Encyclopcedia Britan- nica. But he was also a philosopher in a high sense of the word. His knowledge was multifarious in no ordinary degree. He had little of pretension to originality, yet he brought to bear upon matters of science an unfailing amount of excellent common sense, and his personal acquaintance with the Arts which may be called Philosophical far exceeded, I imagine, that of any man of his time. Though not without his prepossessions, he was generous in the highest degree in his estimation of others, who in some sense might have been considered his rivals ; he wras eminently patient in his study of the wmrks of his contemporaries, and in his published writings he laboured to render the results generally accessi¬ ble to ordinary readers, by means of laborious ab¬ stracts, intermingled often with highly original views; and he explained them wdth conscientious energy in his lectures to the students of Natural Philo¬ sophy, whom for thirty years of his life it was his pride and pleasure to instruct. Amidst these con¬ genial labours he found little time for making pro¬ longed original trains of experiment, though the spe¬ cimens which he has almost incidentally left us give the fullest proof of his ability in this respect; and the explanation is, I have no doubt, to be found in the peculiar circumstances of his early life. Until his settlement in Edinburgh, he passed his time in a series of active pursuits, having much more of the character of stirring practical life than of literary re- 1 The Origin and Progress of the Mechanical Inventions of James Watt. 3 vols. 1855",Edinburgh,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

His early tastes were directed with Watt, towards Natural Philosophy. He studied Mathema¬ tics (as in after life) chiefly with reference to its appli- ) cations. Whilst at Glasgow he formed the intimate acquaintance of James Watt, then a practical instru¬ ment maker. In a passage of a private paper, pub¬ lished first in Arago’s Eloge of Watt,1 Robison, with his characteristic generosity, describes his mortifica¬ tion when “ yet a young student” at finding him much his superior in mathematical and mechanical knowledge ; but M.

"The writings of Young and Robison did not im¬ mediately attract the attention of practical men, and Coulomb, who was by far the ablest French experimenter on subjects of mixed mechanics, seems to have done less on the theory of strains producing flexure than in the case of torsion, which he studied with so much success, and applied to such excellent purpose. Nevertheless in his memoir on the Resistance of Masonry, in the 7th vol. of the “ Memoires Presentes” (1776), he had already laid down very clearly the effect of compression on abeam.1 2 It is, however, to Young that we owe the application of these principles in unfolding their legitimate conse¬ quences. In a series of remarkable propositions con¬ tained in the writings I have quoted (344), he assigns numerical relations between the flexure of a beam under almost every supposable circumstance, and the resistance of the material to direct strains. These results have been extensively used by all subsequent writers. They are not equally verified in all classes of substances. This, however, is not wonderful; flexure is not due to direct compressive and extending strains alone ; deformation may take place in a solid without appreciable change of density, thus giving rise to some of the nicest questions in molecular physics","Young, Young","UY,FR",8,"Uruguay,France","South America,Europe"
"Thomas Telford, though neither the contriver of (351.) suspension bridges, nor the introducer of them into Telford; Britain,3 deserves notice from the superior boldness ^idges10n and solidity of the noblest work of the kind which has yet been executed—the Menai Bridge. Telford (and the same may be said of his contemporary Rennie) was more distinguished as a man of judg¬ ment, integrity, and experience, than as eminently original or philosophical. In this respect both yield to Smeaton, who, with Watt, was the founder (each in his own department) of modern engineering. But the beautiful and truly workmanlike structure of the Menai Bridge inaugurated the era of the extensive introduction of that admirable material, wrought iron, into great permanent structures exposed to heavy strains. Cast iron had been used much ear¬ lier, as in the bridge erected at Colebrookdale in 1777 by Mr Derby, and in the very beautiful arch at Sunderland, which dates from 1796. The span of the Menai Bridge is 580 feet, the whole quantity of iron used was 2186 tons, the transverse section of the suspending chains or bars was 260 square inches, supporting a strain of 1094^ tons.

"(352) Telford never made extensive experiments on the Ziata of re-resistance of solids. Some special ones were indeed sistance. made under his direction on wrought iron in par¬ ticular, but in general he seems to have relied upon the old ones of Musschenbroek and Buffon. The barlow,andtw0 persons who first in recent times vigorously Hodgkin- applied themselves to the practical determination 8on- of the data of resistance so long deficient, were Tred- gold, a private engineer, and Professor Barlow of Woolwich. The data they obtained have since been generally used, not only in this, hut in other coun¬ tries. Tredgold’s works (on Carpentry, Strength of Timber, &c.) show a very great aptitude in applying the results of science to practice, and an acquaintance with both which is rarely attained. Mr Eaton Hodg- kinson has made many valuable additions to Tred¬ gold’s work, and has contributed an excellent paper on the strength of pillars to the Philosophical Trans¬ actions (1840.) ^353^ To Mr Hodgkinson we are also indebted for a Geometry useful investigation (in the Manchester Transac- of the tions) into the figure assumed by the chains of sus- catenary. pension bridges. The elegant properties of the simple or geometrical catenary were fully investi¬ gated a century and a half since by the Bernouillis and by David Gregory, hut the application of sus¬ pended structures of immense weight to purposes of utility suggested new problems. Amongst these, perhaps the most interesting was the catenary of uniform strength, in which the section of the sus¬ pending chains is made everywhere proportional to the strain which they have to resist at that particu¬ lar point. Its equation was investigated by Mr Da¬ vies Gilbert in 1826. An elegant and valuable con¬ tribution to the geometry of catenarian curves was made by the late Professor Wallace of Edinburgh,1 with particular application to curves of equilibration for bridges of masonry after the ingenious manner of Bobison mentioned in Art.

Navier, a very eminent French engineer and writer on practical and theoretical mechanics. His work on suspension bridges (1823) is one of the earliest and best. He is also well known for his physico-mathematical re¬ searches on the yielding of elastic solids to pressure under given circumstances, in the course of which he came into collision with Poisson, who gave a some¬ what different theory. The subject is one of ex¬ treme difficulty, owing to our ignorance of the molecular constitution of bodies; and it is believed that all these investigations were so far erroneous that they were based upon the assumption of a single constant to represent the resistance of bodies to change of form and dimension. These (form and dimension) are two very different things, and require distinct treatment.2 British mathematicians have lately paid much attention to these enquiries, with the prospect of a solid improvement in engineering theories.3 The art of bridging over great spaces has been (355.) pushed, by the requirements of the railway system, to Mr Robert an astonishing extent, and under circumstances of^pllen' peculiar difficulty. I shall connect these improve¬ ments with the name of Mr Robert Stephenson, the inventor of the Tubular Bridge, a work which, in its very simplicity, is a triumph of art, and being nothing more than a hollow beam of somewhat pecu¬ liar construction, supported at the ends, it is an ad¬ mirable instance of a structure of which the stability may he easily reduced to calculation",,"FR,GB",8,"France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe"

Yet he had the good fortune, which so many inventors have missed, of meeting with partners able and willing to assist him in carrying out his designs. Amongst these was Andrew Vivian, with whom in 1802 he took out the patent already mentioned for the construction of high- pressure engines, and their application to the move¬ ment of carriages along rails or common roads.

"George Stephenson, civil engineer, was born in 1780 near Newcastle, of respectable persons in the humblest rank of life. His father was either a com¬ mon pitman or otherwise employed about the collier¬ ies of the district, and young Stephenson, without any advantages of education, began to labour for his bread at an early age. His work appears to have been always connected with the machinery of the pits above ground, and not with their excavation. Thus he rose gradually to be an engine-man at the wages of twelve shillings a week. This was at Killingworth near Newcastle, where he showed considerable me¬ chanical ingenuity, and gradually gained the confi¬ dence of his employers. Having married in 1802, he had a son born the following year, the present Mr Robert Stephenson, M.P., whom he brought up with the tenderest care, and whom he ever and justly regarded with a father’s pride. In order to bestow upon him the advantage of that education of which he had himself felt the want, it is stated that he made money at extra hours by mending his neighbours’ clocks and watches, and finally, in more prosperous days, sent his son to complete his education at the University of Edinburgh. George Stephenson never acquired much book-learning himself, but by natural sagacity and observation he attained to a sound knowledge of mechanical principles. We do not claim for him, however, the character of great inven¬ tiveness. His skill rather lay in perceiving how far methods and contrivances already known might be pushed to an advantageous result. He possessed that shrewd decision which ingenious persons often want, enabling him to detect what is truly valuable in the numerous mechanical schemes which at any time are afloat, and to devise the means of realizing them. He also possessed that confidence in his own judgment which is necessary to carry out principles to their legitimate extent, but from which feebler or less practical minds usually shrink","Newcastle, Newcastle, University, Edinburgh","ZA,US,GB",8,"South Africa,United States,United Kingdom","Africa,North America,Europe"
"Like Watt and all other innovators, his great diffi¬ culty was to get the machinery of his locomotives pro¬ perly made, and the great railway movement of 1825 was anticipated by the establishment in 1820 of an engine factory at Newcastle, which, till after the (399.) opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1831, remained the only one, and for long afterwards the best of its class. The cranked axle contrived by Trevithick, and abandoned because it could not be properly welded, was now restored; the heavy loco¬ motive was placed on strong but easy steel springs, wrought iron was skilfully introduced into the wheels of the carriages, and the whole machinery was made to work with precision, and to combine a degree of resistance never before anticipated with comparative lightness. The factory was established in 1821, and the first passenger locomotive was started on the Dar¬ lington and Stockton Railway in 1825","Newcastle, Liverpool","ZA,GB",8,"South Africa,United Kingdom","Africa,Europe"
"projected capital of these companies amounted to not less than L.30,000,000 or L.40,000,000.

For the next few years his time was divided much between Cambridge and London. He was now twenty-three years of age, and his mental habits too much formed to bend to the rules of Cam¬ bridge study.

"We hear little of his occupations at Cambridge, but we can hardly doubt that his private studies then ranged over the vast fields of erudition which he af¬ terwards proved that he had made so completely his own ; and we cannot doubt that he was then preparing the groundwork of his theory of optics, although his discovery of interference was certainly not made at Cambridge, and probably in London after his settle¬ ment there in 1800.1 His first paper on sound and light is dated from Cambridge in July 1799","Cambridge, Cambridge, London, Cambridge","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"I have entered into these details because they throw light on the peculiarities of Young’s cha¬ racter and attainments. He was to a great degree self-educated ; and his studies in consequence may be called desultory, though none would dare to call them superficial. Mathematicians may consider his acquaintance with their science as not technically complete, yet one of them admits that “ he could make a small amount of mathematics go farther than any one else.” Had he been a consummate analyst it is unlikely that we should have had in him the author of the undulatory theory, the difficulties of which in its earlier stages made it unpalatable to Laplace, Poisson, and the most considerable French mathematicians. Having thought out for himself every one of the multifarious subjects with which he grappled, his writings have a striking force and ori¬ ginality, and his reports of the labours of others are almost invariably drawn from a study of their original works. His earliest principle was, that what one man has done another may accomplish; and one of the many respects in which he resembled his great predecessor Newton, was unbounded confidence in the powers of “ patient thought.” Not that he con¬ fined the desire to excel to purely intellectual matters","Young, Laplace, Newton","US,UY,FR",8,"United States,Uruguay,France","North America,South America,Europe"

Not that he was averse (as is often supposed) to the presence of Ether as modify¬ ing the corpuscular theory of light; on the con¬ trary, in many of his minor writings he speaks of its existence as all but certain, and as a requisite adjunct to the corpuscular hypothesis to which he had been led by the facts of reflection and refrac¬ tion.1 But he never adjusted the terms of a compro¬ mise, and must be held, we think, to have left behind him no substantive theory of light worthy of the name. The question never perhaps very seriously engaged his attention after the publication of Huy¬ gens’ book ;2 and we know that about that time his intellectual energies received a shock which left him indisposed for the fatigue of constructing new theories, and still more disinclined to publish them","Newton, Newton, Huy","US,BE",8,"United States,Belgium","North America,Europe"
"(464.) It might be supposed that Young’s discovery and Opposition its application excited the notice and applause of all to Young s persons interested in optics. This was very far from V16WS* x •/ being the case. Though he brought it several times in succession and in different forms before the Royal Society of London, there is no evidence, so far as I at present know, of his having then obtained a single ad¬ herent. Davy was no optician; Wollaston was too cautious to commit himself, though probably giving a tacit assent; Cavendish was aged, and besides had attended less to this subject than to most others ; Sir William Herschel had only lately taken up phy¬ sical optics, and that with reference to the qualities of the spectrum least connected with Young’s obser¬ vations. At the Royal Institution Young vainly at¬ tempted, in the elaborate course of lectures which he there delivered for two years (1801-3) on natural philosophy and the arts, to arouse a popular inte¬ rest in the unveiling of these mysteries. The ab¬ struseness of his discourses scared that mixed audi¬ ence, and his colleague Davy, in a letter, incidentally observes that Young would be satisfied if any one would even offer criticisms on his opinions. Criticism of a certain kind, however, he soon got in abundance","Young, Young, London, Young, Young, Young","UY,GB",8,"Uruguay,United Kingdom","South America,Europe"
"The Edinburgh Review, in its second number, under¬ took to crush at once the theory of Young and his reputation as a philosopher, and this (in singular contrast to its avowed principles), not by argument, but by an appeal to the weight of prescriptive autho¬ rity in favour of the Newtonian hypothesis, conclud¬ ing with an admonition to the Royal Society to cling to its old standards and old celebrities, and to save its Transactions from degenerating into volumes of miscellanies. This attack, paltry as it was, seriously prejudiced the reception, or even the dispassionate consideration of Young’s views.

"When one of these paths differs from the other by the length of half a wave of the particular kind of light considered, darkness will result, but a feebler maxi¬ mum will be again attained when the interval rises to a whole wave-length, or to two or more. Hence these consequences follow—first, that the bright part of each colour is limited by its self-destruction to a narrow band, and thus the purity of prismatic colour so striking in a well-formed rainbow is preserved ; secondly, that each colour may attain (by interference) a second and a third maximum, corresponding in fact to the position of the spurious bows; thirdly, that these phenomena of perfect definition of the primary and secondary bows, and of repeated maxima in the supernumerary bows, depend essentially on this condi¬ tion, that the drops of falling rain shall approach to 1 This experiment is usually (and justly) ascribed to an eminent and amiable British philosopher. But it had already been performed by Fresnel with a special object. See Ann. de Chimie et de Physique, second series, xv. 382",,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"But it is unaccountable that Young should have been satisfied with the belief that the screens employed 1 Camb. Trans., vol. vi. (1838.) 2 Ibid., should in every case have reflected an appreciable quantity of light (or indeed any light at all) in the required direction. It might be conceivable in the case of a cylindrical wire or a cylindrical hair; but how could a film of gold-leaf or a slip of paper re¬ ceiving the light on its broad side furnish such a de¬ gree of oblique illumination ? It is wonderful that Young’s intuitive sense did not perceive that the por¬ tion of a luminiferous wave passing near an opaque edge, is deficient on one side of the interfering wave¬ lets which are necessary to make the boundary of the shadow definite, and to extinguish the laterally- spreading light. In short, he did not allow to Huy¬ gens’ principle (see art. 455) the full breadth of its application—a discovery made some years later by Fresnel, who has the credit of first explaining these exterior fringes","Young, Young, Huy","UY,BE",8,"Uruguay,Belgium","South America,Europe"
"The result of all this was the suppression of many of his opinions, and the publication of others in so con¬ cealed and uninviting a form that they remained for years nearly buried and unknown to men of science. He contributed a series of articles on sub- Hls articles jects connected with light to the Quarterly Review ; in the and we may well smile at the abstruse and really ob- Iteview^ scure dissertations on detached points of science— often unmercifully loaded with algebra—thus inter¬ spersed with articles of popular criticism for the enter¬ tainment of the reading public. From some of these papers we may readily gather the soreness which he felt at the cold reception of his discoveries. Farther and still more important original speculations were contained in a series of anonymous papers (sixty- three in number) on a vast variety of subjects, both in science and philology, contributed to the Encyclopce- and Ency- dia Britannica. It is not in a work such as this that CJiritannica we usua^y look for the first publication of great and original views : the articles being anonymous could only very gradually attract notice by their intrinsic merit; and the obscurity of some of those written by Young rendered this difficult enough. But it is most fortunate that he was induced thus to write : many of his most original thoughts must have been lost but for these concealed repositories. In the articles in the Quarterly Review, for example, we watch with interest the impression which contemporary discoveries made upon his mind. The spheroidal wave of extraordinary refraction is explained by unequal elasticity of the crystal in different directions j1 the discovery of polar¬ ization by reflection is received with characteristic can¬ dour, as giving a temporary blow to the undulatory theory ;2 whilst in a later paper the cause of chromatic polarization is convincingly deduced from the prin¬ ciple of interferences, and in the space of two lines the peculiar coloured laminae occurring in Iceland spar, which had been noticed by several experi¬ menters, are accounted for.3 From about 1815 the optical discoveries of Young (470.) were so intimately connected with those of his younger Tlieoi7 °t friend and rival Fresnel, that it seems best to defer de- our account of them until we consider (in § 3 of this ferred to chapter) the peculiar researches of Fresnel, which § 3> ultimately rendered the phenomena of polarization the most impregnable position of the partizans of the undulatory theory. The first great step was the con¬ ception of transversevibrations of ether, as constituting polarization. This, as we shall see, was first pub¬ lished by Young. It is to be regretted that the tardy and imperfect publication of Fresnel’s memoirs on the one hand, and the resolution of Young to adhere to an anonymous and indirect mode of announcing his discoveries, on the other, render the history of the subject sometimes obscure.

"It was known to Bartholin of Copenhagen, about 1669, that Iceland or calcareous-spar has the pro¬ perty of dividing a ray of light, which falls upon it in almost any direction, into two; one of which is refracted according to the usual law, but the other in an extraordinary manner, which was first analyzed by Huygens—a problem of great difficulty, in which Newton not only failed, but he also erred in con¬ tinuing to pronounce Huygens’ solution false. The solution was this, that there is one direction in the crystal parallel to which both the rays (called the ordinary and the extraordinary') move in a similar and uniform manner. In other directions their pro¬ pagation may be expressed by considering the ordi¬ nary ray within the crystal to be due to a spherical wave (the centre of which coincides with the point of incidence), whilst the extraordinary ray corre¬ sponds to a flattened spheroidal wave concentric with the former, and having its axis coincident with a diameter of the sphere, and parallel to the minera- logical axis of the crystal. Both rays, on the Huy- genian hypothesis, move slower than in air, but the extraordinary ray everywhere faster than the ordi¬ nary ray, excepting only in the axial direction. A perfectly plain though necessarily complex construc¬ tion was given by Huygens for the purpose of tracing both rays in the course of their refraction, founded on this idea","Copenhagen, Newton","IS,DK,US",8,"Iceland,Denmark,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"It was several years later that Malus directed his (477.) attention to the subject, unaware of what had been accomplished by Wollaston. He had returned in 1801 from the unfortunate French expedition to Egypt, where he was engaged as an officer of en¬ gineers, and had ruined his health through fatigue and the insalubrity of the climate. He was an ac¬ complished mathematician, having acted as professor both at the Polytechnic School and that of Metz, and was of course a member of the Institute of Cairo","Metz, Cairo","EG,FR",8,"Egypt,France","Africa,Europe"
"On his return to France, during the intervals of his military duties, he occupied himself in the composi¬ tion of an elaborate analytical treatise on optics, which had already occupied his attention in Egypt. This led him to the subject of double refraction, and he verified by numerous experiments the accuracy of Huygens’ law. La Place wrote a paper on the mathe¬ matical law of the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in which he introduced the idea of a repulsive force emanating from the axis of the crystal; but it may be truly affirmed that the notion of a spheroidal un¬ dulation so happily introduced by Huygens is the only one which really fits the case; and by the very impossibility of expressing the facts intelligibly with¬ out it, gives an undisputed advantage to that theory",,"FR,EG",8,"France,Egypt","Europe,Africa"
"(479.) Malus had already, in the end of 1808, announced Huygens’ a property of light which, if not absolutely new, was so with reference to the circumstances in tionby'calcwhich it was produced. The polarization of light spar. was in reality discovered by Huygens previous to 1680. He had observed that the two rays into which common light is divided in passing through Iceland spar have a singular diversity of character, which Newton afterwards described as an opposite polarity",Newton,"IS,US",8,"Iceland,United States","Europe,North America"
"Huygens showed that if two rhombs of doubly re¬ fracting spar are laid symmetrically one upon the other, the “ extraordinary” ray yielded by the first is extraordinarily refracted by the second, and the “ordi¬ nary” ray from the first is ordinarily refracted by the second. But when we revolve the upper rhomb as it lies upon the lower one through a right angle, a remarkable change appears. The extraordinary ray escaping from the first is now ordinarily re¬ fracted by the second, and vice versa, so that the qualities of the two rays differ but only so far as this, that either may be assimilated to the other by making it (or the crystal from which it derives its properties) revolve round ninety degrees. A definite notion of such a distinction may be formed by imagining a musical string vibrating at one time in a vertical, at another in a horizontal, plane. If we could possibly imagine light to consist of vibrations of this descrip¬ tion, the two rays of Iceland spar might be conceived the one to vibrate in a plane passing through the axis of the crystal, the other in a plane perpendicular to that. Such light might truly be said to have ac¬ quired the property of having sides. In the language of Newton, it is 'polarized",Newton,"IS,US",8,"Iceland,United States","Europe,North America"
"(480.) The discovery of Malus consisted in showing that Malus dis- light may acquire properties identical with those of larization c^er raJ yielded by refraction through Iceland spar, by reflec- by the very simple process of simple reflection at a par- tion- ticular angle from any transparent body. Thus for a surface of water he found this angle to be 52° 45' with the perpendicular, and for glass 54° 35'. The reflected light in either case has exactly the property of the or¬ dinary ray transmitted by a crystal whose principal sec¬ tion (that is, a section passing through the axis of the crystal) is parallel to the plane of reflection. Con¬ sequently this light will be acted on by a doubly re¬ fracting crystal placed in its way precisely as if it had emerged from a similar crystal; and, on the other hand, if the two rays emerging from a crystal be incident on water or glass as above mentioned, the one will be copiously reflected from the surface, whilst the other will not be reflected at all, but pass entirely into the transparent substance. Farther, as might be expected, light thus polarized by reflection, when it falls on a second similar reflecting surface at the same angle as before, will be copiously reflected if the planes of reflection coincide, but will refuse to be reflected in an appreciable degree when the planes of reflection are perpendicular",,IS,8,Iceland,Europe
"This phenomenon was detected by Malus by casually (481.) observing that a ray from the setting sun reflected Occasion from a distant window, and viewed through a pieceof lt‘ of Iceland spar, afforded but a single image in two positions of the latter. The experiment attracted uni¬ versal attention, and became the germ of a series of optical discoveries almost unprecedented for their beauty and variety; yet most of the experiments may be made quite as well when light is polarized by the method of Huygens as by that of Malus. Neverthe¬ less the former had remained a sterile fact for 130 years. Upon such trifling circumstances does the progress of knowledge often depend",,IS,8,Iceland,Europe
"(485.) Augustin Fresnel was born at Broglie, in France, resne . iQth May 1788, of a feeble constitution, and he con¬ tinued throughout his too short life a prey to attacks of bad health. As a boy, his slow apprehension and uncertain memory gave no indication of the maturity of his judgment. He entered first the Polytechnic School, then that of Fonts et Chaussees. His fidelity to the Bourbon cause occasioned his being harshly treated by Napoleon, and he retired to Normandy in the beginning of 1815, to pursue the scientific studies which he had always loved",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Diffraction Diffraction.—The theory of light in particular at- of light, tracted his attention, and he had a steady belief that the Newtonian doctrine was erroneous, though in ignorance, as it appears, of the undulatory doctrines of Hooke, Huygens, and Young. The phenomena of diffraction, or the coloured fringes which are seen in the interior of the shadows of opake bodies when illuminated by a minute source of light, attracted his attention as most proper for deciding the deli¬ cate question of the molecular or undulatory cha- Presnel’s racter of light. The results of his experiments were moii,me"" detailed in a memoir confided in the first place to his friend Arago, and by him communicated to the Institute of France (October 1815). This remark¬ able paper contained much which Dr Young had al¬ ready discovered, and the explanations of the experi¬ ments which it described, both new and old, by the theory of undulations, were common to both. Dr Young having anticipated the publication by at least a dozen years, there could be no question of pri¬ ority ; but it is equally certain that Fresnel was un¬ aware of what Young had done until it was pointed out to him by Arago. His memoir, which was pub¬ lished in great part in the Annales de Chimie for 1816, contains much which is interesting. The mode of observing the diffraction bands directly by means of a lens, without the intervention of a screen, was equally new and important. The observation that the interior fringes of the shadow of a narrow body, such as a wire, disappear when the light is intercepted on either side of the wire, leading to the conclusion that the union of the light from both sides is neces¬ sary for their occurrence, was (as we have seen) one of Young’s capital experiments. The explana¬ tion of Newton’s rings, by the interference of the light reflected from two adjacent surfaces, though partly anticipated by Hooke, was equally important. Nu¬ merous measures of the distances of the exterior diffraction bands from the geometrical shadow, as formed by homogeneous red light, are then given and compared with theory. Here Fresnel was on original ground. These accurate numerical comparisons, af¬ terwards pursued to a greater extent, constituted one of the most important bases of the new theory. In obtaining them he was materially aided by Arago, who, though considerably his senior, generously as¬ sisted him in every respect, and gave him the full ad¬ vantage of his station as a member of the Institute, and of his experience","Young, Young, Young, Young, Newton","UY,FR,US",8,"Uruguay,France,United States","South America,Europe,North America"
"The difficulty was, to account for two waves travel- ■FRESNEL. 905 ling at the same time through the same portion of matter with unequal velocities. The moment that the idea of molecular movement transverse to the line of propagation was admitted, it was easy to see that no contradiction was involved in the idea. Two waves might simultaneously travel in the same direc¬ tion, and through the same medium, provided the molecular displacements were in different planes. So happy a solution could hardly fail to strike such minds as those of Young and Fresnel with the impress of conviction. A closer analysis confirmed the proba¬ bility. Iceland spar (or rather the ether imprisoned within it) is conceived of as a medium of uniform elas¬ ticity in all planes perpendicular to the axis, but of a different and greater elasticity in any direction parallel to the axis. It is shown to result from this, that in the direction of the axis alone is the motion of light independent of the plane of the vibrations of which it is composed, and consequently no separation of rays occurs. When a ray moves parallel to what may by an analogy be called the equatoreal plane of the crystal, its undulation will, generally speaking, be resolved into two whose vibrations are parallel and perpendicular to that plane, and which travel with different velocities though in the same direction. If the ray take any other direction through the crystal, both the direction and velocity of the divided rays differ. The form of the extraordinary wave is exactly the spheroid of Huygens",Young,"IS,UY",8,"Iceland,Uruguay","Europe,South America"

Fresnel at^^!^ once assumed that the elasticities must in that case axes, vary in three rectangular directions, and he proceeded to calculate the manner of propagation of a wave through a medium thus constituted. I had proposed to attempt some explanation of the steps of his most ingenious and profound argument, but I find it incom¬ patible with the space at my disposal, and at any rate hardly to be apprehended without the use of symbols or figures. For these reasons I shall merely state the results. When the medium presents un¬ equal elasticities in three rectangular directions, the surface of the wave consists of two sheets each tra¬ velling with its peculiar velocity. But neither of these being spherical, the result cannot be expressed by the ordinary law of refraction. In tivo directions within the crystal, the wave surfaces coincide, or the two rays coalesce. These directions are evidently the optic axes, and the w^ave surface in their neigh¬ bourhood has very interesting geometrical and physical properties which have been elucidated by British philosophers, as will be noticed in another section. The true optical axes cannot exceed two, and when two of the three elasticities become equal, they merge into one. This is the 1 Young’s reasoning (Quarterb/ Review 1809, and Works, vol. i. p. 228) is based on an experiment by Chladni on the differing velocity with which sound is propagated in wood, depending on the direction of the fibres",Young,"UY,GB",8,"Uruguay,United Kingdom","South America,Europe"

"Chap. V., § 4.] OPTICS- by Sir D. Brewster. These proposals were all alike unknown to Fresnel, who had the grand merit, in a case of this kind, first, of carrying his happy idea into effectual execution, and secondly, of giving it a wonderful extension by the invention of a multitude of other forms of refracting and totally reflecting apparatus, till then unimagined as well as unexe¬ cuted.1 In 1823 the lighthouse of Corduan, at the mouth of the Garonne, was furnished with the new lenticular system, which was very skilfully executed by Soleil of Paris. The illumination was provided by means of a beautiful and powerful lamp with se¬ veral concentric wicks, the joint invention of Fresnel and Arago, which gave twenty-five times the light of the best Argand then in use. The system was found to work so well that it was speedily extended in France, then to Holland, and in the third place to Scotland, principally through the energy of the late Bobert Stevenson and the present Mr Alan Steven¬ son, his son, to the latter of whom we owe the best and most compendious treatise on the subject of lighthouses,2 as well as the noblest exemplification of it in the Skerryvore Lighthouse, erected by him in 1843. The same small work contains the details of Fresnel’s admirably ingenious applications of the principle of refraction to the distribution of light under almost every circumstance, which were not, however, published by their inventor","Paris, Holland","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"It is hoped that his surviving brother, M. Leonor Fres¬ nel, who is well qualified for the task, will collect his scattered papers and edit them, with a suitable bio¬ graphy. The eloge of Fresnel, written by the man most competent to render him justice—Arago—remained more than twenty years among the unedited papers of that philosopher, and has only appeared since his death in 1853. The cause of this suppression was one of those partly political and partly personal dis¬ putes which seem almost inseparable from the pro¬ ceedings of the Institute. The eloge was announced to be read just two days before the Revolution of 1830 burst forth ; Arago could not persuade him¬ self at such a moment to discuss the merits of the Theory of Double Refraction without committing himself also on the politics of the day. Disputes arose, friendships cooled, and the unlucky work was re¬ turned to the author’s desk. Hence no biography of Fresnel appears in the publications of the Institute, but his reputation will be treasured in France and elsewhere, when the more conspicuous laurels of many of his compeers are withered and half-forgotten",,FR,8,France,Europe

"(520.) Sir David Brewster was born at Jedburgh, in His early Scotland, on the 11th December 1784. He was studies. educated for the Scottish Church, and having en¬ tered the University of Edinburgh at a very early age, pursued his studies under Robison, Playfair, and Stewart, and formed the friendship of those eminent men. Amongst fellow-students of no common distinction who at that time frequented the college lectures, and of whom not a few were destined to signalize themselves in literature, science, and the career of politics, he formed the particular acquaint¬ ance of Mr, now Lord Brougham, and through him was led to study the inflection of light, and to repeat Newton’s experiments. This was in 1799 ; nor did he afterwards lose sight of a science which he was so signally to improve. The distraction of other occupations, the calls of his profession, and his indifferent health prevented, however, any very constant application to optics: and the part of the subject he then principally studied was rather connected with the use and theory of instruments than with physical optics in the sense in which we have explained it. This is evident from his first separate publication in 1813, “ on new Philosophical Instru¬ ments,” which, though containing many ingenious and valuable suggestions, fell short of the importance of his subsequent publications","University, Edinburgh, Newton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"Sir David Brpwster’s genius was first called forth (521.) by the announcement of Malus’s great discovery Directs his in 1808 of the polarization of light by reflection, t0 But for the unfortunate political relations of France optics, and England at the time, which prevented, to a degree which now appears almost incredible, the transmission of even the most interesting scientific facts from one country to the other, our country¬ men would have borne a larger share in the dis¬ coveries which immediately followed; and it would have been an easier task to apportion with his¬ torical accuracy what was due to each. As the French philosophers remained long in ignorance of the discoveries of Davy, and were anticipated in every important step in voltaic science, so Malus and Arago pursued and published researches and bril- 1 See Electricity, § 4. 2 Electricity, § 5",,FR,8,France,Europe

Brewster learned first in February 1814 that Malus had m March 1811 published the discovery of the polar¬ ization of light by refraction, which he also had made ; whilst Arago’s experiments on coloured polarization were likewise unknown to him through the same want of international communication",March,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"From this time (1813) Sir David Brewster became a regular contributor to the London Philosophical Transactions, which, as well as those of Edinburgh, contain a series of elaborate experimental investi¬ gations due to him, which have hardly been sur¬ passed. It is difficult to overrate the importance of these researches, whether for the intrinsic interest of the phenomena they reveal, or for the significance of the empirical laws by which their author, with a rare sagacity, succeeded in classifying facts, and afforded a sure basis for farther generalization. The number and variety of these researches is so ex¬ ceedingly great, and in many cases so impossible to explain without entering into minute detail, that I shall, in accordance with the plan of this essay, merely indicate some of the most generally impor¬ tant by arranging them in groups. Such are— I. The laws of polarization by reflection and re¬ fraction, and other quantitative laws of phenomena",Edinburgh,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"(529.) III. Possibly the most remarkable of Sir David Discovery Brewster’s discoveries,—at all events, that which crystals! probably cost him most labour to develope,—was that there are crystals possessing two axes of double re¬ fraction, and showing many remarkable phenomena, which indicate a connection between optical structure and crystalline form. No one before him suspected the existence of a doubly-refracting structure differ¬ ing from that so ably investigated by Huygens and Malus in Iceland spar. In 1813 Sir David Brew¬ ster had discovered coloured rings in topaz when viewed by polarized light. Though intimately con¬ nected with M. Arago’s observation of colours in crystallized plates, these interesting phenomena had a still more extraordinary and geometrical character",,IS,8,Iceland,Europe
"Dr Wollaston afterwards (1814) discovered a phe- (530.) nomenon equally beautiful in calcareous spar, ofPhenornena which Sir D. Brewster had already perceived traces tfon^shown in some other crystals. Concentric with the posi- by uniaxal tion of the axis of double refraction (or optic axis), crystals, in a crystal of that mineral cut with two parallel faces perpendicular thereto, a series of perfectly sym¬ metric and exquisitely coloured rings are seen in po¬ larized light, having a white or black cross travers¬ ing them, according to the position of the analyzing plate. This magnificent phenomenon, which (except¬ ing, of course, the rings of biaxal crystals mentioned above) has perhaps no parallel in optical science, is seen in the most perfect manner possible in an appa¬ ratus constructed solely of Iceland spar, cemented by Canada balsam. A Nicol’s single-image prism1 is used to polarize, another to analyze the light, and between them is a plate of calcareous spar properly cut. It is a truly astonishing paradox to see the union of three perfectly transparent and colourless crystals display by their union such an exquisite combination of form and colour. The pole or centre of the rings in calc-spar coinciding with the axis of double refraction, of necessity suggested the idea that topaz, which shows two systems of rings arranged round two poles, must possess two axes of double refraction ; in other words, that there must exist within the crystal two directions (not mere lines), parallel to which a transmitted ray emerges without subdivision into two pencils",,"IS,CA",8,"Iceland,Canada","Europe,North America"
"This probable conjecture was verified by careful (531.) obseiwation, not only in topaz, but also in a vast Double sys- variety of other crystals which were found by Sir t®ar“s David Brewster much more commonly to possess two^’ m re’ than one system of rings. Amongst the earliest ex¬ amples which he observed were nitre, mica, acetate of lead, and Rochelle salt.

"(532.) A series of researches of the most elaborate Kelation of description led Sir David Brewster to this addi- optical cha- ^ona) an(f admirable discovery, viz., that the optical crystalline characters of single refraction, double refraction forms. with one axis, and double refraction with two axes, have reference invariably to the primitive crystalline form of the mineral, and that the complexity of the optical character is as invariably related in degree to the complexity of the crystalline figure. Cubical and regularly octahedral crystals (as rock salt and fluor spar) being possessed of perfect symmetry in three prin¬ cipal directions, possess also simple refraction. Crys¬ tals with one predominant line or axis of symmetry —as rhombohedrons, octahedrons with square bases, right prisms with square or hexagonal bases—have a single axis of double refraction. Such, for instance, are Iceland spar, zircon, ice, beryl. Finally, all crystals unsymmetrical in the three principal directions, in¬ cluding prisms and octahedrons whose bases are not square, and those which are oblique, have two axes of double refraction. The rarity and minute¬ ness of many crystals, the difficulty of cutting them, and when cut, of detecting their optic axes, evi¬ dently made the research one of extreme labour, yet highly remunerative, not only through the discovery of the general principle, but by the vast amount of beautiful and varied optic displays witnessed in the course of it. Sir David Brewster was nearly, if not quite, alone in this research, and after a short resis¬ tance on the part of some mineralogists, his principle of discrimination of primitive forms of crystallization by optical characters has been perfectly established",,IS,8,Iceland,Europe

"(556.) M. Augustin Louis Cauchy has been long known M. Cauchy as one 0f the ablest and most prolific mathematical mathemati- wr'ters of this century. Besides numerous and im- cal labours, portant memoirs, on nearly every branch of pure and applied mathematics, published in the Journal de VEcole Polytechnique, and the Memoirs of the In¬ stitute, he has published, in a separate form, Exer¬ cises des Mathematiques in two series of volumes; and for many years scarcely a weekly meeting of the Academy of Sciences occurred without a mathema¬ tical memoir of this prolific author being laid on the table, and subsequently printed in the Comptes Ren- dus. The integral calculus and other parts of ana¬ lysis form the subjects of a large part of these writings; but the theory of hydrodynamics in the earlier, and of optics in the later part of his career, are largely re¬ presented. So diffuse and desultory a mode of publi¬ cation has been little favourable to those who wish to make themselves acquainted with what has been ac¬ complished by M. Cauchy. The scientific world is in¬ debted to Abbe Moigno2 in France, M. Radicke3in Germany, and Professor Powell4 in England, for ana¬ lyzing in part his optical labours.

"(560.) When, however, undulationists were pressed on on the fi- subject, it was easy to see the direction in which nite dis- at least a plausible explanation might he sought. In tances of the usual form of equation for vibrations in air, ing par-at' ^ven by Lagrange, the integration is effected by as- ticles. suming the intervals between the particles evanescent compared with the length of a wave. This is per¬ fectly true in the case of sound, and all sounds ap¬ pear in consequence to travel uniformly. But should it fail in the case of light, that is, should the inter¬ vals of the ethereal particles bear some sensible ratio to that very small quantity, the length of a wave, what would be the result ? M. Cauchy has made out, by a very complex analysis, that in this case the longer waves will travel most rapidly, and conse¬ quently be least refracted. Several other writers, especially Professor Kelland, obtained similar re¬ sults; and Mr Airy, by very simple, though only approximate, considerations, showed the dependence of refraction on the length of a wave.1 M. Cauchy’s memoir appeared in 1835 at Prague, in a bulky and abstruse form: the mathematical investigations are very long and complex, the numerical verifications scarcely less so.2 The indices of refraction, observed by Fraunhofer, for different lines of the spectrum, in different kinds of glass, together with the correspond¬ ing wave-lengths for these rays, formed the principal data for comparison. But others have since been obtained by Rudberg and Professor Powell, and care¬ fully compared with M. Cauchy’s theory by the lat¬ ter, and the coincidence appears satisfactory.3 But in estimating the value of this coincidence, it is to be observed that of 7 indices of refraction observed for each substance, 3 must be used to ascertain the constants in the formula, and only 4 remain to be calculated",Prague,CZ,8,Czechia,Europe
"J. W.

When Lx becomes very small, the first ratio becomes unity",Jena,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"In 1814 J. Nicephore Niepce, a retired proprie- (569.) tor at Chalons sur Saone,2 entered into a similar en- ^g6^01,6 quiry, but by methods quite different. He employed ^iep the solar effect upon resinous bodies, and some at least of his pictures were executed on plates of pewter or of rolled silver. They were mostly copies of engravings, and the light parts corresponded to the lights of the originals. He, however, at length suc¬ ceeded in fixing impressions of vieAvs in the camera obscura, though in an imperfect manner, and after very long exposure. The pictures thus obtained had this in common with more perfect processes, that the lu¬ minous impression was first brought into view by a chemical process subsequent to exposure in the camera. In 1825 Nicephore Niepce became associated with Daguerre, who had previously been engaged in Daguerre, the same research ; they agreed to communicate the results of their several experiments. The result, as is well known, was the invention of the Daguerreo¬ type, not improperly called after Daguerre, who seems really to have worked it out almost entirely for himself, after the death of Niepce in 1833; whilst so patient and determined was Daguerre in Mrs Mary 1 The maiden name of this accomplished lady was Mary Somerville ; she was born, I believe, at Jedburgh, and married first Mr Somerville Greig, afterwards her relative Dr Somerville. She is known in British science not only as the able commentator of Laplace’s Meca- — magne- nique Celeste, but as the author of some ingenious and apparently convincing experiments on the magnetizing power of the violet tic action ray. Some anomaly, however, remains to be explained on this subject, as the result cannot always be obtained. Several years of light [?]. before Dr Faraday made his discovery of what he terms the “ magnetization of light” (see chapter vii., § 5), the writer of these pages supposed that the reaction of light and magnetism, observed by Morichini and Mrs Somerville, might be due to a la¬ tent and casual polarization of the light which was not present in all the experiments ; and, in particular, he suspected that circu¬ larly polarized light might have a magnetic influence; but his experiments to this effect, in May 1836, were not successful, though he thinks them worth repeating",Laplace,"US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"keeping his secret until brought to perfection, that he did not even show his results until early in 1839, when the numerous specimens he had to exhibit ri¬ valled in delicacy anything that the art has since produced.1 The daguerreotype is depicted in the camera on a plate of silver, coated with an evanescent film of iodide, by exposure for a short time to the vapour of iodine. After the light has acted, and the plate has been withdrawn from the camera, no trace of a pic¬ ture is visible until it has been exposed to the vapour of mercury, which, by its peculiar action on the places where light has acted, produces a correct picture of the object (or 'positive image, as it is called, light an¬ swering to light). It is then fixed, as it is called, by a bath of dissolved hypo-sulphite of soda, which has the property of removing the iodide of silver wherever the light has not acted. This singular and elaborate process has since been but slightly modified by vari¬ ous plans for rendering the iodide more exquisitely sensitive. To M. Niepce belongs the credit (1) of having fixed an impression of light, (2) of using metal plates, (3) of forming a picture by means of a camera obscura ; to Daguerre, on the other hand, the novel and ingenious use of vapours instead of washes, and the whole succession of operations in the daguerreotype. When the French government acquired for the public (the French public, however, only) a right of property in the invention, they marked their sense of the share of merit of the in¬ ventors, by awarding to Daguerre 6U00, to M.

Being destined for the medical profession, he removed in 1750 or 1751 to Edinburgh, where he benefited especially by the lectures of Cullen, a most eminent physician, and the author of a beautiful experiment on the cold produced during evaporation. Before Black gradu¬ ated (in 1754) he had entered upon a course of chemi¬ cal experiments connected with the causticity of many earthy bodies, which ended in his first (and perhaps most famous) discovery of the existence of fixed air or carbonic acid gas as an essential constituent of marble and other solids, together with a train of important consequences.

"Having read the correspondence published by Mr Muirhead, I cannot doubt that Watt, whatever his private opinions might continue to be, would never have urged his views on an unwilling public, but would have finally suppressed the letter to Priestley, had not the experiments and claims of Cavendish at home, and of Lavoisier in France, reanimated all his zeal for the assertion of his opinion. This in¬ deed Watt ingenuously admits in the letter to Sir Joseph Banks just cited, where he states that the fact of similar theories having since been supported by philosophers of first-rate abilities, removed his second objection to publication. As the suppression of his paper would have relieved Watt of all the re¬ sponsibility of error, it seems impossible to allow him the advantage—of which that suppression deprived him—of anticipating the date of his matured convict tion; and to this conviction we have his own evidence that Cavendish’s publication as well as certain addi¬ tional experiments of his own influentially contri¬ buted. Watt, in after life, may be said to have tacitly relinquished to Cavendish the honour which, in the first irritation of the conflict of their claims, he showed nodisposition to do; it is, therefore, reasonable to infer that, on reflection, he saw good reasons for doing so",,FR,8,France,Europe
"Cavendish’s publications extended over the greater part of his active life, but those on chemistry and electricity, on which his fame principally depends, do not extend beyond the year 1775 ; the date of his paper on the density of the earth is 1798. He died 24th February 1810, at the age of 79. He appears to have.exercised scarcely less influence by his general devotion to science, than by his specific discoveries, great and original as they were. In 1782, when Playfair met him incidentally in London, he de¬ scribed him as being generally looked up to as one possessed of talents confessedly superior, and as the only member of the Boyal Society who then united the knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, and ex¬ perimental philosophy. The absolute devotion of his life to inquiries the most abstractly scientific, whilst he showed an entire indifference to the luxuries which his wealth might have commanded, and the social station to which his birth entitled him, could not fail to inspire respect for his character, as well as to obtain the homage of mankind for pursuits so dignified and so generally disregarded. Many curious anecdotes are related of the annoyance which the inevitable accumulation of his unspent income occasioned. He no doubt would have distributed more liberally what he so little valued, but for the amount of time and inquiry which such a course must have compelled him to withdraw from his beloved pursuits",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"He published in 1772 a paper on the Latent Heat (607.) of Water, and some years afterwards one on the Latent Papers on Heat of Steam, which, in general, merely reproduce h.eal~cal°' the views of Black. In the memoirs of the Aca- specific demy of Sciences for 1780 (published 1784), we heat, find an important paper on Heat written in conjunc¬ tion with Laplace, in which the calorimeter is de¬ scribed, though not under that appellation, together with its applications and their results. The prin¬ ciple of the calorimeter is too well known to require to be detailed here; but the authors of the joint memoir refer, with commendable precision, to the pre¬ vious labours of Wilcke of Sweden, who first employed the melting of snow to measure the quantities of heat given off by bodies in cooling. To Laplace and La¬ voisier, is, however, due an important addition which could alone impart any value to the results,—that of the external chamber of ice which prevents fusion taking place by the contact of the external air and by radiation. The French philosophers were not so successful in eliminating the other source of inac¬ curacy specified by Wilcke, which arises from the difficulty of drawing off the whole of the melted water. Sir John Herschel has of late years proposed what seems to be an important improvement on the calorimeter, by filling the interstices of the snow or ice with water, and estimating the quantity of the former melted by the contraction of volume'of the compound mass. I am not aware that it has been as yet practised. I have stated in Art. (88) one ground on which the idea of the calorimeter (so far as not anticipated by Wilcke), may be probably ascribed to Laplace. Another is to be found in the fact that, in the opening of the description of the method in the paper which we are considering, Laplace writes of himself in the first person","Laplace, Laplace, Laplace","US,SE",8,"United States,Sweden","North America,Europe"

"At the age of thirteen he had commenced the ardu- (611.) ous office of an instructor; and from 1781 to 1792 pursued the same occupation in a humble sphere at Kendal, where he fortunately became acquainted with Mr Gough, a blind gentleman of some fortune, who devoted his time to the prosecution of science in nearly all its branches, and particularly of mathe¬ matical subjects, of which he has left an enduring record in many ingenious papers, published chiefly in the Manchester Transactions and in Nicholson's Journal. He patronized young Dalton, giving him free access to his library and apparatus, and receiv¬ ing from him in return the benefit of his assistance in prosecuting his experiments. Dalton always recog¬ nised (as he had unquestionably good reason to do) the merits of his patron, and the importance of the advantages which he had derived from his advice and example. Indeed, without some such fortunate concurrence of circumstances (and something simi¬ lar may be noted in the history of nearly all self- educated men), it could hardly have been hoped that Dalton would have been so well grounded in the ma¬ thematical principles of at least some branches of Natural Philosophy as he probably was. For, though his discoveries bear mainly on the science of chemis¬ try in the wide sense in which it was then under¬ stood, yet geometrical precision is after all their fun¬ damental characteristic ; and whether in treating of the constitution of a gas, or of the scale of a thermo¬ meter, or of the composition of a salt, it is evident that numbers and ratios were the ideas predominating in 1 Life of Dalton, by Dr Henry, in the publications of the Cavendish Society.

"A discovery of Dalton, which has scarcely been (617.) considered second in importance to those we haveDalton on mentioned, is that the rate of expansion of all gases gioi^of the by heat is the same. Thus thermometers of air, hydro- gases by gen, and carbonic acid would all markthesame degree heat- when plunged in the same medium ; whilst the mer¬ curial thermometer shows a more rapid expansion, at higher temperatures, if the air thermometer be taken as the standard. This important fact was soon after but independently announced by Gay-Lussac of Paris. Dalton’s publication dates from 1801. In his Chemical Philosophy, he gives his view of the difficult subject of a true thermometric scale; which he does not suppose to be correctly represented by the simple expansion of any known substance; but that the gases expand with true increments of heat in a very slow geometrical progression, whilst li¬ quids expand as the squares of the true temperatures from their freezing points. These and other laws equally arbitrary have not received support from later and more precise experiments; and in the se¬ cond volume of his work (1827) he freely acknow¬ ledges the correction of his hypothesis by the more recent French experiments","Dalton, Dalton, Paris, Dalton","US,FR",8,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"writers of the recent German school. Abstracting as far as possible from the more purely metaphysical difficulties (such as those which the consideration of Leibnitz’s law of continuity introduces), we may perhaps be justified in stating that, whilst the objec¬ tions urged against the existence of atoms fall upon our inability to conceive and describe the properties of these individual ultimate parts in a consistent manner,—the objections to the other notion meet us at an earlier stage, and seem to defy any clear con¬ ception of the nature or possible existence of com¬ pound bodies, or of bodies in two states of consis¬ tence. Admitting atoms—whilst acknowledging our inability to describe them individually—we can clearly enough conceive the phenomena of condensation, ra¬ refaction, evaporation, &c., and also of the combina¬ tion of elements in compounds possessing distinct properties; but excluding them, or allowing that matter is penetrable by matter throughout, is it pos¬ sible to conceive clearly of such a compound,—as for example, of the perfect diffusion of two gases in the same space, yet each gas retaining its individuality so completely as to admit of easy and complete se- Boscovich. paration from the other ""? The theory of Boscovich, which has been sufficiently touched upon by Sir John Leslie in the previous Dissertation, was intended, no doubt, to reconcile the two opposing theories, and it cannot be doubted that it is in many respects an in¬ genious solution. Yet it is essentially (as Professor Itobison maintains) a corpuscular or atomic doctrine^ and it farther appears to be difficultly reconcilable to the doctrine of inertia; for how can a finite number of unextended physical points, though they may be the centres of intense forces, constitute a finite aggregate mass? Nevertheless this speculation has been on the whole favourably received, and in our own time seems to have been adopted by so eminently practical a philosopher as Dr Faraday",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"A mechanical mixture of gases like the atmosphere is for him a uniform diffusion of the atoms of each gas throughout the space occupied by the whole, and without reference to the position of the atoms of any of the others. But a chemical compound consists of molecules or complex atoms, each composed of two or more ultimate particles of the constituents firmly united by a chemical force, and these complex molecules act towards one another exactly as simple ones might do. The general notion of chemical forces or affinities (as they were perhaps first called by Geoff¬ rey, a French chemist) appears to have been appre¬ hended in two different senses corresponding to the atomic or non-atomic theory of body. For the former proceeds on the assumption of direct attractions or repulsions {jpush-and-pull forces, as they have been called) uniting some and tending to separate others, thus assimilating completely chemical with mechani¬ cal forces. The other school adopts the word affinity as expressing a mode of action of matter upon matter totally distinct from that of force producing motion in its particles, to which it is difficult to give an in¬ telligible form, much more to prove that the assump¬ tion is warranted by the facts.1 In this state of matters the choice between an opinion perhaps erro¬ neous, and one which assumes no definite shape, can hardly, to the practical philosopher, remain long doubtful; when new facts shall have enabled him to express intelligibly a new hypothesis, it will be time enough to adopt it",,FR,8,France,Europe
"(624.) The reception of the views of Dalton was some- tionlrT1*"" w^at gradual, yet might be called rapid, considering England, the obscurity of the author, and his provincial resi¬ dence. The energy of Dr Thomson of Glasgow con¬ tributed more than any other circumstance to com¬ pel the attention of chemists. He personally brought it under the notice of Wollaston and Davy ; and the former, who, by his habits of precise thought and ac¬ curate experiment, as well as from his extensive che¬ mical knowledge, would of all others have been the most likely to see its importance and probability, was doubly predisposed in its favour by having been himself for some time in possession of facts illus¬ trating the numerical laws of combination similar to those which Dalton possessed. Wollaston published these in the Philosophical Transactions for 1808, in which he expressly states, that Dalton had antici¬ pated him in the results of bis enquiry into multiple combinations of elements. Davy, as might have been expected, was less prepared to accept a doctrine having the form of a mathematical law ; he did so, however, after a short resistance. In his Chemical Philosophy he ascribes most if not all the merit of it to Higgins, and is supposed to have looked coldly upon Dalton’s growing fame; but it is gratifying to add, that in almost his last appearance in public as president of the Royal Society, when presenting Dal¬ ton with the first royal medal, he should have ex¬ pressed himself in terms of cordial praise","Dalton, Glasgow, Dalton, Dalton, Dalton","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"939 early as 1816, elected a corresponding member of the Institute of France—Wollaston being then probably the only other English name on the list.1 Dalton found his way to Paris in 1822, and was agreeably surprised by the distinction with which he was re¬ ceived by the most eminent members of the Academy of Sciences. Perhaps this first 'personal recognition of his exalted station, as a man of science, had some¬ thing to do with the tardy adjudication to him four years later of one of the medals of the Royal Society of London.

"Some of his inferences were unguarded enough, and have not been confirmed; and the reception of what were correct was naturally delayed by the evident facility with which his theories were shaped in his own mind. Most of his papers appeared in rapid succession ; only the Atomic Theory was brought with some evident hesitation before the world. In all this we see the results of a vigorous imagination, united with great perseverance, in working out an idea. The imaginative element would have been more under control had his education been of a less irregular kind. We see the effect of an opposite turn in his eminent predecessors just named. They would have done more, had they trusted more. Dal¬ ton’s discoveries may be said to have terminated at the age of forty.

"Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, an eminent French ^ chemist and physicist, contemporary with Dalton, Gay-Lus- has been mentioned in the course of the present sec- sac—che tion, as having discovered independently the equal ""l181 af^ dilatation of the gases, and also a law of their com- ^ binations in connection with their volumes, which was peculiar to himself. Besides these researches, science owes many useful observations in physics to his energy and talent, which, in the origin of his career, promised more of originality than his ma- turer life perfectly fulfilled. He was born in the old province of Limousin in 1778, and became the pupil of Berthollet in chemical researches, and was one of the earliest and most active members of the Societe d’Arceuil.

He introduced great improvements into the management of the army; the mechanical and chemi¬ cal departments of the artillery had a peculiar charm for him ; they were conducted on strictly scientific principles, and, in return, were made to contribute important results to science.

Salutary views of the importance of industry, order, morality, and public economy, were most happily united to a happy versatility of talent in physical research, to unwearied patience and great liberality, in effecting one of the greatest social reforms on record. The strict statistics of a great house of industry were ascertained with reference to the most seemingly in¬ significant details, and, in particular, all the appli¬ cations of Heat to the physical wants of mankind were studied with equal assiduity and success. The warmth of clothing was traced to the amount of still air entangled amongst its fibres,—the dissipation of heat, whether from a thermometer or a kitchen boiler, was classified under radiation, conduction, and con¬ vection, the last and often most important of which (signifying the influence of currents in liquids and gases in conveying heat by the changing density of their parts) had hardly before been recognised, or at least made the subject of formal experiment,—the effective heat due to the combustion of different kinds of fuel, tested by a calorimeter of his own invention, —the economy of light based on an investigation of the properties of flame;—these were but a few of the trains of enquiry, of which his Mendicity House was the primary object.

The plan was conceived with the sagacity which characterized Rumford, and its success has been greater than could have been anticipated. Davy was there brought into notice by Rumford himself, and furnished with the means of prosecuting his admirable experiments",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"As is frequently the case in persons addicted to (643.) natural philosophy, his first original researches were an(i essays connected with mathematics. Playfair, who wason ™athe' eighteen years his senior, encouraged and directed electricity, him; Ivory, who was almost his contemporary, and also his fellow-student at St Andrews, was per¬ haps no less influential in confirming his geometrical tastes. The former communicated Leslie’s first ori¬ ginal paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1788. It was on Indeterminate Equations, and was printed in their Transactions. Down to this period we have no record of his being engaged in original experiments ; but it is probable that such was the case, for in 1790, and the following years, we have evidence not only of his having speculated on subjects of natural philosophy, but also that he had made experiments intended to confirm or refute prevailing theories. A paper on Electrical Theories was read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which, finding them reluctant to print, he withdrew, and he only 1 To Rumford, I believe, is due the attempt (in conformity with this view) to ascertain the heat developed by the friction of fluids, for instance in churning (which, I think, was one experiment proposed by him), but I have not been able to find a reference to it amongst his scattered writings","Edinburgh, Edinburgh",GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"published it more than thirty years after, when cer¬ tainly it was not calculated to advance science in a perceptible degree. An essay on Heat and Climate, read at the meetings of the Royal Society of London in 1793, had not a more favourable reception ; and though published twenty-six years later in Thomson’s Annals, it was refused a place in the Philosophical Transactions. The author, no doubt, attributed these rejections to the boldness with which he criticised opinions currently received, and to the novelty of the views which were shadowed forth ; but something is, no doubt, to be allowed for the real immaturity of these works, the involved and even inflated style in which they were written, and the questionable evi¬ dence for some of the conclusions. In these, and in some subsequent scattered papers in Nicholsons Journal, we observe, with all the faults, yet many of the merits of those researches which afterwards made him justly famous. We find acute observation, in¬ genious, if not close reasoning, considerable inven¬ tiveness in imagining experiments and in constructing apparatus, and a general tendency to express physi¬ cal laws in a mathematical form. It must be con¬ fessed, that these merits were united to a good deal of dogmatism, and a somewhat supercilious judgment of persons eminent in science whose years and at¬ tainments should have commanded respect. This, however, is a fault which many ardent students not very conversant with the world have had abundant occasions to regret at leisure. Whether or not he believed Sir William Herschel to have had some share in the refusal of his paper by the Royal So¬ ciety I do not know, but it is difficult, on other grounds, to understand the bitterness with which he expressed himself as to that eminent person, in con¬ nection with his experiments on heat",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"One of the circumstances which most contributed to encourage Mr Leslie’s taste for experiment, was his engagement for above two years as tutor and companion in the family of the ingenious Mr Wedg¬ wood. Another was the opportunities which he found or made for himself of foreign travel. With or without companions he visited, in the early period of his career, America, and most of the northern countries of Europe, particularly Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway. He also medi¬ tated a journey to Egypt and the East, a project reluctantly abandoned, and to which he reverted even in the last years of his life ; but it was never carried into effect. Nothing, perhaps, fosters so surely a taste for science as such extended tours ; and the acquaintance made under the most agreeable cir¬ cumstances with foreign philosophers, and the fami¬ liarity gained with their language and experiments, contributes to it in no small degree",Holland,"DE,CH,SE,NO,EG,US",8,"Germany,Switzerland,Sweden,Norway,Egypt,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,Europe,Africa,North America"
"We have now come to the period of Mr Leslie’s life when his character and position became esta¬ blished, the first by the publication of his Experi¬ mental Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of Heat, in 1804; the latter by his appointment to the chair of mathematics in the University of Edinburgh in 1805.

The subject was however proposed for a prize, to be decided in 1812, when Fourier’s essay was crowned, but, strange to say, not published. The cause, it is to be feared, lay in the jealousy of the greatest mathematicians of the age.

The manuscript, after lying for twelve years in the archives of the Institute, where it was consulted by different persons, was finally printed, word forward, as it stood in 1812.1 Fourier’s long absence from Paris in a remote provincial town, rendered this in¬ dignity possible at first; and afterwards, it was his misfortune to be unable to hold a political station without offence, amidst the violent intestine conflicts with which France was afflicted. He alternately dis¬ pleased his old master Napoleon and the Bourbons, and the consequence was, that after the Restoration he found himself dispossessed of every employment, master of not one thousand pounds, and refused by the government even a seat at the Institute. This indigence, so honourable to himself, and this neglect, so disgraceful to others, tended, no doubt, to increase an irritability, such as intense mental exertion often produces, and which the injustice of his scientific countrymen had already aggravated. Finally, how¬ ever, he received a modest post connected with the civil administration of the department of the Seine; he was also elected a member of the physical section of the Academy of Sciences, and he finally became perpetual secretary of that body",Paris,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"

"Macedonio Melloni, a native of Parma in Italy, became associated as an experimenter, probably about the year 1828 or 1829, with Nobili, a skilful and ingenious physicist of Reggio (Modena).

"From 1831, this enquiry was conducted nearly (711.) exclusively by Melloni, who about that time settled Melloni first in Geneva and then in Paris, having been com- (llseoveis pelled, on political grounds, to quit Italy. His first derful and most important original memoir was presented trans- to the Academy of Sciences early in 1833, and was rodTsaU^ received with marked coldness, if not incredulity, by for heat, that body. A few months later, the writer of these pages had an opportunity of seeing Melloni’s ex¬ periments in Paris, and he made known their im¬ portance at the immediately succeeding meeting of the British Association at Cambridge. The Royal Society of London in no long time awarded their Rumford medal to Melloni, after which mark of foreign approbation, he first obtained a hearing from the Institute of France. The most consider¬ able result at which he had then arrived was this : that rock-salt possesses a power unapproached by any other substance of transmitting heat of any temperature and from whatever source, with ex¬ tremely little loss ; and as a natural consequence of this, that heat wholly devoid of luminosity, such as that from boiling water, or even the heat of the hand, may be refracted by prisms and lenses of rock-salt exactly in the same manner as light is refracted by glass. The reality of these effects (which had excited the persevering scepticism of the Parisian Savons') was demonstrated by a great number of most inge¬ nious experiments, in which every possible source of error and confusion was avoided or allowed for","Geneva, Paris, Paris, Cambridge, London","US,IT,FR,GB",8,"United States,Italy,France,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Through the intervention of Arago and of Baron (716-) Humboldt, Melloni ultimately obtained permission to return to Italy and to reside at Naples, where he spent his latter years. He ceased, however, to prosecute his researches on radiant heat with the same energy, under circumstances of ease and comparative affluence, that he had done in the period of distress and obscu¬ rity. Nevertheless, several original papers were writ¬ ten by him at this period, as well as the condensed account of his earlier researches on the Coloration of Heat, of which only the first volume appeared.

I have already said, in speaking of Dulong, that, in point of numerical pre¬ cision in the results of experimental physics, the French are unrivalled.

"We must, however, note that doubts were first thrown upon the accuracy of Gay-Lussac’s coefficient Coefficient of the expansion of the gases (0-375 of the vo-°f exPan' lume at 32° for the expansion between 32° and 2120g1°s°s°anfj Fahrenheit) by Rudberg a Swedish philosopher, who mercury ; determined a new coefficient (0-3645).

As a preliminary to these experiments, the expansion of mercury was ascertained by its hy¬ drostatic equilibrium at different temperatures, as had already been done by Dulong, and with almost coincident results. The dilatation of mercury was used to ascertain that of the glass vessels employed",,SE,8,Sweden,Europe

"Revival of Experiments on Animal Electricity.— The grand discovery of Oersted, which gave a fresh im¬ pulse to so many branches of science, revived likewise the subject of the proper electricity of the animal tis¬ sues, which had been well-nigh forgotten since the death of its discoverer Galvani. Twenty-nine years later, in 1827, Nobili of Florence demonstrated the ex¬ istence of what has been termed “ The current of the frog.” We have seen that a momentary spasm is produced when a circuit is completed, including the muscle and nerve of the recently dead animal. But by the aid of that admirable instrument the Galvan¬ ometer, Nobili succeeded in showing that a continu¬ ous current of positive electricity constantly passes from the feet to the head of the frog. This he de¬ tected by placing the feet of the animal in connec¬ tion with one end of the galvanometer wire, and its spine with the other (the whole being properly insu¬ lated), when the needle of the instrument was per¬ manently deflected to the amount of 5° or more— indicating the passage of a stream of electricity in the direction already mentioned, which continued for se¬ veral hours after death. Strange to say, Nobili mis¬ apprehended the nature of the phenomenon, ascrib¬ ing it to Thermo-Electricity, though he ought to have been undeceived by the singular intensity of the animal current, which, feeble as it is, can force its way along thousands of feet, or even some miles of fine wire.2 These experiments were renewed in 1837 by M. (739.) Matteucci of Pisa, who has the merit of reviving the ,Mat' original and cori’ect opinion of Galvani as to the vital Du gois source of this electricity. To his researches, and the Raymond, still later ones of Dr Du Bois Reymond of Berlin, we owe the knowledge of most of the facts as yet ascer¬ tained in this most difficult and obscure branch of enquiry, where the sources of error are so numerous as only to be eluded by consummate skill on the part of the experimenter. It appears to be established that the vital electricity exists both in the muscles and in the nerves of many, probably of all animals when living or recently dead ; that therefore the frog current of Nobili is only a single case of the general muscular current, and that the latter arises from the electro-motive action of even the minutest fibres of which a muscle is composed—the genei'al law being (according to Dr Du Bois Reymond) that positive elec¬ tricity moves from the transverse section to the longi¬ tudinal section of a muscle or a nerve, or any portion of either. Finally, the last-named writer has shown, to the satisfaction of many eminent men who have witnessed his experiments, that powerful muscular contraction, whether induced by stinruli or the result of volition, tends to diminish the force of the natural muscular current. This he demonstrated first on the frog poisoned by strychnine, but afterwards on the muscles of his own arm, in which by voluntary con¬ traction he could diminish at will the force of the natural current, which in the state of rest is directed from the shoulder to the hand","Pisa, Berlin","IT,DE",8,"Italy,Germany","Europe,Europe"

"we find Volta gradually insisting more on the purely mechanical nature of the electrical excitement. The last-named year produced an important letter to Gren of Halle,1 which contains the real germ of the invention of the pile, though it has been little taken notice of. We there find conducting bodies divided into two classes, primary and secondary; the first including metals, metallic ores, and charcoal; the se¬ cond liquids, solutions, animal tissues, &c. The first class he also called motors. Using the prepared frog always as an indicator, he tried the effect of combining three or more elements of the two kinds",Halle,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"But three years seem to have elapsed before he was led to the invention of the pile, although it is in truth nothing more than the same arrangement frequently repeated. In March 1800 he wrote from Como a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, which was printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the same year, and in which he describes the Pile and the Couronne des Tos¬ ses. The former consisted of 20 or more copper or sil¬ ver coins interlaid with as many disks of tin or zinc, and others of paper or leather, soaked in water or brine. The same order of sequence of the three elements was carefully preserved throughout; and the whole formed a vertical pile or rouleau. Several such piles could be used together. The effects were—1. The ready excitement of the common electrometer by the aid of the condenser ; 2. The production of smart shocks through the hands and arms, similar to those pro¬ duced by the torpedo ; 3. The production of vivid sensations of taste, of sound in the ears, and of flashes of light. There was nothing new in these effects (it may be seen) except that their intensity was much exalted, and the verification of the metallic theory was thereby rendered more easy. Volta attributes the action to the effect of “ simple contact” of the me¬ tals, allowing to the fluid element no other share than that of conducting sufficiently, but not too rapidly, the impulse thus excited. Having an eye probably to Fabbroni’s opinions, he insists on the superior effects obtained with saline and alcaline fluids, and with hot in preference to cold fluids, being explicable solely by their increased conducting power. He justly de¬ scribes the effects of the pile as similar to those of an immense electric battery with a very feeble charge; only the action is continuous, instead of intermittent",Como,IT,8,Italy,Europe
"But the invention had scarcely become known in London when the importance of the pile, as an in¬ strument of discovery, was keenly appreciated in consequence of one capital discovery",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"Nicholson suspected it to be hydrogen, and pro¬ posed to break the circuit by enclosing water in a tube between the two wires. This was accordingly done on the 2d May 1800, within a month of the arrival in England of the first four pages of Volta’s letter to Sir J. Banks, which preceded the remainder by a considerable space of time. The brass wire in the water tube, which was connected with the posi¬ tive end of the pile, became tarnished and black, whilst minute bubbles of gas were evolved from the other, to the amount of ygth of a cubic inch in 21- hours. Being mixed with an equal quantity of com¬ mon air, and a lighted waxed thread being applied, it exploded. It was, therefore, concluded to be hy¬ drogen derived from the decomposition of the water, whose oxygen had combined with the brass of the positive wire.1 Nicholson, it appears, was well ac¬ quainted with Fabbroni’s writings on the relation of galvanism to chemical action ; and in the very paper where he describes Volta’s pile and his own discovery, he expresses his astonishment that Volta should have taken no notice of Fabbroni’s results, or of the rapid oxidation of zinc in contact with other metals which appears in the pile, and which had been no¬ ticed by Fabbroni in every case where two metals differing in oxidability are placed in water, and in contact with each other. The experiment was repeated at Vienna, and then by Volta himself, who called attention to an experiment by three Dutch chemists, Pacts, Van Troostwyk, and Dieman, who had decomposed water by common electricity in 1789",Vienna,"US,NL",8,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"

"No scientific discovery ever excited the enthusiasm of Napoleon to the same degree as that of the Pile. Pie even extemporized a theory of life from its phenomena, comparing the vertebral column in man to the pile, the bladder being the posi¬ tive and the liver the negative pole. An eminent medical chemist, Dr Prout, has seriously main¬ tained a somewhat similar hypothesis. The fa¬ vours lavished on Volta excited, perhaps, some jea¬ lousy amongst the French philosophers; for it is remarkable how little was added in France to the progress of the revived science of electricity. The French ruler, however, had himself in some measure to blame for this ; for the rigid exclusion of foreign, and especially of English publications, for a number of years, was felt to be highly injurious, and was in vain remonstrated against by Berthollet and others",,"FR,UK",8,"France,N/A","Europe,N/A"
"Volta survived his great invention above a quar- (756) ter of a century. He died 5th March 1827, aged 82. His death",March,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"His scientific character is easily summed up. He was patient, intelligent, and devoted to science from youth to age. He had, in an eminent degree, that patience and tenacity of purpose and of interest which Newton described as the chief attributes of his own genius. He had the candour which is more especially to be desired in the experimentalist; and he wrote without pretension, and generally clearly, though not without that diffuseness which is often associated with the use of the Italian language even in matters of science. On the other hand, his intellect may be rather described as opening itself to conviction, than as forcing its way by a native power of penetration to great results. His taste and his talent lay far more in experimental than in abstract reasoning. His explanations of the effects which he observed were often involved and obscure; yet he had a very happy talent of combination, which led him to effect what others only talked about. His instru¬ mental inventions, including the pile, were his hap¬ piest efforts. His theories, on the other hand, were surrounded, even in his own mind, with a certain obscurity. Even the contact theory, with its manifold paradoxes, was perhaps only vigorously carried out by him under the excitement of an active contro¬ versy. The invention of the pile may, in very many respects, be placed on a par with that of the steam- engine. The results of the former were indeed more interesting, immediately, to pure science; the latter to the arts of life and the needs of civilization. Yet, after half a century, this distinction can hardly be drawn with severity. The rapid pace of steam is insufficient for our demands. The electric wire con¬ veys to its destination, ere the locomotive has time to start on its journey, tidings of joy and sorrow—life and death—of victories won, and kingdoms lost",,IT,8,Italy,Europe
Sir Humphry Davy was born at Penzance on the 17th December 1778. His was an ardent boyhood,Penzance,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"His^first r^^ie earty PaPers °f Davy refer chiefly to Heat, papers, and Light, and Electricity. He was, in fact, a physicist experi- more than a chemist. Whilst yet a surgeon’s ap- ments on prentice at Penzance, he satisfied himself of the im- oxide. materiality of heat, which he illustrated by some in¬ genious experiments, in which, concurring unawares with the conclusions of his future patron Rumford, he laid one foundation of his promotion. Removed to a sphere of really scientific activity at Clifton, under Dr Beddoes,1 he executed those striking re¬ searches in pneumatic chemistry and the physiologi¬ cal effects of breathing various gases which gave him his first reputation; researches so arduous and full of risk as to require a chemist in the vigour of life, and urged by an unextinguishable thirst for dis¬ covery, to undertake them. Even his brilliant dis¬ covery of the effects of inhaling nitrous oxide brought no competitor into the field; and the use of anses- thetics, which might naturally have followed—the greatest discovery (if we except, perhaps, that of vaccination) for the relief of suffering humanity made in any age—was delayed for another generation","Penzance, Clifton","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"rests. Promoted in 1801 to a situation in the Labo- stitution— ratory of the Royal Institution in London, he attached exPeri- himself to the study of galvanism in the interval of^”^^,011 the other and more purely chemical pursuits which electricity, the duties of his situation required. He had already, at Clifton, made experiments with the pile of Volta, and taken part in the discussion of its theory and effects, then (as we have seen) so actively carried on in Britain. In his papers of that period we find not only excellent experiments, but happy and just rea¬ soning. The chemical theory of the pile—namely, that the electrical effects observed by Galvani and Volta are due solely or chiefly to the chemical ac¬ tion of the fluid element on the metals—was more strongly embraced by him then than afterwards. In November 1800 he concluded that “ the pile of Volta acts only when the conducting substance be¬ tween the plates is capable of oxidating the zinc ; and that in proportion as a greater quantity of oxy¬ gen enters into combination with the zinc in a given time, so in proportion is the power of the pile to de¬ compose water and to give the shock greater.” He concludes that “ the chemical changes connected with” oxidation “ are somehow the cause of the elec¬ trical effect it produces.”2 His views on this sub¬ ject underwent some modification afterwards. In his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, pub! i sh ed twelve years later, we find the following statement of his opinions on the subject:—“ Electrical effects are exhi¬ bited by the same bodies acting as masses, which produce chemical phenomena when acting by their particles ; it is, therefore, not improbable that the primary cause of both may be the same.” A little further on he adds :—“ They,” speaking of electrical and chemical energies, “ are conceived to be dis¬ tinct phenomena, but produced by the same power acting in the one case on masses, in the other on par¬ ticles.”3 1 Davy hit off his principal’s character in a single sentence,—“ Beddoes had talents which would have exalted him to the pin¬ nacle of philosophical eminence, if they had been applied with discretion.’ 2 Works, ii., 162","London, Clifton","GB,US",8,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Such success was fitted to charm a disposition like that of Davy, and more than reward him for all his toils. To have discovered two new bodies, and opened an entirely new field of wide chemical re¬ search, would itself have been enough. But the extraordinary properties of the new bases were such as seemed to correspond to the lively imagination of the Chemist who produced them, and to transport him to an Aladdin’s palace more brilliant than even his fertile imagination had ever conceived. Yet it is pleasing to remember that these popular discoveries followed, at the interval of a year, the patient and t^insU- able researches which led him to them, and which tute of had already been rewarded, at a period of the bitter- France",,FR,8,France,Europe
"He had in a space of ten years attained the pinnacle of scientific reputation, and he was for the time truly happy :—unenvious of others—deeply attached to his relatives—generous of his resources—unwearied in his philosophic labours. A certain change (it must with regret be owned) came over his state of mind, tarnished his serenity, and gradually though imperceptibly weakened his scientific zeal. It was to be ascribed solely, we believe, to the severe ordeal of exuberant but heartless popularity which he un¬ derwent in London. The flatteries of fashionable life acting on a young, ardent, and most susceptible mind, mingling first with the graver applause of his philosophic compeers, and at length, by their reitera¬ tion and seductions quite overpowering it, by degrees attached Davy to the fashionable world, and loosened his ties to that laboratory which had once been to him the sole and fit scene of his triumphs. Had he been blest with a family, his course would probably have been evener and happier. Let us not severely criti¬ cise, where we still find so much to admire and to imi¬ tate. But we record the fact, for the consolation of those who, beginning the pursuit of science, as Davy did, in a humble sphere, and with pure ardour, may fancy that they are worthy of pity, if they do not at¬ tain with him the honours of wealth and title, and the homage, grateful to talent, of rank, wit, and beauty",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"A research, second perhaps only to his electro- (769.) chemical discoveries, remains to be noticed, as the Third pe- chief fruit of the third period of his life, on which we of hls now enter ; the first being his early career before settling in London; the second, that passed in the Royal Institution",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

"be incapable of causing explosion. The former of these modes of protection, it was soon seen, could only be palliative; the only efficient form which it took, was that of a more effectual ventilation ; but the ter¬ rific rapidity with which a mine may be suddenly in¬ vaded by fire-damp, from channels opened by a single blow of the pickaxe, must prevent it from ever act¬ ing as a cure. The latter plan had as yet yielded nothing more effectual than the steel mill long used by miners, which produced an uncertain and inter¬ mitting light, by the rotation of a steel wheel against a flint, the scintillations of which were incapable of inflaming the fire-damp. The insufficiency of the light prevented it from being used, except in circum¬ stances of known danger. The celebrated Baron Humboldt, Dr Clanny, and several others, had in¬ vented safety-lamps on different principles ; but they were all clumsy and more or less ineffectual.1 At last, in the summer of 1815, the Rev. Dr Gray (afterwards Bishop of Bristol), then chair¬ man of a committee appointed by a benevolent as¬ sociation at Bishop Wearmouth for the prevention of colliery accidents, applied to Davy, who was then on a sporting tour in Scotland, requesting his advice and assistance. Sir Humphry answered the call with promptitude. On his southward journey, in the latter part of August, he visited the collieries, ascer¬ tained the circumstances of the danger which he had to meet, and was provided by Mr Buddie with speci¬ mens of the inflammable air for examination. Within a fortnight after his return to London, he had ascer¬ tained new and important qualities of the substance, and had already four schemes on hand for the pre¬ vention of accident. Before the end of October, he had arrived at the following principles of operation in connection with a safety-lamp. “ First, A certain mixture of azote and carbonic acid prevents the ex¬ plosion of the fire-damp, and this mixture is neces¬ sarily formed in the safe-lantern ; secondly, The fire¬ damp will not explode in tubes or feeders of a certain small diameter. The ingress to, and egress of air from my lantern,” he adds, “ is through such tubes or feed¬ ers ; and, therefore, when an explosion is artificially made in the safe lantern, it does not communicate to the external air.” The effect of narrow tubes in inter¬ cepting the passage of flame, is due to the cooling effect of their metallic sides upon the combustible gases of which flame is composed ;2 * and one of his first and most important observations was the fortunate pecu¬ liarity that fire-damp, even when mixed with the amount of air most favourable to combustion (1 part of gas to 7 or 8 of air), requires an unusually high temperature to induce combination. Olefiant gas, carbonic oxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen, are all in¬ flamed by iron at a red heat, or ignited charcoal, but carburetted hydrogen does not take fire under a per¬ fect white heat. The earliest safety-lamp consisted of a lantern with horn or glass sides, in which a current of air to supply the flame was admitted below by numerous tubes of small diameter, or by narrow in¬ terstices between concentric tubes of some length ; or, finally, by rows of parallel partitions of metal, form¬ ing rectangular canals extremely narrow in propor¬ tion to their length. A similar system of escape apertures was applied at the top of the lantern","Bristol, London","US,GB",8,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"He continued to write poetry nearly all his life, and the tone of it was that of grave speculation, always reverting to the destiny of man and the beneficence of the Creator. His lectures were composed with care; and their effect, even as pieces of oratory, was striking. Coleridge frequented them “ to increase his stock of metaphors—yet they were always to the point, and never degenerated into rhetorical dis¬ play. For a man of such extraordinary liveliness of fancy and impetuosity of action, his mistakes were astonishingly few. After his very first experience, his publications were made with great care and judg¬ ment. His estimates of his contemporaries appear generally to have been fair and liberal, though it would be incorrect to affirm that he was universally popular among them. The combination of isolated and intense occupation in his laboratory, with ex¬ citement in the mixed society of an admiring London public, was a trial which few, if any, could have escaped better than he did ; and so far as we can judge of a man from his expressed opinion of his own successes, whether recorded in his works or in his intimate correspondence, Davy must be accounted to have acquitted himself gracefully and well. He always spoke of the Pile of Yolta as the first source of his own success. “ Nothing tends so much to the advancement of knowledge as the application of a new instrument,” he says; and then adds, “ The native intellectual powers of men in different times are not so much the causes of the different success of their labours, as the peculiar nature of the means and artificial resoui'ces in their possession a proposition 1 There appears, however, to have been something erroneous in the details of Fabbroni’s observations, or at least in the account of them given in Nicholson/s Journal",London,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe

Being intended for the medical pro¬ fession, he soon after wrote some chemical papers, and, in 1801, his first “ On Galvanic Electricity.” But his turn of mind at this time, as well as later, was of a strongly metaphysical cast, and of course tinctured with the peculiarities of the German school as regards the study of physics, of which the title of his thesis on graduation may be given as an instance :—It was On the Architectonicks of Natural Metaphysics. His studies in voltaic elec¬ tricity were made chiefly under Ritter, an obscure and mystical writer, though the author of some cu¬ rious experiments on what were called Secondary Piles ; and he at length obtained, in 1806, a pro¬ fessorship in his own university ; but his associates appear to have been rather literary than scientific persons, such as Steffens, Oehlenschlager, Niebuhr, and Fichte ; he also engaged in controversies of a theological tendency, which, to the end of his life, appear to have had a great attraction for him","University, Copenhagen","US,DK,DE",8,"United States,Denmark,Germany","North America,Europe,Europe"

In 1812 Oersted visited Berlin, and published His first there a work on Chemical and Electrical forces, tend- wmingson jngbj prove their identity, which was translated into e ectricity, py ]y[arce} (je gerres. The author afterwards looked back to the period of the publication of this treatise as the dawn of his electro-magnetic discovery",Berlin,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"Professor Forchhammer, the friend and pupil (790.) of Oersted, states that, in 1818 and 1819, it was IIls disc0* well known in Copenhagen that he was engaged eiYctro- in a special study of the connection of magnetism magnetism, and electricity. Yet we must ascribe it to a happy impulse—the result, no doubt, of much anxious thought—that, at a private lecture to a few advanced students in the winter of 1819—20, he made the ob¬ servation, that a wire uniting the ends of a voltaic battery in a state of activity, affected a magnet in its vicinity. It was in the fact of the circuit being closed, that the main difference consisted between this and previous attempts, in which galvanic pairs or bat¬ teries not connected by conductors were expected to show magnetical relations, though, in such a case, the electricity was evidently stagnant",Copenhagen,DK,8,Denmark,Europe
"974 nal, Oersted took no immediate measures either to complete or to publish his discovery. Some months appear to have elapsed whilst waiting for the conve¬ nience of a larger battery before he repeated the ex¬ periment with the aid of Professor Esmark and other friends. The battery then employed contained 20 twelve-inch elements, charged with water and ^th of mixed nitric and sulphuric acids. The conducting wire was heated red hot, which must have rather dimi¬ nished the effect than otherwise. The nature of the wire was found to be unimportant. If positive electri¬ city passed from north to south through a conducting wire placed horizontally in the magnetic meridian, then a compass needle suspended over it had its north end deviated to the west; if under it, to the east; if the needle was placed on the east side of the conduc¬ tor, its north end was raised ; if on the west side, it was depressed. Oersted further found that needles of non-magnetic substances, such as brass and gum- lac, were not affected, and that the electrical efficiency depended on the quantity, not the intensity, of the current. These experiments seem to have been made in July 1820 ; and Oersted and his friends being now fully alive to the novelty and importance of the dis¬ covery,he circulated extensively copies of a Latin tract, dated the 21st July,in which the effects of the “electric conflict,” as he terms the presumed combination of the opposite electricities in the “ conjunctive wire” upon a magnet, were described.1 In this tract we find the following expressions :—“ The electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.” “ It resembles a helix.” “ The electric conflict is not confined to the conduct¬ ing wire, but it has around it a sphere of activity of considerable extent.” (792.) The effect of this pamphlet, consisting of a few Speedily pages only, was instantaneous and wonderful. The talcen up auth0r probably counted on the opportunity of devel- pLe,m oping his discovery at leisure, but it was seized on Arago, and with such avidity, and pursued with such signal suc- ^avy- cess, particularly in France, that he probably gave up the race of invention in despair. Ampere had already communicated experiments to the Institute on the 18th and 26 th September. Arago and Davy sepa¬ rately, and but little later, discovered the magnetiz¬ ing power which the voltaic conductor exerted on iron filings, and the latter tried in vain the magnetizing power of common or machine electricity, which, how¬ ever, was soon after shown by Arago, who enclosed steel wires in helices of copper wire, through which the discharges were passed. When soft iron was placed in such a helix, it was found to become a tem¬ porary magnet of great power whilst the voltaic cummt continued. Thus magnets of enormously greater power than any previously known were con¬ structed ; one of the first large ones was made by Pro¬ fessor Henry of the United States",,"FR,US",8,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Andre Marie Ampere was born in 1775 at Lyon. (794.) He was an able mathematician, and wrote several Electro¬ memoirs on Chances, and on the Integration of Par- ^oryof tial Differential Equations. But with this he com- Ampere, bined a taste for, and a practical acquaintance with, the experimental sciences. He was a very good che¬ mist, and showed himself particularly attentive to Davy on his first visit to Paris. He was also much attached to metaphysical speculation. His skill in devising apparatus and in performing experiments was eminently shown in his electro-magnetic researches ; whilst he judiciously rendered his mathematical knowledge subservient to them. In this respect he had greatly the advantage of Oersted, who appears to have been little acquainted with mathematics, and, perhaps, in common with his metaphysical friends of the German school, misapprehended their utility in physical discoveries. Three different hypotheses Various were speedily broached to represent mechanically °Pinion8 the singular kind of force mutually exerted between Mature a conductor and a magnet. The first and most ob- 0f the elec- vious was, that this action was not a ■push-and-pulltro-m&g- force, but a force producing rotation without directnetic force• attraction and repulsion, or of the nature of a couple exerted between any part of an electric current, and a small magnet or magnetic element. The second opinion was, that an electric current may be esteemed equivalent to a magnetizing force at right angles to it. The third, that a magnet is composed of ele¬ ments which act as if a closed electric circuit ex¬ isted independently within each of them ; that is, each magnetic molecule may be replaced by a small conducting wire bent upon itself, in which some un¬ failing source of electricity, like a galvanic pair, keeps up, in the same direction, a constant current","Lyon, Paris","FR,US,DE",8,"France,United States,Germany","Europe,North America,Europe"
"(802.) An application of electro-magnetism of extreme Invention importance, was the Multiplier or Galvanometer, galvan- contrived by Schweigger of Halle. In it the idea ometer— was first realized of measuring the power of an Schweig- electric current by its effect in deviating a mag¬ netic needle. Schweigger perceived that he could multiply the action of one and the same current, by causing it to traverse successive parallel coils of the conducting wire carried round the needle. Its sensibi¬ lity was still farther, and almost indefinitely increased byNobili’s invention of rendering the needle asiaZic, or diminishing its natural directive power in any required degree. This he did by connecting it firmly with a second needle parallel to the first, of nearly equal strength, with its poles placed in an inverted posi¬ tion relatively to the other, and moving freely in a plane altogether exterior to the coil, so that whilst the directive effect of the earth’s polarity is almost neutralized, the electro-magnetic effect of the coil tends to produce a similar deviation in both needles",Halle,DE,8,Germany,Europe

Leaving England to travel in the autumn of the same year, Davy engaged Mr Faraday to accompany him as secretary and scien¬ tific assistant; they returned in April 1815, and from that time to the present Mr Faraday has been constantly engaged in the scientific business of the Royal Institution, which is as completely associated with his numerous and splendid dis¬ coveries as Cambridge is with those of Newton, and Slough with those of the elder Herschel. By a rare, perhaps unexampled good fortune, that esta¬ blishment, founded principally for the promotion of original research and the promulgation of dis¬ coveries, has been indebted during the first fifty years of its existence to the talents of two men only, for a succession of new scientific truths which might have done credit to a whole academy; indeed, if to the names of Davy and Mr Faraday we add that of Young, who here first promulgated the doc¬ trines of the Interference of Light, there is scarcely an academy in Europe which has within the same period added so extensively to our choicest stock of original science","March, Cambridge, Newton, Slough, Young","GB,US,UY",8,"United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay","Europe,North America,South America"
"From these strictly experimental laws, Dr Fara¬ day considers that he is entitled to draw these im¬ portant inferences : First, that the source of voltaic electricity in the pile is chemical action solely; Secondly, that “the forces termed chemical affinity and electricity are one and the same.”1 Itis needless to add that these conclusions, involving the very essence of the science of voltaic electricity, are supported by Mr Faraday by a great variety of collateral proofs ; and, on the whole, I cannot see that they admit of any reasonable doubt. The contact theory of Volta still, however, holds its ground in Germany, where the number of influential writers on electricity is con¬ siderable ; and so perseveringly is it maintained, that it is difficult to perceive how it is ever to be dis¬ lodged.

"Let a copper conducting wire of half a mile long be so convoluted that the middle and the two ends of the wire may be brought near together, the whole being perfectly insulated. Let the wire be slightly in¬ terrupted at these three places, and the whole put into connection at pleasure with an electric machine or battery. When contact is made, three sparks will take place. Let the two end sparks be called A and C and the middle one B. As the three sparks take place close to each other, they can easily be seen at once reflected in a small plane mirror. Let now this small mirror be put in very rapid rotation round a hori¬ zontal axis so placed that the sparks (if they occur in the suitable part of the revolution) may be reflected together to the eye. Imagine the rotation to become immensely rapid:—in Mr Wheatstone’s apparatus the velocity reached 800 times in a second; conse¬ quently the mirror described 1° in mo x awth part of a second; i. e., in °f a second. But for 1° of rotation of a mirror the reflected image will describe an arc of 2°. Supposing then that all the sparks occur at the same absolute instant of time, they will be seen in one line (supposing the points of the inter¬ rupted circuit in a line), but if either spark occur later than the others by only of a second, the mirror will have revolved so much in the interval as to displace the image of that spark relatively to the others by the very palpable angular amount of 2°. In the copper wire half a mile long, the end sparks occurred simultaneously, whilst the middle spark occurred later by about one millionth of a second ; giving a velocity of transmission (according to Mr W.) of 288,000 miles a second, or somewhat greater than that of light.1 * The velocity in an iron telegraph-wire, ascertained lately in America with much greater accuracy, and by a different method, is only 16,000 English miles a second; but doubts have been thrown upon the correct interpretation of these experiments. Those of M. Fizeau on the telegraphic lines of France give results more conformable to Mr W'heatstone’s, namely, about 70,000 English miles per second for iron, and 120,000 for copper wire.

Steinheil in 1838; but, from some cause or other, it obtained little publicity; nor does the author appear to have ex¬ erted himself to remove the reasonable prejudices with which so singular a paradox was naturally re¬ ceived. A most ingenious artist, Mr Bain, estab¬ lished for himself the principle, and proclaimed its application somewhat later; and in 1843, perhaps the first entirely convincing experiments were made by M. Matteucci at Pisa. From this time the double wire required to move the needle telegraph was reduced to a single one. The explanation of this curious fact appears to be,—not that the electricity is conducted back by the earth to its origin at the battery,—but that the molecular disturbance po- larly communicated along the conducting wire to its farther end being effectually relieved by perfect com¬ munication with a vast reservoir of neutral electri¬ city like the earth, conduction proceeds in an unin¬ terrupted manner, and to an unlimited extent","London, Brighton, Brighton, Brighton, Pisa","US,GB,IT",8,"United States,United Kingdom,Italy","North America,Europe,Europe"
"Of submarine telegraphs, it is sufficient to state (860.) that the isolation is obtained by inserting the con- Submarine ducting wires in a mass of gutta percha, and that the first on a considerable scale was sunk between Dover and Cape Gris Nez, on the French coast, in August 1851","Of, Dover","TR,US,FR",8,"Turkey,United States,France","Asia,North America,Europe"
"2 I ought to mention that the practical introduction of the electric telegraph in England is in no small degree due to the energy of Mr Fothergill Cooke, joint patentee with Mr Wheatstone for the invention. The question of the respective shares of these gentlemen in the merit of telegraphic communication was submitted, in 1841, to the arbitration of Sir Marc Brunei and the late Mr Daniell, the result of which appears to leave the preponderance of merit in some respects ambiguous ; neverthe¬ less, in a history of Science, Mr Wheatstone is clearly entitled to the pre-eminent place. Several pamphlets have also been sub¬ sequently published by the parties. It is significant that Mr Cooke admits having borrowed his idea from becoming acquainted, at Heidelberg, in March 1836, with Gauss’s experiments","Heidelberg, March","BN,ZA,GB",8,"Brunei Darussalam,South Africa,United Kingdom","Asia,Africa,Europe"
"IV. To M. J acobi—almost simultaneously with Mr (868.) Spencer of Liverpool—we are also indebted for one Electr°- of the simplest and most elegant applications of elec- voUatype • tricity, the Galvano-plastic art, or Voltatype. In —MAE Ja-’ this, advantage is taken of the perfectly metallic state col,i and in which the base of a metallic salt is deposited at sPencer- the negative pole of a voltaic combination. In the case, for example, of the decomposition of sulphate of copper, the sulphuric acid unites with the positive wire, or remains suspended, while the metallic cop¬ per is slowly and homogeneously deposited on the surface of any object (rendered conducting by the application of black lead or otherwise), of which it forms a perfect mould, from which a fresh cast or facsimile in metal of the original object may be ob¬ tained by a repetition of the process. To see the veins of a leaf, or the delicate wing of an insect, thus metallized, is certainly an astonishing thing; and the applications to the useful arts are far too nume¬ rous to be noticed here. Daniell’s invention of the Constant Battery evidently suggested the Voltatype",Liverpool,GB,8,United Kingdom,Europe
"faven- 0f other matter with a force varying inversely as some electrical ^ess Power the distance than the cube. Common theory and matter repels its own particles and attracts electric experi- particles according to the same law. The limitation ments. ag a p0wer below the inverse cube of the distance is necessary, since were the decrease of force more rapid, a particle would not be sensibly affected by the repulsion of any portion of the fluid except what was placed close to it. The hypothesis of Cavendish and his mode of reasoning from it wrere in general the same as those of iEpinus; hut Cavendish was not aware of the researches of the Swedish philosopher until his own memoir was completed. The number of facts accurately ascertained concerning electricity was at that time too small to admit of very precise numerical comparisons, but the ordinary cases of at¬ traction, repulsion, and induction, were perspicuously explained by the theory ; and had the inverse square of the distance been assumed (as it very safely might have been) to represent the law of diminishing re¬ pulsion, several of the theorems would have as¬ sumed a much more definite character, as was shown by Robison. Cavendish first demonstrated in his paper of 1771 that electricity must be confined close to the surface of a spherical body",,SE,8,Sweden,Europe

Professor Barlow of Woolwich led the way in attempting practically to correct the errors thence arising.

"Professor Christopher Hansteen, of Christiania, It results from these charts that the Line of No Va- Line of No in Norway, is the person who has given pro- riation, which, in 1600, formed a remarkable arch- 'nation, bably the greatest impulse in recent times to like curve, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the efforts to methodize the facts and laws of near the North Cape of Norway, then descending the earth’s magnetism.

"(885.) A third element not less important than Variation Magnetic and Dip, though more lately brought into notice, is intensity. intensity 0f garth’s magnetism, and to this Pro¬ fessor Hansteen directed special attention. That the intensity of the earth’s directive force may be mea¬ sured by counting the oscillations of a suspended magnet in the same way that a pendulum measures gravity was known to Graham, Lambert, and others, towards the middle of the last century ; but the ex¬ ploration of its variation on the earth’s surface was first attempted by the officers of Laperouse in 1785, and later by De Rossel. But it was Baron Hum¬ boldt who, at the instigation of Borda,1 undertook the earliest observations which have had any perma¬ nent influence on this branch of science, and who in the first years of this century determined the rela- Baron tive intensity of the earth’s magnetism at Paris and Hum- at the magnetic equator in South America, to be in boldt’8 the ratio of 1’3482 to 1-0000; 2 * a result which has un^' become, so to speak, classical, and which the author considered as the most important result of his jour¬ ney.^ M. Hansteen promoted the same enquiry ex¬ tensively ; he devised a neat and convenient apparatus for counting the oscillations of the needles, and he investigated the effects of time and temperature in altering their magnetism.4 He made numerous ob¬ servations in the north of Europe, and finally under¬ took, between 1827 and 1829 (by the liberality of the Norwegian parliament or Storthing), an adven¬ turous journey into Siberia, for the purpose of exa¬ mining the “ region of convergence” of the needle in that quarter.

"Periodic; 3. Irregular. All the three magnetic ele¬ ments (Variation, Dip, and Intensity) probably par¬ take of these changes. The westerly Variation or De¬ clination had till 1818 been increasing in Europe since the earliest observations. This results from a com¬ plicated movement of the line of No Variation and its companion curves. While their common centre or pole in North America has been slowly advancing towards the East, a considerable portion of the sys¬ tem of curves in this quarter of the globe has been proceeding in a south-westerly direction nearly in a line joining Spain with South America, thus produc¬ ing a complicated rotatory motion of the lines of Va¬ riation, of which the first effect was to extinguish the singular loop in the curve of No Declination (in¬ cluding a space of easterly declination) which is shown in M. Hansteen's clmxt for 1600 to have occupied a large part of Western Europe.2 About 1818 the needle began to retrograde towards the east in this part of Europe. The dip has been dimi¬ nishing in Europe since the earliest observations",,ES,8,Spain,Europe
"Next to Professor Hansteen, science is mainly in¬ debted for the recent great extension of our know¬ ledge of the facts and laws of terrestrial magnetism to two illustrious German philosophers, Baron Alex¬ ander von Humboldt and the late Professor Gauss",,DE,8,Germany,Europe
"From 1808 to 1826 Baron Humboldt resided mainly in Paris, in the most intimate companionship with Arago, who, though much his junior, has predeceased him. He then took up his residence at Berlin, in compliance with the wish of the King of Prussia, and he soon after delivered there a course of public lec¬ tures on Physical Geography which formed the basis of his remarkable work entitled Kosmos, the compo¬ sition of which has formed the chief occupation of his vigorous old age. In 1829 he made a rapid but in¬ teresting journey into Asiatic Russia, important in its results, yet imperfectly carrying out the ardent aspiration of his early years to unfold the marvellous physical peculiarities of the Eastern continent","Paris, Berlin","US,DE",8,"United States,Germany","North America,Europe"
"He commenced observations on this subject in con¬ junction with M. Oltmanns as early as 1806 ; and during his residence in Paris he no doubt encouraged his friend Arago in those elaborate observations on the hourly variations of the needle which, to the irreparable loss of science, remained unpublished whilst they might have been most useful.2 * In 1829 simultaneous observations were made in Germany and Russia, and compared by MM. de Humboldt, Dove, and others, with interesting results.8 It is probable that the results then obtained instigated Gauss to the enlarged enquiry to which I shall imme¬ diately refer. M. de Humboldt had already addressed the Russian Government on the same subject, sug¬ gesting the registration of hourly observations in their vast territories; and these, the first systematic'ob¬ servations of the kind, have been continued ever since. The suggestion of “ Term Days” of continuous registration of the Declination Needle was also due to Baron Humboldt. In 1836 he addressed the President of the Royal Society of London on the same subject, and his letter formed the basis of the exten¬ sive undertakings which have formed the contribu¬ tion of the British Government to this great enquiry","Paris, London","DE,RU,US,GB",8,"Germany,Russian Federation,United States,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe,North America,Europe"

"But to obtain the data of the empirical theory with exactness, it is evident that expeditions fitted out ex¬ pressly with accurate apparatus, and directed at once to many points of the habitable globe, are indispen¬ sable. Powerful governments can alone effect this ; and to Baron Humboldt is due (as has been shown) the praise of having vigorously pressed the import¬ ance of these upon the governments of England and of Russia. The vast marine resources of the former, and the peculiar magnetic interest of the stupendous Asiatic territory of the latter, rendered their co¬ operation highly important. In the result, Great Britain has accomplished by far the larger share of this vast enterprise",,RU,8,Russian Federation,Europe
"In Europe national, and even private, observa¬ tories have contributed largely to our knowledge of the laws of magnetism. Among these observatories may be mentioned Greenwich, Dublin, Makerstoun in Scotland, Munich, Prague, Brussels, St Peters-^ burg, and the numerous other Russian stations.
