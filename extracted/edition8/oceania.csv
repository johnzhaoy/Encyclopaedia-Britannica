"I have said, that the study of Medicine forms one of the best preparations for the study of Mind, to such an understanding as Locke's. To an understanding less comprehensive, and less cultivated by a liberal education, the effect of this study is likely to he similar to what we may trace in the works of Hartley, Darwin, and Cabanis; to all of whom we may more or less apply the sarcasm of Cicero on Aristoxcnus, the Musician, who attempted to explain the nature of the soul by comparing it to a Harmony; Hie AB ARTIFICIO SUO NON RECESSIT.5 In Locke’s Essay, not a single passage occurs, savouring of the Anatomical Theatre, or of the Chemical Laboratory","Darwin, Cicero","AU,US",8,"Australia,United States","Oceania,North America"
"In the University of Cambridge, on the other hand, the Essay on Human Understanding was, for many years, regarded with a reverence ap¬ proaching to idolatry; and to the authority of some distinguished persons connected with that learned body may be traced (as will afterwards appear) the origin of the greater part of the ex¬ travagancies which, towards the close of the last century, were grafted on Locke’s errors, by the disciples of Hartley, of Law, of Priestley, of Tooke, and of Darwin.2 To a person who now reads with attention and candour the work in question, it is much more easy to enter into the prejudices which at first opposed themselves to its complete success, than to conceive how it should so soon have acquired its just celebrity. Something, I suspect, must be ascribed to the political importance which Mr Locke had previously acquired as the champion of religious toleration; as the great apostle of the Revolution ; and as the intrepid opposer of a tyranny which had been recently overthrown","University, Cambridge, Darwin","US,AU",8,"United States,Australia","North America,Oceania"
"According to this distinction, Locke, notwithstanding some occasional slips of his pen, belongs indisputably to the class of Cartesians; as well as the very small number of his followers who have entered thoroughly into the spirit of his philo¬ sophy. To the class of Gassendists, on the other hand, belong all those French metaphysicians, who professing to tread in Locke’s footsteps, have derived all their knowledge of the Essay on Human Understanding from the works of Condillac; together with most of the commentators on Locke who have proceeded from the school of Bishop Law. To these may be added (among the writers of later times) Priestley, Darwin, Beddoes, and, above all, Horne Tooke with his numerous disciples",Darwin,"AU,FR",8,"Australia,France","Oceania,Europe"
"prior to experience, and independent of instruc¬ tion,” “ that the sexes of animals seek each other; that animals cherish their offspring1 2 3; that the young quadruped is directed to the teat of its dam; that birds build their nest, and brood with so much patience upon their eggs; that insects, which do not sit upon their eggs, deposit them in those particular situations in which the young, when hatched, find their ap¬ propriate food; that it is instinct which carries the salmon, and some other fish, out of the sea into rivers, for the purpose of shedding their spawn in fresh water.”1 In Dr Paley’s very able and convincing rea¬ sonings on these various points, he has undoubt¬ edly approached nearer to the spirit of what has been ironically called Scottish philosophy,4 than any of Mr Locke’s English disciples, since the time of Dr Butler; a circumstance which, when compared with the metaphysical creed of his ear¬ lier years, reflects the greatest honour on the can¬ dour and fairness of his mind, and encourages the hope, that this philosophy, where it is equally sound, will gradually and silently work its way among sincere inquirers after truth, in spite of the strong prejudices which many of our south¬ ern neighbours still appear to entertain against it. The extravagancies of Darwin, it is pro¬ bable, first opened Dr Paley’s eyes to the dan¬ gerous tendency of Locke’s argument against innate principles, when inculcated without due limitations.5 With this very faint outline of the specula¬ tions of Locke’s chief successors in Scotland, prior to the close of Dr Reid’s literary labours, i shall for the present finish my review of the metaphysical pursuits of the eighteenth century",Darwin,AU,8,Australia,Oceania
"Mr Macvey Napier. Having already resolved to devote the remainder of his labours to British history, he had considerable difficulty in acceding to the proposal. But his love of the subject, his natural wish to preserve some of his early reading and reflec¬ tions, and the entreaties of Mr Napier, who had a few years before been introduced to him by Mr Stewart, and with whom he was in the habit of corresponding, prevailed over his scruples, and an agreement in consequence took place for the execution of an historical Dissertation, embracing this object, and extending over the period that had been left untouched by his predecessor. It had originally been agreed, as above stated, that the Dissertation should include political as well as ethical philosophy, but the au¬ thor’s uncertain health, and the parliamentary duties of an interesting crisis, occasioned the abandonment of this part of the plan, and even obliged him to omit the history of the ethical philosophy of the Continent",Napier,"NZ,GB",8,"New Zealand,United Kingdom","Oceania,Europe"

"As the accuracy of astronomical observation had been continually advancing, it was necessary that the correctness of trigonometrical calcula¬ tion, and of course its difficulty, should advance in the same proportion. The signs and tangents of angles could not be expressed with sufficient correctness without decimal fractions, extending to five or six places below unity; and when to three such numbers a fourth proportional was to he found, the work of multiplication and division became extremely laborious. Accordingly, in the end of the sixteenth century, the time and labour consumed in such calculations had become excessive, and were felt as extremely burdensome by the mathematicians and astronomers all over Europe. Napier of Merchiston, whose mind seems to have been peculiarly turned to arithme¬ tical researches, and who was also devoted to the study of astronomy, had early sought for the means of relieving himself and others from this difficulty. He had viewed the subject in a varie¬ ty of lights, and a number of ingenious devices had occurred to him, by which the tediousness of arithmetical operations might, more or less completely, be avoided. In the course of these attempts, he did not fail to observe, that when¬ ever the numbers to be multiplied or divided were terms of a geometrical progression, the pro¬ duct or the quotient must also be a term of that progression, and must occupy a place in it point¬ ed out by the places of the given numbers, so that it might be found from mere inspection, if the progression were far enough continued. If, for instance, the third term of the progression were to be multiplied by the seventh, the pro¬ duct must be the tenth; and if the twelfth were to be divided by the fourth, the quotient must be the eighth; so that the multiplication and division of such terms was reduced to the addi¬ tion and subtraction of the numbers which in¬ dicated their places in the progression",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"This observation, or one very similar to it, was made by Archimedes, and was employed by that great geometer to convey an idea of a num¬ ber too vast to be correctly expressed by the arithmetical notation of the Greeks. Thus far, however, there was no difficulty; and the dis¬ covery might certainly have been made by men much inferior either to Napier or Archimedes",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"What remained to be done, what Archimedes did not attempt, and what Napier completely performed, involved two great difficulties. It is plain, that the resource of the geometrical pro¬ gression was sufficient, when the given numbers were terms of that progression; but if they were not, it did not seem that any advantage could be derived from it. Napier, however, perceiv¬ ed, and it was by no means obvious, that all numbers whatsoever might be inserted in the progression, and have their places assigned in it","Napier, Napier",NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"I need not observe, that the numbers which indicate the places of the terms of the geome¬ trical progression are called by Napier the loga¬ rithms of those terms",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"Various systems of logarithms, it is evident, may be constructed according to the geometrical progression assumed; and of these, that which was first contrived by Napier, though the simplest, and the foundation of the rest, was not so convenient for the purposes of calculation, as one which soon afterwards occurred, both to him¬ self and his friend Briggs, by whom the actual calculation was performed. The new system of logarithms was an improvement, practically considered; but in as far as it was connected with the principle of the invention, it is only of secondary consideration. The original tables had been also somewhat embarrassed by too close a connection between them and trigono¬ metry. The new tables were free from this in¬ convenience",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"It is probable, however, that the greatest in¬ ventor in science was never able to do more than to accelerate the progress of discovery, and to anticipate what time, “ the author of authors,” would have gradually brought to light. Though logarithms had not been invented by Napier, they would have been discovered in the progress of the algebraic analysis, when the arithmetic of powers and exponents, both integral and frac¬ tional, came to be fully understood. The idea of considering all numbers as powers of one given number would then have readily occurred, and the doctrine of series would have greatly facilitated the calculations which it was neces¬ sary to undertake. Napier had none of these advantages, and they were all supplied by the resources of his own mind. Indeed, as there never was any invention for which the state of knowledge had less prepared the way, there never was any where more merit fell to the share of the inventor","Napier, Napier",NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania
"His good fortune, also, not less than his great sagacity, may be remarked. Had the invention of logarithms been delayed to the end of the seventeenth century, it would have come about without effort, and would not have conferred on the author the high celebrity which Napier so justly derives from it. In another respect he has also been fortunate. Many inventions have been eclipsed or obscured by new discoveries; or they have been so altered by subsequent im¬ provements, that their original form can hardly be recognised, and, in some instances, has been entirely forgotten. This has almost always hap¬ pened to the discoveries made at an early period in the progress of science, and before their prin¬ ciples were fully unfolded. It has been quite otherwise with the invention of logarithms, which came out of the hands of the author so perfect, that it has never received but one ma¬ terial improvement,—that which it derived, as has just been said, from the ingenuity of his friend in conjunction with his own. Subsequent improvements in science, instead of offering any thing that could supplant this invention, have only enlarged the circle to which its utility extended. Logarithms have been applied to numberless purposes, which were not thought of at the time of their first construction. Even the sagacity of their author did not see the immense fertility of the principle he had dis¬ covered : he calculated his tables merely to facilitate arithmetical, and chiefly trigonome¬ trical computation; and little imagined that he was at the same time constructing a scale whereon to measure the density of the strata of the atmosphere, and the heights of moun¬ tains ; that he was actually computing the areas and the lengths of innumerable curves, and was preparing for a calculus which was yet to be discovered, many of the most refined and most valuable of its resources. Of Napier, therefore, if of any man, it may safely be pro¬ nounced, that his name will never be eclipsed by any one more conspicuous, or his invention superseded by any thing more valuable",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania

"Bayer in 1619 proposed to substitute for these complex marks an accent repeated. It was our illustrious countryman Napier, however, that brought the notation of decimals to its ultimate simplicity, having proposed in his Rhabdologia, printed ten years earlier, to reject entirely the marks placed over the fractions, and merely to set a point at the end of the units. But his su¬ blime invention of Logarithms about this epoch eclipsed every minor improvement, and as far transcended the denary notation, as this had sur¬ passed the numeral system of the Greeks",Napier,NZ,8,New Zealand,Oceania

"Sir J. Lub-The chief steps have consisted in co-ordinating the bode. results of observation and analyzing them into their partial phenomena, by the help of Newton’s and Bernouilli’s theory. This labour has been greatly advanced by Dr Whewell, and also by Sir John Lub- Cotidal bock. The former has constructed maps of “ cotidal lines. lines,” which, indicating the relative time of high water in different parts of the globe, give us a gra¬ phic conception of the course and propagation of the tidal wave. The tides of the Eastern Pacific are but little known ; but a vast wave advances northwards between Australia and Africa, diverted or retarded by the obstacles it meets with in the Indian Archi¬ pelago. Another (and to us the most important) branch sets from south to north up the vast canal of the Atlantic, where it is gradually complicated by local tides, having their origin in the wide expanse between Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. The two sets of waves sometimes reinforce, sometimes oppose, one another; they are prolonged to the western shores of England and Norway, where the tidal im¬ pulse arrives 24 hours after it passed the Cape of Good Hope. It is propagated most rapidly at a dis¬ tance from coasts, and is retarded in narrows and shallows. It sends offshoots into every bay and strait, always greatly retarded in point of time (ap¬ parently by friction), but often increased in elevation by concentration of the effect in a gradually narrow¬ ing channel, as we see in the exaggerated tides of the river Amazon, the Severn, and the Bay of Fundy","Newton, Severn, Bay","US,AU,MX,NO,PH",8,"United States,Australia,Mexico,Norway,Philippines","North America,Oceania,North America,Europe,Asia"
