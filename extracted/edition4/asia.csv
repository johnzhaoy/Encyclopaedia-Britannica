"A^A (or rather Abau) Hanifah or Hanfa, fur- named Al-Nooma, was the fon of Thabet, and born at Coufah in the 80th year of the Hegira. This is the moft celebrated do&or of the orthodox Muffulmans, and his fedt is held in greateft efteem among the four which they indifferently follow. Notwithftanding this, • he was not very well efteemed during his life; infomuch that the caliph Almanfor caufed him to be imprifoned at Bagdad, for having refufed to fubfcribe to the opi¬ nion of abfolute predeftination, which the Muffulmans call Cadha. But afterwards Abou Jofeph, who was the fovereign judge or chancellor of the empire under the caliph Hadi, brought his dodlrine into fuch credit, that it became a prevailing opinion, That to be a good Muffulman was to be a Hanifite. He died in the 150th year of the Hegira, in the prifon of Bagdad : and it was not till 335 years after his death, that Melick Schah, a fultan of the Selgiucidan race, creel¬ ed to his memory a magnificent monument in the fame city, and a college for his followers, in the 485th year ol the Hegira, and Anno Chrifti 1092.

"He vouched for the truth of his revelations after his nightly vifits to heaven, and thus obtained the appella¬ tion of the faithful. He was employed in every mil¬ lion of truft or importance, was the conftant friend of the prophet, and when he was forced to fly from Mecca, was his only companion. But notwithftanding his blind devotion to Mahometanifm, his moderation and prudence were confpicuous in checking the fanatical zeal of the difciples of the new religion, on the death of Mahomet. This event threatened deftruflion to the doclrines of Iflamifm. Its followers could not doubt that it had taken place, and they were afraid to believe it. In this uncertainty and fluftuation of belief, Omar drew his fword, and threatened to cut in pieces all who dared to aftert that the prophet vras dead.

Such was his libe¬ rality to the poor and to his foldiers, that he beffowed on them the whole of his revenue. The treafury being on this account quite exhaufted at his death, made Omar fay, “ that he had left a difficult example for his fucceffors to follow.” A ffiort time before his death, he dictated his will in the following words : “ This is the will of Abubeker, which he dictated at the mo¬ ment of his departure from this world : At this moment when the infidel ffiall believe, when the impious lhall no longer doubt, and liars lhall fpeak truth, I name Omar for my fucceffor.

They lived in the plain country in huts or moveable habitations, attending their cattle, and wandering up and down as various circunlftances required.

Cambyfes had fent by the ambaffadors a rich purple robe, gold bracelets, a box of precious ointment, a veffel full of palm wine, and other things, which he imagined would be acceptable to the Ethiopian monarch. But all thefe, excepting the wine, were defpifed.

It was copied on the fpot (being the wedern entrance to A- dule, one of the cities of Ethiopia) by Cofmas Egypti- us, or, as fome call him, Cofmas Indicopleudes, in the time of the emperor Judin I. by order of Eled)aan king of the Axumites, and of which the following ac¬ count is given by the perfon who copied it. “ Here (fays he), facing the road to Axuma, dood a chair of white marble, confiding of a fquare bafe, a fmall thin column at each angle of this bafe, with a larger wreathed one in the middle, a feat or throne upon thefe, a back and two fides. Behind this chair there xvas a large done three cubits high, which had fudain- ed confiderable injury from time.

The Roman forces having about this time been drawn out of E- gypt, in order to invade Arabia, Candace queen of E- thiopia, or perhaps rather of the ifland or peninfula of Pvleroe, took the opportunity of their abfence to make an irruption, with a numerous army, into the province of Thebais. As there was at that time no force to oppofe her, fhe met for fome time with great fucccfs; but hearing at lad that Petronius, governor of Egypt, was in full march to attack her, die retired into her own dominions.

From thefe data, Mr Dunthorn compared feveral ancient and modern eclip¬ fes, with the calculations of them, by his own tables, and hereby verified Dr Halley’s opinion for he found that the fame tables reprefent the moon’s place more backward than her true place in ancient eclipfes, and more forward than her true place in later eclipfes j and thence juftly inferred, that her motion in ancient times was flower, in later times quicker, than the tables give it. But he did not content himfelf with merely afcertaining the fad! ; he proceeded to determine the quantity of the acceleratioh ; and by means of the molt ancient eclipfe of which any authentic account remains, obferved at Babylon in the year before Chrift 721, he concluded, that the obferved beginning of this eclipfe was not above an hour and three quarters before the beginning by the tables j and therefore the moon’s true place could precede her place by computation but little more than 50' of a degree at that time.

This X event « A C R [ 162 ] A C R Acre, event is rendered memorable by an aft of lingular re- V""w folution with which it was accompanied. A number of beautiful young nuns, terrified at the profpeft of being expofed to the brutal lull of the infidels, deter¬ mined to avoid the violation of their chaftity, by ren¬ dering themfelves objefts of averfion. With this view they cut off their nofes and mangled their faces. The Saracens, inflamed with refentment at a fpeftacle whicli prevented the gratification of their appetites, imme¬ diately put them all to the fword. After the expulfion of the crufaders, it remained almoft deferted till about the year 1750, when it was fortified by Daher, an Arabian fcheik who maintained his independence again!! the Ottoman power, till the year 1775, when he %vas bafely affaffmated by the emiffaries of that go- \^ernment at the age of 86 years.

"The Saxon princes and great men, who, in the divi- fion of the lands, had received the greateft ftiares, are faid to have fubdivided their eftates into two parts, wdiich were called the in-lands and the out-lands. The in¬ lands were thofe which lay moft contiguous to the manfion-houfe of their owner, which he kept in his own pofleflion, and cultivated by his Haves, under the direction of a bailiff, for the purpofe of raifing provi- fions for the family. The out-lands were thofe at a greater diftance from the houfe, and were let to the ceorls, or farmers of thofe times, at very moderate rents. By the law7s of Ina king of the Weft Saxons, wTo reigned in the end of the feventh and beginning of the eighth century, a farm confining of ten hides, or plough-lands, was to pay the following rent: “ Ten calks of honey 5 three hundred loaves of bread j twelve calks of ftrong ale ; thirty calks of fmall ale *, tw7o oxen •, ten wsdders ; ten geefe *, twenty hens ; ten cheefes; one calk of butter-, fivefalmonj twenty pounds of forage 5 and one hundred eels.” From this low rent, the imperfeCtion of agriculture at that time is eafily difcoverable ; but it is ftill more io from the low prices at which land was then fold.

It is faid that a fpot of ground, oc¬ cupied by fome kinds of trees fuch as chefnuts or dates, is capable of producing a very great portion of food, ufeful for the fupport of the human fpeciesi One ad¬ vantage attending the Cultivation of fuch vegetables, would be that, after the trees are planted, and fecured by fences for a few years againft animals, they would for ever after, or at lead; for many years, continue to grow and fiourifh without care or labour. It does not appear, however, that in any nation of ancient or modern times, forefts of fruit-bearing trees have been reared with a view to afford fubfiftence to the community. For this two reafons may be afligned. In the firft place, a coii- fiderable number of years muft elapfe, before fuch plants could arrive at maturity, and fulfil the putpofe of their deftination. Of whatever ufe therefore they might be to future ages, it is evident that they could afford little benefit to the generation which planted them. But in u queftion about fubfiftence, mankind are ufually under the neceftity of confidering their own immediate wants, and hence they have been led to the cultivation of fuch plants, as afford the moft fpeedy reward for the efforts of their induftry. Another reafon for preferring the cul¬ ture of fmall annual plants, to the greater and more per¬ manent productions of nature, would arife, in the early ages of the world, from the turbulent ftate of fociety and the frequency of wars. A community that fhould depend for its fubfiftence upon the fruit of foreft trees, might be ruined for half a century by the inroad of an enemy. An example of this was exhibited in the war between Great Britain, and her North American colo¬ nies. When the parent ftate hired the favages on the weftern frontier, to join her party and to make inroads upon the colonifts, the latter retaliated upon the favages in the following manner. Several of the colonies united 3 L T U R E. Theory in fending an expedition againft the Indians.

They were not fatisfied however with deftroying the huts of the natives, and thefe incipi¬ ent efforts of favage induftry ; but they anxioufiy fought out and deftroyed every fruit-bearing tree that they found in their progrefs of almoft a thoufand miles, there¬ by rendering the wildernefs utterly uninhabitable to a people deftitute of agriculture, and who could not always depend for fubfiftence upon their fuccefs in hunt¬ ing. From this example we fee that the frequent wars arifing from the barbarous charafter of ancient nations, would compel them to feek fubfiftence, not from the fruit of foreft trees, but from grain which fpeedily ar¬ rives at maturity, and which when deftroyed can foon be renewed.

"That plants growing in fertile mould, like that now mentioned, derive nourifnment or food horn it, cannot, be doubted, ftnee we fee, that when taken out of it, or placed in another but lefs favourable foil, they fpeedi- •y go into decay. What the particular fubftances are, however, which they take from it, has not been dhoo¬ ve red. But it appears from the minutenefs of the ex treme fibres of the roots of plants, that the food taken in by them muft be foluble in water, or in a liquid Bate when taken in by them. Accordingly, their food is aflually found to afeend through their organs in a liquid form. Of this liquor or fap there are two kinds, the afeending and the defeending. The afeending lap is that which rifes in the fpring j and by cutting a fhort way through the bark into the wood of many trees, large quantities of it may be drawn off, without injury to their health or growth. This fap afeends to the leaves, and there undergoes fome change by the aclion of the air 5 for the leaves of vegetables appear to perform to them an office fimilar to that which is accompliftied in animals by the organ called the lungs. From the leaves the fap, thus changed, defeends to every part of the plant, and contributes to its growth by becoming a part of its fubftance. It would feem, however, that the liquors which circulate in plants, not only undergo a change at the leaves, but alfo at their firft entrance by the velfels of the roots j for if feveral different kinds of trees are ingrafted upon the fame common ilock, each of them is able to de¬ rive the fap peculiar to itfelf from the fap of the com¬ mon flock. Thus alfo the chemifts have informed us, that vinegar, called by them the acetous acid, is found varioufiy combined in the afeending fap of various trees 5 but it has never yet been difeovered, that vine¬ gar exifts in any perceptible quantity in vegetable mould. That fubftance, therefore, muft be formed by the root, by bringing together the ingredients of that acid which it finds and ielecfs in the earth. , When any plant, whether great or fmall, is put in¬ to a clofe veffel, and ftrongly heated, allowing only the fmoke to efcape, the refidue is in all cafes of the fame nature, and is called charcoal, or by the chemifts carbon. Of this carbonaceous matter a confiderable quantity is always found in rich garden mould, derived no doubt from the remains of vegetable fubftances of which that mould was originally formed. This car¬ bonaceous matter, however, or charcoal, being info- luble in water, cannot in its ordinary itate enter into the veffels of growing vegetables ; but, as it is render¬ ed foluble by a variety of combinations, it is no doubt found out in fuch a ftate by the fibres of growing roots, and conveyed upwards in the juice. But as all vege¬ table mould, and the charcoal or carbonaceous matter which it contains, is the refult of the ruins of vegeta¬ tion, and as the lichens or vegetables of the coarfeft and fimpleft kind, which originally grow upon the na¬ ked ftone, have no other nouriftiment than water and atmofpheric air, it is probable, that out of thefe mate¬ rials they are capable of forming the charcoal, which conftitutes the bafts of their form, and of the conftitu- tion of every other vegetable.

The feveral fpouts all reft upon a bar, which hangs and plays freely by two diagonal fupport- ers BB; a trigger fixed to this bar bears a catch-wheel j this being fixed on the axle, occafions a regular and continual motion, or jogging of the fpouts, quicker or flower in proportion to the pace the perfon fowing with it drives } and of courfe, if he quickens his pace, the bar will receive a greater number of ftrokes from the catch-wheel, and- the grain or feed will feed the rafter. If he drives {lower, by receiving fewer ftrokes, the contrary muft take place. In going along the fide of a hill, the ftrength of the ftroke is corrected by a fpring which acts with more or leis power, in pro¬ portion as the machine is more or lefs from a horizon¬ tal pofition, and counteracts the difference of gravity in the ban, fo that it preffes, in all fituations, with a pro¬ per force againft the catch-wheel. This fpring is un- neceffary if the land be pretty level. At the bottom of the machine is placed an apron or fiielf in a Hoping pofition; and the corn or feed, by falling thereon from the fpouts above, is fcattered about in every direction under the machine, and covers the ground in a moft regular and uniform manner",Of,TR,4,Turkey,Asia

"“ I take notice of this circumftance, fays he, in fome meafure to prevent the 'prejudice that fome inattentive obfervers might entertain againft W’hat was faid before of Preparation this method of draining, from their having accidentally 01 feen fome fields that may have been bettered by it. —y——' “ Togs are only a variety of this laft-mentioned kind of wet ground ; and, therefore, ought in general to be drained after the fame manner with them. Clay is a fubftance that ftrongly refifts the entrance of winter into it: but when it is long drenched with it, it is, in procefs of time, in fome meafure diffolved thereby j lofes its original firmnefs of texture and confiftence; and becomes a fort of femi-fluid mafs, which is called a bog; and as thefe are fometimes covered with a ftrong fcurf of a particular kind of grafs, with very matted roots, which is ftrong enough to bear a fmall weight without breaking, although it yields very much, it is in thefe circumitances called a./waggle. But, what¬ ever be the nature of the bog, it is invariably occa- fioned by water being forced up through a bed of clay, as juft nowr defcribed, and diffolving or foftening, if you will, a part thereof. I fay only a part; becaufe whatever may be thy depth of the bog or fwaggle, it generally has a partition of folid clay between it and the refervoir of water under it, from whence it original¬ ly proceeds : for if this were not the cafe, and the quantity of water wrere confiderable, it would meet with no fufticient refiftance from the bog, and would iffue through it with violence, and carry the whole femi- fluid mafs along with it. But this would more ine¬ vitably be the cafe, if there was a cruft at the bottom of the bog, and if the cruft ihould ever be broken, efpecially if the quantity of w^ater under it were very confiderable : and as it is probable, that, in many cafes of this fort, the water fiowly diflblves more and more of this under cruft, I make no doubt but that, in the revolution of many ages, a great many eruptions of this kind may have happened, although they may not have been deemed of importance enough to have the hiftory of them tranfmitted to pofterity. Of this kind, although formed of a different fubftance, I confider the flow of the Solway mofs in Northumberland to have been ; which, upon the 16th of November 1771, burft its former boundaries, and poured forth a prodigious ftream of femi-fluid matter, which in a fhort time co¬ vered feveral hundred acres of very fine arable ground",Of,TR,4,Turkey,Asia

"20 r The firft thing that occurs on this head, is to con-Of ridgea, fider what grounds ought to be formed into ridges, and what ought to be tilled with a flat furface. Dry foils, which fuffer by lack of moiflure, ought to be tilled fiat, which tends to retain moifture. And the method for fuch tilling, is to go round and round from the cir¬ cumference to the centre, or from the centre to the circumference. This method is advantageous in point of expedition, as the whole is finifhed without once turning the plough. At the fame time, every inch of the foil is moved, inftead of leaving either the crown or the furrow unmoved, as is commonly done in tilling ridges. Clay foil, which fuffers by water Handing on it, ought to be laid as dry as poflille by proper ridges",Of,TR,4,Turkey,Asia

"“ All my experiments have been made without mucking, or any manure, for the turnip and wheat crop j and on thole parts where I have fed off at the time it has been dry weather, though with all forts of ftock mixed, and drawing as above, I have growm at the rate of five coomb of wheat per acre, and at the rate of eight coomb of rye per acre ; and fome was al- moft totally deftroyed by feeding off in wet weather, as I w’as determined not to defift, that I might know the bad or good effefts from feeding off the turnips with the corn in different weather, as well as the dif¬ ferent months; all which I fhall be able to give infor¬ mation of next year, to thofe who wifli to known I find the feed nearly wmrth the coft of the feed corn, which is a material confideration in cafe you plough the land for barley or other fummer corn ; but if the wheat or rye Hands a crop to your mind, it will do better to harrow it in the fpring, at which time you may fow your grafs feeds, which I find anfwer very Vvell; or plough the ftubble early in the autumn, and fow with clover or other feeds.-” The well-knowm author of the Annals of Agricul¬ ture has given a farther accoimt of this method of cul¬ tivation. The idea which led to Mr Walker’s experi¬ ments was this : Wheat requires a certain degree of ftiffnefs and compaftnefs in the foil upon which it is reared. Of this compatftnefs, fandy foils are apt to be deficient in proportion to the degree of tillage they re¬ ceive. Hence it occurred to Mr Walker, that if wheat could be' fown without any ploughing at all, there would be a better chance of a crop upon certain foils, than after the moft expenfive fyftem of tillage",Of,TR,4,Turkey,Asia
"Peafe laid a foot below the furface will vegetate; but the moft approved depth is fix inches in light foil, and four inches in clay foil 5 for which reafon, they ought to be fown under furrow when the ploughing is de¬ layed till fpring.

"Previous to the year 1770, beans were feldom fown in Scotland, unlefs upon the very rich clays j but fmce that time, by adopting the plan of raifing them in drills, or diftinfi; rows, they have been fuccefsfully cul¬ tivated upon all the heavy loams, and in many farms they now conftitute a regular branch of rotation. With very few exceptions, beans are conftantly drilled at in¬ tervals of from 20 to 27 inches. Of thefe modes, the laft is the moft prevalent, becaufe it admits the ground to be ploughed with a horfe, in the moft fufficient man¬ ner. Very little hand-hoing is given *, nor is it required, as the kind of land which is beft adapted for their growth, and upon which they are commonly fown, has not naturally a tendency to the produflion of an¬ nual weeds, and fine crops of wheat-generally follow, provided due attention has been given to working the bean crop.
