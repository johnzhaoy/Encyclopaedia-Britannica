"ABELARD, Peter, an eminent fcholaftic philo- fopher of France, the fon of Berenger, of noble def- cent, was born at Palais near Nantes in Bretagne, in the year 1079. Abelard had received from nature a vigorous and a£five mind; but it was his lot to live at a period, when logic, metaphyfics, and polemic theo- C 2 logy7 ABE [ i‘ logy conflituted a learned education, when abitrufe fpeculations and verbal fubtleties occupied the ingenu¬ ity of literary men, and diftinguiihed talents for depu¬ tation led to honour and preferment. Devoted to let¬ ters by his father’s appointment, and by his own incli¬ nation, his literary attainments could at this time only be exhibited in the field of fcholaftic philofophy ; and, that he might be fitted for his deftined career of life, he was placed, after a previous courfe of grammatical Itudies, under the tuition of Rofceline, a celeorated metaphyfieian, and founder of the fe£t of the Nomi- nahfts. Under the inftru£fions of this able mailer, at the early age of fixteen, he furnilhed himfell with a large ftore of fcholaftic knowdedge, and acquired a fubtlety and quicknefs of thought, a fluency of fpeech, and facility of expreflion, wdiichwere neceliary qualifi¬ cations in fcholaftic deputation",Nantes,FR,4,France,Europe
"Elated by fuccefs, and confident of his own powers, Abelard, without hefitation, at the age of twenty-two, opened a public fchool of his own. “ I was young in¬ deed,” fays he, “ but confident of myfelf, my ambi¬ tion had no bounds : I afpired to the dignity of a pro- fefibr, and only waited till I could fix on a proper place to open my ledftures.” Melun, a town ten leagues from Paris, where the court frequently refided, wras the place which die chofe for this bold difplay of his talents.

Abelard at length prevailed, his fchool wras opened, and his leisures wrere attended by crowded and admiring auditories. Em¬ boldened by this fuccefs, and perhaps ftimulated by unworthy refentment, Abelard refolved to maintain an open conteft with his mafter, and for this purpofe re¬ moved his fchool to Corbeil near Paris.

A triumph fo complete, while it gratified the vanity of Abelard, could not fail to provoke the refentment of his old mafter, who had influence to obtain the appointment of a new profeflbr, and drive Abelard back to Melun.

He therefore quitted his fchool at St Genevieve, and removed to Laon, to be¬ come a fcholar of Anfelm. From, this celebrated ma¬ fter he entertained high expectations} but they were foon difappointed. On attending his leCtures be found, that, though he pofleffed uncommon fluency of lan-' guage, he left bis auditors without inftruCtion. “ You would have thought,” fays Abelard, “ he w^as kindling a fire, when inftantly the whole houfe w'as filled with fmoke, in which not a Angle fpark was yifible : he was a tree covered with a thick foliage, which pleafed the diftant eye ; but, on a nearer infpeCtion, .there was no fruit to be found : I went up to this tree in full expectation, but I faw that it was the fig-tree v hich tus Lord had curfed.” (Rift.

The vivacity of his difpofition, and the fprightlinefs of his manners, led him to prefer the gayer amufements of life, and the fociety of men of fafhion and pleafure, to the arduous profecution of phi- lofophical ftudies, and to the lefs inviting and more barren paths of legal diiqtiifitions. When, however, either during his academical courfe, or the fir ft years of his practice at the bar, occafions required the exer¬ tion of his talents, the quicknefs of his perception, and the acutenefs and ftrength of his underftanding, enabled him to difplay fuch powers of attention and applica¬ tion to bufinefs as are feldom acquired but by regular and uniform habits of induftry, and by the force of conftant application. But, to attain that diftinction and eminence to which he afpired, and to fecure that independence which the patrimony of a younger fon of a family, more refpeftable than opulent, could not afford him, he found it necefiary to withdraw from thofe fcenes of amufement and pleafure, and to feclude himfelf from that fociety which his gaiety and agree¬ able manners had enlivened and entertained, and to think ferioufly of applying to the labours of his profef- fion.

About this time, he was engaged as counfel in a caufe in which jrablic curiofity and opinion were much interefted and •divided. This caufe, which was of a very intricate nature, afforded an opportunity of making a more emi¬ nent difplay of his profeffional talents. By a fpeech which he delivered on this occafion, confpicuous for accurate difcrimination, ftrength of argument, and im- preffive eloquence, he gave a favourable prefage of his future celebrity.

The Roman forces having about this time been drawn out of E- gypt, in order to invade Arabia, Candace queen of E- thiopia, or perhaps rather of the ifland or peninfula of Pvleroe, took the opportunity of their abfence to make an irruption, with a numerous army, into the province of Thebais. As there was at that time no force to oppofe her, fhe met for fome time with great fucccfs; but hearing at lad that Petronius, governor of Egypt, was in full march to attack her, die retired into her own dominions.

Their prefent journey indeed was much more perilous than- their voyage from Por¬ tugal to Abyflinia. The emperor was at this time in the fouthern part of his dominions, but the Portuguefe had landed on the northern part j fo that they had al- moft the whole breadth of the empire to pafs before they could meet wqth him. The very firft journey they attempted was through a wood fo thick that it could fcarce afford a paffage either to man or beaft, wdiile the interftices of the trees were fo interwoven with briers and thorns of various kinds, that their paf¬ fage was rendered almoft imprafticable.

Gragne, thus left to decide the quarrel with his Africans, was quick¬ ly defeated by Claudius 5 and in another engagement which took place on the 10th of February 1543, his troops -were defeated and himfelf killed. This lafl misfortune was owing to his boldnefs in advancing be¬ fore his army which was giving wray, fo that he be¬ came known to the Portuguefe. On this he wTas ■fingled out by a Portuguefe named Peter Lyon, •who had been valet de chambre to Don Chriftopher.

To this the patriarch replied, that being fub- jefts of the king of Portugal, they were under no ob¬ ligation to obey a traitor to his king and religion 5 and that fince his majelly ftill perfifted in refiifing to fub- mit to the pope, he was refolved to leave the empire with his forces..

The attempt was accordingly made, but with very little fuccefs 5 the Portuguefe having ftrewed the ground with gunpowder, fet fire to it as the Abyffmians marched along, which deftroyed great numbers, and intimida¬ ted the reft to fuch a degree that they inftantly fled",,PT,4,Portugal,Europe

Befides this, Ifaac ftrengthened himfelf alfo by an alliance with the Portuguefe 3 which, had their numbers been at all confiderable, muft have been very formidable. Their inclination to defert their form¬ er protedlor and ally the emperor, proceeded entirely from the (hameful behaviour of their priefts, who never wrould be fatisfied without enflaving the emperor as well as his fubjedts to the tyranny of Rome.

On his introdudlion to the emperor Claudius, he informed him, that the pope and king of Portugal now expedled no lefs than an imme¬ diate fulfilment of his engagements of fubmiflion to the fee of Rome. This requifition was made with fuch an air of infolence, that the prince could fcarce conceal his refentment 3 but reftraining his paffion, he promifed to confider of it, and to call meetings of the learned in thefe matters to debate the point.

About the end of the 17th century, a number of Francifcans from Italy fettled at Cairo in Egypt, and were maintained at the expence of the fathers in Paleftine, though pre¬ tending to be independent of their fuperior the guar¬ dian of Jerufalem. The latter, difpleafed at this me¬ thod of proceeding, offered to fupply the miflion to Egypt entirely at the expence of Paleftine, and like- wife to furnifh from thence miflionaries capable of in- ftru&ing the people in the Chriftian religion. This propofal meeting with a favourable reception at Rome, .a new fet of miflionaries from Jerufalem, called by our author Capuchins, appeared at Cairo j from whence the Francifcans were banifhed, only two of them being allowed to remain in that city. The others returned to Rome j where, finding that they could not re-efta- blifli themfelves by fair means, they had recourfe to artifice and fidlion. It was now pretended, that, on the expulfion of the Jefuits from Abyflinia, a great number of Catholic Chriftians had fled into the neigh¬ bouring countries of Nubia and Sennaar, where they found themfelves fo grievoufly oppreffed by the Ma¬ hometans, that, without fome fpiritual afliftance, they would be under the neceflity of renouncing their re¬ ligion. This ftory being confirmed by the two Fran¬ cifcans who remained at Cairo, the caufe of thefe fup- pofed Chriftians was eagerly efpoufed by the religious in Italy, and a new miffion fet on foot at the expence of the pope for their relief, which continues to this day under the title of the Ethiopic Miffion.

"As to the Greek accents, now feen both in manu- feripts and printed books, there has been no lefs dif- pute about their antiquity and ufe than about thole of the Hebrews. Ifaac Voffius endeavours to prove them of modem invention; afferting, that antiently they had nothing of this kind, bat only a few notes in their poetry, which were invented by Ariftophanes the gram¬ marian, about the time of Ptolemy Philopater •, and that thefe were of mufical, rather than grammatical ufe, ferving as aids in the finging of their poems, and very different from thofe introduced afterwards. He alfo fhows from feveral ancient grammarians, that the man¬ ner of writing the (jreek accents in thefe days was quite different from that which appears in our books. The author of La Mcthode Greque, p. 546, obferves, that the right pronunciation of the Greek language being natu¬ ral to the Greeks, it was needlefs for them to mark it by accents in their writings : fo that, according to all ap¬ pearance, they only began to make ufe of them about the time when the Romans, wiihing to learn the Greek tongue, fent their children to ftudy at Athens, thinking thereby to fix the pronunciation, and to facilitate it to ftrangers; which happened, as the fame author obferves, a little before Cicero’s time. Wetftein, Greek profeffor at Bafil, in a learned differtation, en¬ deavours to prove the Greek accents of an older Hand¬ ing. He owns that they wrere not always formed in the fame manner by the ancients ; but thinks that difference owing to the different pronunciation which obtained in the different parts of Greece. He bringsieveral reafons, a priori, ""for the ufe of accents, even in the earlieli days: as that they then wrote all in capital letters equi- diftant from each other, without any diftinclion either of words or phrafes, wdiich without accents could fcarce be intelligible ; and that accents were neceffary to diftin- guilh ambiguous w’ords, and to point out their proper meaning : wdiich he confirms from a difpute on a paf- fage in Homer, mentioned by Ariftotle in his Poetics, chap. v.

They always read poetry as well as profe by accent.

"ACC r 122 ] ACC Accent, mflances which occurred in proof of this affertion more particularly. Of the two firft perfons whom I met, one, the fteward of the fliip, an inhabitant of the ifland of Cephalonia, had had a fchool education : he read Euripides and tranflated fome eafier paffages without much difficulty. By a flay in this country of near two years he was able to fpeak Englifh very tolerably, as could the captain and feveral of the crew} and almoft all of them fpoke Italian fluently. The companion however of the fteward could fpeak only modern Greek, in which I could difcover that he was giving a defcrip- ticn of the diftrefs in which the flrip had been, and though not able to underhand the context I could plain¬ ly diftinguifli many words, fuch as oivdgrt—and a- mongft the reft the found of AvUgaTrog pronounced fliort 5 this awoke my curioftty, which was ftill more heighten¬ ed when I obferved that he faid Avfarav long, with the feme attention to the alteration of the accent with the variety of cafe, which a boy would be taught to pay at a fchool in England. Watching therefore more clofely, and alking the other to read fome ancient Greek, I found that they both uniformly pronounced according to accent, without any attention to long or ftiort fyllables where accent came in the way; and on their departure, one of them having bade me good day, by faying Y.ctMy^st, to which I anfwered KcsAk^s^, he with ftrong marks of reprobation fet me right, and repeated 5 and with like cenfure did the cap¬ tain upon another occafion obferve upon my faying So¬ crates inftead of Socrates",Of,"GR,TR,IT",4,"Greece,Turkey,Italy","Europe,Asia,Europe"
"“ I now had a ftrong wifti to know whether they obferved the diftindlion in this refpecl ufually between verfe and profe, but from the little fcholarftiip of the two men with whom I had converfed, from the igno¬ rance of a third whom I afterwards met, (who however read Lucian with eafe, though he did not feem ever to have heard of the book), and on account of my im- perfeft mode of converfing with them all, I had little hopes of fatisfaclion on the point, nor was I clear that they perfectly knew the difference between verfe and profe. At length having met with the commander of the Anip, and his clerk Athanaflus Kovouo?, and finding that the latter had been a fchoolmafter in the Morea, and had here learnt to fpeak Englifh fluently, I put the queftion to them in the prefence of a very learned college friend, and at another time, to avoid any error, with the aid of a gentleman who is perfeftly mafter of the Italian language. Both the Greeks repeatedly af- - fared us that verfe as well as profe was read by accent, and not by quantity, and exemplified it by reading fe¬ veral lines of Homer, with whofe name they feemed perfectly well acquainted",,IT,4,Italy,Europe
"on the firft fyllable, and feid it thence neceffarily fol-   v  lowed; for it is impoffible to pronounce the firft fyllable with the great length which the circumflex denotes and not to ftiorten the fecond. The teftimony of the fchool¬ mafter might be vitiated, but what could be ftronger, than that of thefe ignorant mariners as to the vulgar common praflice of modern Greece 5 and it is remark¬ able that this confirms the opinion of Bilhop Horiley, that the tones of words in connexion are not always the feme with the tones of folitary words, though in thofe of more than one fyllable the accentual marks do not change their pofition. I muft here add that thefe men confirmed an obfervation which I have heard made, that we are much miftaken in our idea of the fuppofed lofty found of mXvfXoicrQoio Scthctrc-vig; that the borderers on the coaft of the Archipelago take their ideas from the gentle laving of the ftrore by a fummer wave, and not from the roaring of a winter ocean, and they accordingly pronounced it Folyphlifvea thalqffes",,GR,4,Greece,Europe
"“ I own that the obfervations made by me on the pro¬ nunciation of thefe modem Greeks brought a perfectly new train of ideas into my mind. I propofe them, with humility, for the confideration of the learned; but they have made a ftrong impreffion upon me, and ap¬ proached, when compared with other admitted fafls, nearly to conviction. In ftiort, I am ftrongly inclined to believe, that what the famous treatife fo often men¬ tioned on the profodies of the Greek and Latin lan¬ guages mentions as the peculiarity of the Englifti, that we always prolong the found of the fyllable on which the acute accent falls, is true, and has been true of every nation upon earth. We know it is true of the modern Italians—they read Latin in that refpedl juft as we do, and fay, Arma virumque cano, and, In nova fert animus, as much as we. And when we find the modern Greeks following the feme pradlice, furely w e have fome caufe to fuppofe that the ancients did the feme. In the Englifti language, indeed, quantity is not affefled, becaufe accent and quantity always agree",,GR,4,Greece,Europe
"Bifliop Horfley endeavoured to prove that they did fo in Greek, but this is on the bold fuppofition that the accent doth not fall wdiere the mark is placed. The objeftion to this hypothefis, which feems to have been admitted by all Writers, and confidered as decifive by fome as to profe, by all as to verfe, is that fuch a mode of pronunciation or reading muft deftroy metre, or rhythmos. From this pofition, however univerfel, or however it may have been taken for granted, I totally diffent. That it will oppofe the metre or quantity 1 readily agree, but that it will deftroy the rhythmos, by which, whatever learned deferiptions there may have been of its meaning, I underftand nothing more than the melody or fmooth flowing of the verfes, or their harmony if you pleafe, if harmony be properly applied to fuc- cefllve and not lynchronal founds. On the contrary, nothing can be moiie difegreeable or unmelodious than the reading verfe by quantity, or fcanning of it, as it is- vulgarly called. Let us try the line fo often quoted-— Arma virumque cano, Frojce qm primus ab oris, inftead of Arma virUnique cant. Frija qu: primus ah oris, “ No Accent",,GR,4,Greece,Europe
"Secondly, Metre determines the number of feet or mea- fures in each verfe, and thereby produces a general a- nalogy and harmony through the whole \ and it is to be obferved, that, as I apprehend, accent doth not change the number of feet, though it doth the na¬ ture or fpecies of them. Thus when we read Anna virumque ca.no, Trojce qni primus ab oris, we do not make more feet than when we fcan the line, nor employ more time than in pronouncing the next line in which the accent happens to accord with the quantity, viz",Anna,RU,4,Russian Federation,Europe

"However he began to inquire, whether feveral parti¬ culars mentioned about the other life were agreeable' to reafon; and, upon inquiry and deliberation, he imagined that reafon fuggefted many arguments agaimt them. Acofta was about two and twenty, when he was thus perplexed with doubts 5 and the retult of ns reflections was, that he could not be faved by the reli¬ gion which he had imbibed in his infancy. Neverthe- lefs he profecuted his ftudies in the law ; and at the age of five and twenty, was made treafurer in a colle¬ giate church. Being naturally of a religious dilpoh- tion, and now' made uneafy by the popifti doClrmes, he began to ftudy Mofes and the prophets ; where he thought he found more fatisfaCtion than in the goipel, and at length became convinced that Judaifm was the true religion : and, as he could not profefs it m Portu¬ gal he refolved to leave the country. He accordingly refumed his place, and embarked for Amfterdam with' his mother and brothers; whom he had ventured to in-- ftruft in the principles of the Jewifti religion, even when in Portugal. Soon after their arrival in Amfter¬ dam, they became members of the fynagogue $ v.-ere circumcifed according to cuftom *, and he changed his name of Gabriel for that of Uriel. A little time was fufficient to ffiew him, that the Jews did neither in their rites nor morals conform to the law ol Moles, 01 which he could not but declare his difapprobation : but the chiefs of the fynagogue gave him to underhand, that he muff exatfly obferve their tenets and cuitoms •, and that he would be-excommunicated, if he deviated in the leaft from them. This threat, however, had no effedt ; for he thought it would be a moft mean beha¬ viour in him, who had left the fweets of his native country purely for liberty of confctence, to iubmit to a fet of Rabbis without any proper junfdiction *, and that it wmuld ftiew both want of courage and piety, it he ffiould ftifle his fentiments on this occafion. He there¬ fore perfifted in his invedtives, andtin confequence was excommunicated : the effedt of which was fuch, that his own brothers durft not fpeak to hinqnor uilide him when they met him in the ftreets. Finding himfeit thus fituated, he wrote a book m his juitihcation , wherein he endeavours to ftiew, that the rites and tra- Acofta- AGO [ r ^couftrs c^t'l0us l^ie P^ari^es are contrary to tlie writings of cks.. Mofes, and foon after adopted the opinion of the Sad- ducees : for he had worked himfelf up to a belief, that the rewards and puniihments of the old law' relate only to this life j and this, becaufe Mofes nowhere men¬ tions tlie joys of heaven, or the torments of hell. His adverfaries were overjoyed at his embracing this tenet; forefeeing, that it would tend greatly to juftify, in the fight of Chriftians, the proceedings of the fynagogues againft him. Before his book was printed, there ap¬ peared a piece upon the immortality of the foul, writ¬ ten by a phyfician, who omitted nothing he could fug¬ ged: to make Acofta pafs for an Atheift.

I am in a country where I am a ftranger, and unacquainted with the language ? Had I not better play the ape amongft apes ?” He accordingly return¬ ed to the Jewifti church, after he had been excommu¬ nicated 15 years 5 and, after having made a recanta¬ tion ©f what he had -written, fubferibed every thing as they dire&ed. A few days after, he was accufed by ■a nephew, who lived in his houfe, that he did not, as to his eating and many other points, conform to the ‘aws of the fynagogue. This accufation was attended ■with very bad contequences ; for a relation of Acofta, W'ho had got him reconciled to the fynagogue, thought lie was in honour bound to perfecute him with the ut- tn.oft violence.

"It is Hill more important in another view : it has en¬ couraged us to make fimilar attempts in other cafes, and has fupplied us with a fad! to which an ingenious mind can eafily fancy fomething analogous in many ab- flrufe operations of nature, and thus it enables us- to give fome fort of explanation of them.

The ccnfe- quences of this procedure have been no lefs fatal to the progrefs of true knowdedge in modem times than in the fchools of ancient Greece j and the ethereal philofophers cf this age, like the followers of Ariftotle of old, have filled ponderous volumes with nonfenfe s t 1 c s. 143 and error.

But this procedure of nature cannot be feen with diftindfnefs and precifion by any but well-informed mathematicians. They alone can reft with unftiaken confidence on the conclufions legitimately deduced from the Newtonian theorems } and even they can infure fucceis only by treading with the moft fcrupulous caution the fteps of this patient philofopher. But few have done this \ and wTe may venture to fay, that not one in ten cf thofe ivlio em¬ ploy the Newtonian dodtrines of elaftic undulations ror the explanation of other phenomena have taken the trouble, or indeed were able, to go through the fteps of the fundamental propofition (Prin. II. 50, &c.) But the general refults are lo plain, and admit of fuch nn- preflive illuftration, that they draw the affent of the moft carelefs reader ; and all imagine that they under- ftand the explanation, and perceive the whole proce¬ dure of nature. Emboldened therefore by this fuc¬ cefsful ftep in philofophy, they, without heiitation, fancy fimilar intermediums in other cafes \ and as air has been found to be a vehicle for found, they have fuppofed that fomething which they call ether, fome- how refembling air, is the vehicle of viiion. Others have proceeded farther, and have held that ether, or another fomething like air, is the vehicle of fenfaticn in general, from the organ to the brain : nay, we have got a great volume called A Theory of Man, where all our fenfations, emotions, affedhons, thoughts, and purpofes or volitions, are faid to be fo many vibrations of another fomething equally unfeen, gratuitous, and incompetent •, and, to crown all, this exalted dodlrine, w7hen logically profecuted, muft terminate in the dif- covery of thofe vibrations which pervade all others, and which conftitute wdiat we have been accuftomed to venerate by the name Deity.

This is not a needlefs and declamatory rbapfody. If the explanation of found can be legitimately transferred to thofe other claftes of phenomena, thefe are certain refults 5 and if fo, all the difeoveries made by New ton are but the glimmerings cf the morning, when compar-- ed with this meridian fplendour.

Not a veftige of any of the private buildings of the wealthy citizens, which have been described and celebrated by their writers for their magnificence, now remains } and even the fituation of fome of the fplend./! villas of the luxurious Romans is fcarcely known. In tracing the progrefs of architecture and the otner fine arts among the Romans, Mr Adam oblerveu that they hgd vifibly declined previous to the time of Diociefian; but he was alfo convinced that the liberal patronage and munificence of that emperor had revived during his reign a better tafte for architecture, and had form¬ ed artifts who were capable of imitating the more ele¬ gant itile of a purer age. He had feen this remark¬ ably exemplified in the public baths at Rome, which were ereCted by him, the molt entire and the noblelt of the ancient buildings. Admiring the extent and fertility of genius of the artifts, from whofe defigns fuch magnificent ftruCtures had been executed, he was anxious to fee and ftudy any remains that yet exifted of thofe mafters whofe works are ftriking monuments of an elegant and improved tafte, but whofe names, amid the wrecks of time, have funk into oblivion. It was with this viewr that he undertook a voyage to Spa- latro, in Dalmatia, to vifit and examine the private pa¬ lace of Dioclefian, in which that emperor refided for nine years previous to his death, and to which he re¬ tired in the year 305, when he refigned the government of the empire. Mr Adam failed from Venice in July 1754, accompanied by M. CleriiTeau, a French artift and antiquarian, and two experienced draughtfmen. On their arrival at Spalatro, they found that though the pa¬ lace had buffered much from the injuries of time, yet it had fuftained not lefs from the dilapidations of the inha¬ bitants to procure materials for building, and even the foundations of the ancient ftrufture were covered with modern houfes. With high expectations of fuccefs, they commenced their labours, but were boon inter¬ rupted by the jealous vigilance of the government","Rome, Venice","US,FR",4,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"Mr Adam now returned to England, and foon rofe to very confiderable profefiional eminence. In 1762 he was appointed architect to the king, and the year following he prefented to the pnolic the fruit of his voyage to Spalatro, in a ipendid work dedicated to his majefty, which contains engravings and defcriptions of the ruins of the palace. A later traveller, the Abbe Fortis, fpeaking of the ruins of this palace, fays, “ I will not pretend to mention the great Roman remains, for which this noble city is chiefiy known and cele¬ brated. The lovers of architecture and antiquity are lufficiently acquainted with them by the work of Mr ges by his elegant drawings and engravings.

For all this, I do not mean to detraCt from the merit of the auguft remains of Dioclefian’s palace",Roman,RO,4,Romania,Europe
"I count them among the molt refpeCtable monuments of antiquity now extant.” And the hiltorian of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, in confequence of this obfervation, after having expreffed a high com¬ mendation of the w'ork, has thrown out a fufpicion O', the accuracy of the reprelentations and defcriptions.- “ Forthe account ofDioclefian’s palace,fays Mr Gibbon, we are indebted to an ingenious artifi: of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiofity had carried into the heart of Dalmatia. But there is room to fui- pect that the elegance of his defigns and engravings has fomewhat fiattered the obje&s which it was their purpofe to reprefent. We are informed by a more re¬ cent and very judicious traveller, that the awful ruins of Spalatro are not lefs expreflive of the decline of the arts, than of the greatnefs of the Roman empire in the time of Dioclefian.” Mr Gibbon’s criticifm is fcarcely fupported by the obfervation of the Abbe Fortis ; and what the latter has advanced on this fubjeft is not per¬ fectly confiftent with itfelf : for while he cenfures the coarfenefs of the work and the bad tafte of the age, ne beftows fomething like indireCt pvaife, when he adds that, he means not to detraCl from the merit of the auguft remains of this edifice, and regards it as one of the molt refpeCtable monuments of antiquity now ex¬ tant. The apparent coarfenefs of the work is probably owing to the effeCts of the weather, which have .de- ftroyed the fmooth polifti of the chiflel which it origi¬ nally received } and Mr Adam allows, that, previous to this period of the Roman empire, the arts had vifi¬ bly declined, but at the fame time contends, that the buildings ereCted in the reign of Dioclefian, exhibit convincing proofs of the ftile and manner of a purer age.

The pontiff readily acquiefced in her propofal for calling a council, and commiffioned two legates to attend it. The firft council, however, was difperfed by an infurreftion of the citizens, but at the next meeting in the city of Nice, in 787, which was protefted by a military force, a decree was paffed for refloring the worlhip of images. Adrian approved the decree, but in the weftern church it was deemed heretical and dangerous. Charlemagne condemned the innovation, and the French and Englilh clergy con¬ curred in oppoling it. A treatife, containing 120 heads of refutation, was circulated, as the work of Charlemagne, under the title of “ The Caroline Books,” in oppofition to the decree of the council.

Two brothers, Stephen and John Mont¬ golfier, natives of Annonay, and mailers of a confider- abie paper manufailory there, had turned their thoughts towards this project as early as the middle of the year 1782. The idea was firft fuggefted by the natural afcent of the fmoke and clouds in the atmofphere 5 and their defign was to form an artificial cloud, by encloling the fmoke in a bag, and making it carry up the cover¬ ing along with it. Towards the middle of November Account of that year, the experiment xvas made at Avignon with ku experi- a fine filk bag of a parallelepiped fnape. By applying oaeuu burning paper to the lower aperture, the air wras rare¬ fied, and the bag afcended in the atmofphere, and ftruck rapidly againil the ceiling.

A public exhibition was next made on the yth of June 1783, at Annonay,.' where a vaft number of fpeflators afi'embled. An im- menfe bag of linen, lined with paper, and containing upwards of 23,000 cubic feet, was found to have a power of lifting about 500 pounds, including its owm weight. The operation was begun by burning chop¬ ped ilraw and wool under the aperture of the machine, which immediately began to fwell: and after being fet at liberty afcended into the atmofphere. In ten minutes it had afcended 6000 feet 5 and when its force was ex- haufted it fell to the ground at the didance of 7668 feet from the place from whence it fet out","Annonay, Avignon, Annonay",FR,4,France,Europe
"“ We have already obferved (fay they), that if we did not deviate more than 22 degrees, it was becaufe tire wind carried us at the rate of 24 miles an hour ; and it is natural to judge, that, if the wind had been twice as ftrong as it was, we fhould not have devia¬ ted more than one-half of what we a&ually did 5 and, on the contrary, if the wind had been only half as ftrong, our deviation would have been proportion- ably greater.” Having thus related all that has been done with re-Contrivan- gard to the conducing of aeroftatic machines through ces ufed to the atmofphere, we iliall now relate the attempts that prtvc-r.t the have been made to leffen their expence by falling upon Q fome contrivance to afcend without throwing out bal- a]r/ laft, and to defcend without lofing any of the inllam- mable air. The firft attempt of this kind was made Voyage of by the duke de Chartres j who, on the 15th of July the duke 1784, afcended with the two brothers, Roberts, and ade cliar- fourth perfon, from the Park of St Cloud. The balloontres’ was of an oblong form, made to afcend with its longeft diameter horizontally, and meafured 55 feet in length and 24 in breadth. It contained within it a fmaller balloon filled with common air j by blowing into which with a pair of bellows, and thus throwing in a conli- derable quantity of common air, it was luppofed that the machine would become fufticiently heavy to de¬ fcend, efpecially as, by the inflation of the internal bag, the inflammable air in the external one would be con- denfed into a fmaller Ipace, and thus become fpecifically heavier. The voyage, however, was attended with fuch circumftances as rendered it impoffible to know what would have been the event of the fcheme. The power of afeent with which they fet out, feems to have been very great; as, in three minutes after parting with the ground, they were loft in the clouds, and involved ;nvoi_ in fuch a denfe vapour that they could fee neither thevedin Iky nor the earth. In this fituation they feemed to bedark clouds, attacked by a whirlwind, which, befides turning the , balloon three times round from right to left, fliccked a^hh-I-'7 and beat it fo about, that they were rendered incapable wind, of ufing any of the means propofed for directing their courfe, and the filk fluff of which the helm had been compofed was even torn away. No feene can be con¬ ceived more terrible than that in which they were now involved. An immenfe ocean of fhapelefs clouds rolled one upon another below them, and feemed to prevent any return to the earth, which ftill continued inviilble, while the agitation of the balloon became greater every moment. In this extremity they cut the cords which held the interior balloon, and of confequence it fell down upon the aperture of the. tube that came from the large balloon into the boat, and flopped it up",Chartres,FR,4,France,Europe
"They were then driven upwards by a gufl of wind from below, which carried them to the top of that ilormy vapour in which they had been involved. They now faw the fun without a cloud ; but the heat of his rays, , with the diminiflied denfity of the atmolphere had fuch an effect cm the inflammable air; that the balloon feemed every Hiftory. A E R O S T every moment ready to' burft. To prevent this they introduced a Hick through the tube, in order to pufh away -the inner balloon from its aperture : but the ex¬ pansion of the inllammable air pulhed it fo clofe,, that all attempts of this kind proved ineffectuah It was now, however, become abfolutely neceflaiy to give vent to a very confiderable quantity of the inflammable air; for which purpofe the duke de Chartres himfelf bored two holes in the balloon, which tore open for the length of feven or eight feet. On this they defcended with great rapidity; and would have fallen into a lake, had they not haftily thrown out 60 pounds of ballalt, which enabled them juft to reach the water’s edge",Chartres,FR,4,France,Europe

This took place on the 7th of Dover. January 1785, being a clear frofty morning, with a wind, barely perceptible, at N. N. W. The operation of filling the balloon began at 10,o’clock, and, at three quarters after 12, every thing was ready for their de¬ parture. At one o’clock Mr Blanchard defired the boat to be puftred off, which now flood only twTo feet eliftant from that precipice fo finely deferibed by Sbake- (peare in - his tragedy of King Lear. As the balloon A T I O N. 219 vTas fcarcely fufficient to carry txvo, they were obliged to throw out all their ballaft except three bags of 10 pounds each; when they at laft rofe gently ; though making very little w-ay on account of there being lo little wind. At a quarter after one o’clock, the ba¬ rometer, w-hich on the cliff flood at 29.7 inches, was nowr fallen to 27.3, and the weather proved fine and w-arm. They had now a moft beautiful profpedt of the fouth coaft of England, and were able to count 37 villages upon it. After pafling over feveral vef- fels, they found that the balloon, at 50 minutes after one, was defeending, (Jr which they threw7 out a fack and a half of ballaft ; but as they faw that it ftill de¬ fcended, and with much greater velocity than be¬ fore, they now threw- out all the ballaft. This ftill proving ineffeftual, they next threw7 out a parcel of books they carried along w-ith them, w-hich made the balloon afeend, w-hen they were about midway betwixt France and England. At a quarter paft tw-o, finding themfelves again defeending, they threw- aw ay the re¬ mainder of their books, and, ten minutes after, they had a moft enchanting profpeft of the French coaft ","Dover, Dover","FR,US",4,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"Still, however, the machine defcended ; and as they had now no more ballaft, they were obliged to throw away their provifions, the wings of their boat, and every thing they could poftibly fpare. “ We threw away (fays Dr Jeffries) our only bottle, which, in its defeent caft out a fleam like fmoke, w-ith a rufli- ing noife ; and when it ftruck the water, w-e heard and felt the flrock very perceptibly on our car and balloon.’’ All this proving infufficient to ftop the defeent of the balloon, they next threw out their anchors and cords, and at laft ftripped off their clothes, faftening them¬ felves to certain flings, and intending to cut away the boat as their laft refource. They had now the fatisfac- tion, however, to find that they were rifing ; and as they paffed over the high lands between Cape Blanc and Calais the machine rofe- very faft, and carried them to a greater height than they had been fit any former part of their voyage. They defcended fafely among fome trees in the foreft of Guiennes, where there was juft opening enough to admit them",Calais,FR,4,France,Europe

"be near an ounce. Let its capacity be increafed 16 times 5 and the tendency to arife will be equivalent to a pound, _ though, this may be done without making the machine 16 times heavier than before. It is cer¬ tain, however, that all aeroflatic machines have a ten¬ dency to produce or preferve heat within them, which would by no means be imagined by thofe who have not made the experiment. When Meffrs Charles and Roberts made their longeft aerial voyage of 150 miles, they, had the curiofity to try the temperature of the air within their balloon, in comparifon with that of the external atmofphere ; and at this time they found that, when the external atmofphere was 63°, the ther¬ mometer within the balloon rtood at 104°. Such a difference of temperature muft have given a machine at the. magnitude which carried them a confiderable amending power independent of any other caufe, as it amounted to 41 grains on every cubic foot 5 and there¬ fore m a machine containing 50,000 fuch feet would have been almoft 200 pounds. Hence we may eafilv account for what happened at Dijon, and is recorded by Mr Morveau. A balloon, intended to be filed with inflammable air, being completed, was, by way of . tnal> with common air, and in that ftate expofed to the atmofphere. Now it was obferved, and indeed a limilar oblervation bad been made before, that the air within the.balloon was much hotter than the cir¬ cumambient air : the thermometer in the former flood at 120° } whereas in the latter, even when the fun inone upon it, the thermometer flood at 84°. This fbowed a confiderable degree of rarefatlion within the balloon 5 and confequently it was fufpefled, that, by means of this rarefaction alone, efpecially if it were to increafe a little, the balloon might afcend. On the 30th of May, about noon, the wind being rather Itrong, agitated the balloon fo that two men were em¬ ployed to take care of it 5 but, notwithflanding all their endeavours, it efcaped from its confinement ; and, lifting up about 65 potmds weight of cords, equa¬ torial circle, &c. rofe many feet high, and, palling over fome houfes, went to the diflance of 250 yards where at length it was properly fecured.” ’ This.difference between the external and internal heat being fo very confiderable, muff have a great in¬ fluence upon aeroflatic machines, and will undoubtedly influence thole filled with inflammable air as well as the other kind. Nor is it unlikely, that the fhort time, which many aerial voyagers have been able to continue in the atmofphere may have been owing to the want of a method of preferving this internal heat, ic may naturally be iuppofed, and indeed it has always been found, that balloons, in pafling through the high¬ er regions of the atmofphere, acquire a very confider¬ able quantity of moiflure, not only from the rain or mow they fometimes meet with, but even from the dew and vapour which condenfes upon them. On this an evaporation will inftantly take place ; and, as it is the property of this operation to produce a very violent cold, the internal heat of the balloon muff be foon ex- haufted in fuch a manner as to make it become fpeci- fically heavier than the common atmofphere, and con¬ fequently defeend in a much fhorter time than it would have done by the mere lofs of air.

All thefe, except a few of late date, have ac¬ quired a wonderful degree of fertility. The circum¬ ference of this zone, or great circle, according to Re- cupero, isxfT&t lefs than 70 or 80 miles. It is every¬ where fucceeded by the Regions culta ; which is much broader than the reft, and extends on all fides to the foot of the mountain. Here terrible devaftations are fometimes committed by the eruptions 3 and the whole region is likewife full of conical mountains thrown up by them.

"Voyage of Planno is faid to have depofited, at his return, Hanno. the journal of his voyage in the temple of Saturn ; which may perhaps account for the means of its pxefer- vation. It begins by Hating, that “ it was decreed by the Carthaginians that Planno fliould undertake a voy¬ age beyond the Pillars of Plercules, and found Liby- phoenician cities. He failed, accordingly, with 60 (hips of 50 oars each, and a body of men and women to the number of 30,000, and proviftons and other neceflaries.” From the extent of this plan of colonization, or rather of eftablifhing permanent garrifons, upon the w’eftern coafts of Africa, it is evident that thefe coafts muft, in fome meafure, have been previoufly examined. Major Rennel, who has inveftigated the fubjedt with great ac¬ curacy, with a reference to the journal of the voyage, is of opinion that the Carthaginian or Libyphoenician cities founded by Planno, were all fttuated to the fouth of the ftrait of Gibraltar, and to the northward of the river Senegal j and that all of them, excepting one at Cerne, now called Arguin, were placed to the north of Cape Bojador. To the fouthward of Cerne, Hanno during his voyage made two expeditions; but it does not appear that he made any attempt to fix an eftablifti- ment beyond the limits now mentioned. On his firft expedition, he feems to have failed into the river Sene¬ gal, as may be fuppofed from the defeription given j for it is faid to be “ large and broad, and full of cro- Africa, codiles and river horfes”. During the fame voyage, ' ^ Hanno made a fecond expedition louthward, apparent¬ ly for the fake of difeovery. He appears to have doubled Cape Verd, and to have failed acrofs the mouth of the Gambia. His voyage is faid to have terminated at a place which he calls the Southern Horn, fuppofed to be either at Sierraleona, or, at a little diftance to the fouth of it, at Sherbro. It is evident, from the general ftyle of the journal, that the Carthaginians, at the time of this voyage, wrere altogether unacquaint¬ ed wuth the interior ftate of the country on this wreftern quarter of Africa. Excepting the mere defeription of the coaft, and its windings and bays, every thing is marvellous, and apparently fabulous. They talk of having caught two women covered with hair, whofe {kins they brought to Carthage, meaning, in all pro¬ bability, two monkeys of fome of the unknow n fpecies which abound in the country of the Negroes. They alfo talk of ftreams of fire, and of rivers of fire which feem- ed to be running into the fea. At one place, during the night, they faw a country which w as on fire: and af¬ terwards they faw another country full of fires ; in the middle of which was a lofty fire, larger than the others, wEich feemed to touch the ftars. When day came, they difeovered this elevated fire to be a large hill, which they called the chariot of the gods. Thefe wonders have been explained to us by later travellers; who remark that it is the cuftom, at certain feefons cf the year, in the country of the Negroes, to fet fire to the dry grafs 5 and that on thefe occafions, during the night, the whole territory feems to be a ftieet of flame. Defeription With regard to Africa in general, Herodotus de-of Africa feribes it in this fummary w ay : “ All that part of by Herodo- Libya towards the northern fea (Mediterranean), from Egypt to the promontory of Soloeis (now Cape Cantin on the coaft of Morocco) which terminates the third divifion of the earth, is inhabited by the different nations of the Libyans ; that diftridt alone excepted in poffeffion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. The remoter parts of Libya beyond the fea coaft, and the people who inhabit its borders, are infefted by various beafts of prey.—The country yet more difant is a parched and immeafarable defert.'"" Here this ancient hiftorian clearly diftingunhes three belts or regions parallel to the Mediterranean, the northernmoft of which we muft conceive to have been that which extended along the fea coaft, and was bounded on the fouth by Mount Atlas, and other ridges. The middle one is nowr called the Country of Dates, becaufe the inhabitants chiefly live on that fruit ; and the third is the great African defert. Beyond thefe, however, Herodotus had heard of a fourth region, belonging to the negroes : for, in- another place he divides the inhabitants of Africa ge¬ nerally into two races (with the exception of ftrangers, viz. the Phoenicians and the Greeks). The natives (fays he) are the Africans and Ethiopians, one of which poffeffes the northern, and the other the fouthern part of Africa.”—By thefe nations are evidently intended the Moors and the Negroes, which two claffes are as dif- tinft at the prefent day as they were in ancient times",Carthage,"GI,LY,SN,GM,EG,MA,TN",4,"Gibraltar,Libya,Senegal,Gambia,Egypt,Morocco,Tunisia","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa"

She endeavoured to gain the women : but inftead of fuffefing themfelves to be per- fuaded, they applied to Leonidas the other king of Lacedfemon, and humbly befought him to fruftrate the defigns of his colleague. Leonidas durft not op- pofe it openly, for fear of irritating the people ; to whom the reformation was agreeable, becaufe they found their account in it. He contented himfelf with countermining it by intrigues, and fowing fufpicions as if Agis had afpired to tyranny, by pulling down the rich and raifmg the poor. Agis did not fail to pro- pofe his new laws to the fenate, relating to the dif- charge of debts, and a new divifion of the lands. Leo¬ nidas, being fupported by the rich, oppofed this pro¬ ject fo ftrongly, that there was one voice more againft it than for it. He paid dear for his fuccefs in this af¬ fair. Lyfander, one of the Ephori, who had been the grand promoter of the reformation, called him to account; alleged the celeilial figns } and put to death Cleombrotus, a prince of the royal blood and fon-in- law to Leonidas, to make fare of the kingdom. Leo¬ nidas being frightened at this, took refuge in a tem¬ ple ; whither his daughter, the wife of Cl^ombrotus, followed him. He was fummoned ; and becaufe he did not appear, he was degraded of his dignity, which was conferred on Cleombrotus. He obtained leave to retire to Tegtea. The new Ephori had Lyfander and Mandroclidas tried for innovation : thefe perfuaded the two kings to unite and turn out thefe Ephori. The thing was brought about} but not without a great up¬ roar in the city. Agefilaus, one of the Ephori that fucceeded thofe who were juft turned out, would have caufed Leonidas to be killed on the way to Tegaea, if Agis had not fent him a ftrong guard. The reforma¬ tion might then have been eftablifhed, if Agelilaus had not found means to elude the good intentions of the two kings. Whilft this was tranfadling, the A- chaians aiked afliftance *, which was given them, and Agis had the command of the troops. He acquired a good deal of reputation in this campaign. At his return, he found his affairs fo embroiled by the ill conduct of Agefilaus, that it was impoffible for him to maintain himfelf. Leonidas was recalled to Lacedaemon : Agis retired into one temple and Cleomenes into another. The wife of the latter be¬ haved herfelf in fuch a manner that ihe became the ad¬ miration of every body. Leonidas wras contented with baniihing his fon-in-law j after which he applied him¬ felf entirely to the ruin of Agis. One of the Ephori, who had no mind to return wrhat Agefiftrata had lent him, was the principal inftrument of the misfortune of this family. Agis never went out of his fanfluary but to bathe. One clay, as he was returning from thence to the temple, he was feized by that Ephorus and carried to prifon. Then he wras brought to his trial and condemned to death, and delivered to the executioner. His mother and grandmother ufed all the intreaty and importunity imaginable, that, as he was king of Lacedteinoxa, he might at leaft be permit' 84 ] A G I ted to plead his caufe before the people. But they Agiftment were apprehenfive left his w'ords would make too great . II an impreflion, and therefore they ordered him to be Agltator\ ftrangled that very hour.

After having adopted thefe precautions, it may frill be ne¬ ceffary, with a view to fecure a found and full crop, to plunge the feed into a Itrong pickle of fait and wa¬ ter, with a view to float the lighter grains, which ought to be flammed off and laid afide for poultry, to which they may be given after being walked in frelh water.

Our author feems inclined to believe the efficacy of this preparation; but thinks there may be feme reafon to apprehend danger in the ufe of fuch a perni¬ cious mineral, either through the careleffhefs of fervants, or handling of the feed by the perfon who fows it. The farmer above mentioned, however, during all the time he ufed it, never experienced any inconvenience either to himfelf, the feedfman, or even to the poultry; though thefe laft, we fliould have thought, would have been peculiarly liable to accidents from arfenicated feed. The preparation is made by pounding the arfenic extremely fine, boiling it in wa¬ ter, and drenching the feed -with the decodlion. “ In Hri&nefs, fays Mr Marfhall* the arfenic flrould be levigated fufficiently fine, to be taken up and waffied over with water, reducing the fediment until it be fine enough to be carried over in the fame manner. The ufual method of preparing the liquor is to boil one ounce of white arfenic, finely pow’dered, in a gallon of water, from one to two hours; and to add to the decoftion as much water or Hale urine as will increafe the liquor to two gallons. In this liquor the feed is, ■ or ought to be, immerged, ftirring k about in fuch a manner as to faturate effe&ually the downy end of each grain. This done, and the liquor drawn off, the feed is confidered as fit for the feed balket, without being candied with lime, or any other preparation. A bulhel of wheat has been obferved to take up about a gallon of liquor. The price of arfenic is about 6d",Hale,GB,4,United Kingdom,Europe
"Culture of The common method is, to fow oats on new-plough- eats. ed land in the month of March, as foon as the ground is tolerably dry. If it continues wet all the month of L T U R E. 39* March, it is too late to venture them after. It is much Culture o? better to fummer-fallow, and to fow wheat in the au- ^p^^siar tumn. But the preferable method, efp'ecially in clay L| |—, foil, is to turn over the field after harved,_ and to lay it open to the influences of frod and air, which leffen the tenacity of clay, and reduce it to a free mould. The furface-foil by’ this means is finely mellowed for recep¬ tion of the feed y and it would be a pity to bury it by a fecond ploughing before fowing. In general, the bulk of clay foils are rich > and fkilful ploughing with¬ out dung, will probably give a better crop, than un- Ikilful ploughing with dung","March, March",GB,4,United Kingdom,Europe
"The method commonly ufed of dreffing carfe clay for oats, is, not to dir it till the ground be dry in the fpring, which feldorn happens before the id of March, and the feed is fown as foon after as the ground is dif¬ fidently dry for its reception. Frod has a dronger ef- fed on fuch clays than on natural clay. And if the field be laid open before winter, it is rendered fo loofe by frod as to be foon drenched in water. The particles at the fame time are fo fmall, as that the fird drought in fpring makes the furface cake or crud. I he difficulty of reducing this crud into mould for covering the oat- feed, has led farmers to delay ploughing till the month of March. But we are taught by experience, that this foil ploughed before winter, is fooner dry than when the ploughing is delayed till fpring j and as early low¬ ing is a great advantage, the objedion of the fuperficial eroding is eafily removed by the fird barrow above de- feribed, which will produce abundance of mould for covering the feed. The ploughing before winter not only procures early fowing, but has another advantage","March, March",GB,4,United Kingdom,Europe
"STorfolk In Norfolk this kind of grain is much lefs cultiva- eultivation tec} barley j and the only fpecies obferved by •® oa s* ]\.lr Marfhall is a kind of white oat, which grows quick¬ ly, and feems to be of Dutch extraftion. Oats are cultivated occalionally on all kinds of foils, but more efpecially on cold heavy land, or on very light, unpro¬ ductive, heathy foils. They moll frequently fucceed wheat, or ley ground barley : “ but (fays our author there are no ellablilhed rules refpe&ing any part of the culture of this time-ferving crop.” The culture of the ground is ufually the fame with that of barley ; the -ground generally undergoing a winter fallow of three or four ploughings, though fometimes they are fown after one ploughing. They are more commonly fown above furrow than barley. The ieed-time is made fubfervient to that of barley, being fometimes fooner and fometimes later than barley feed-time : and Mr Marfhall obferves, that he has fometimes feen them fown in June ; it being obfervable, that oats fown late ripen earlier than barley fown at the fame time. The quantity of feed in Norfolk is from four to five bufhcls per acre j but he does not acquaint us with the pro¬ duce. He mentions a very fingular method of culture Method of fometimes pradtifed in this county, vix. ploughing down ploughing tbe oats after they begin to vegetate, but before they have got above ground ; which is,attended with great fuccefs, even though the ground is turned over with a full furrow7. By this method weeds of every kind are deflroyed, or at leaft checked in fuch a manner as to give the crop an opportunity of getting above them $ and the porofity communicated to the foil is excellent¬ ly wTell adapted to the infant plants of barley j wdiich probably might frequently receive benefit from this operation","Norfolk, Norfolk","US,NL",4,"United States,Netherlands","North America,Europe"

"265 Manage¬ ment of feed in a dry feafon As foon as tlie former crop is off lire field, let the ridges be gathered with as deep a furrow as the foil will admit, beginning at the crown and ending at the furrows. This ploughing loofens the whole ioil, giv¬ ing free accefs to the air and froft. Soon after, begin a fecond ploughing in the following manner : Let the field be divided by parallel lines crofs the ridges, with intervals of thirty feet or fo. Plough once round an interval, beginning at the edges, and turning the earth towTard the middle of the interval } wdiich covers a foot or fo of the ground formerly ploughed. Within that foot plough another round fimilar to the former 5 and, after that, other rounds, till the whole interval be fi- niihed, ending at the middle. Initead of beginning al the edges, and ploughing toward the middle, it will have the fame eflfeft to begin at the middle, and to plough toward the edges. Plough the other intervals in the fame manner. As by this operation the furrows of the ridges will be pretty much filled up, let them be cleared and water-furrowed without delay. By this method, the field will be left waving like a plot in a kitchen garden, ridged up for winter. In this form, the field is kept perfe£tly dry 5 for befide the capital furrows that feparate the ridges, every ridge has a number of crofs furrows that carry the ram mftantly to the capital furrowrs. In hanging grounds retentive of moifture, the parallel lines above mentioned ought not to be perpendicular to the furrows of the ridges, but to be directed a little dowmward, in order to cairy rain water the more haftily to thefe furrows. If the crround be clean, it may lie in that ftate winter and fpring, till the time of feed-furrowing. If weeds hap¬ pen to rife, they mull be deftroyed by ploughing, or braking, or both *, for there cannot be worfe huihan- dry, than to put the feed into dirty ground. ",Manage,BE,4,Belgium,Europe
"The county of Norfolk, according to Mr Marlhall, Cultivatiosr is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of this grain, b®r|ey ^ the ftrongeft foil not being too heavy, and the lighteft or 1 being able to bear it } and fo well verfed are the Nor¬ folk farmers in the cultivation of it, that the barley di this county is defined for feed throughout thewhole kingdom. It is here fown after wheat or turnips, and in fome very light lands it is fown after the fecond year’s ley. After wheat, the feed time of the latter being finiftied, and the ftubble trampled down with bullocks, the land is ploughed with a ihallow furrow for a winter fallow for barley. In the beginning of March the land is harrowed and crofs-ploughed ; or if it be wet, the ridges are reverfed. In April it receives another ploughing lengthwife; and at feed time it is harrowed, rolled, fowed, and the furface rendered as fmooth and level as poflible. After turnips the foil is broken up as fait as the turnips are taken off; if early in winter by rice-balking, a- praftice already explaiu- en 5 but if late, by a plain ploughing.

"The firft and third forts are principally, cultivated 5 the winter barley is as yet new to the diftria. Bactledoor barley was formerly very common, but is now almoft entirely difufed.

But ftubbles are in general broken by a winter-fallow of three or four ploughings j the feed being fown broad- caft and ploughed in about three inches deep with the laft'ploughing.”—In the Vale of Gloucefter they are planted by wromen, and hoed by women and children, once, twice, and fometimes thrice 5 which gives the crop, when the foil is fufficiently free from, root-weeds, the appearance of a garden in the fummer time, and produces a plentiful crop in harveft. The diftance between the row’s varies from 10 to 14 inches, but 12 may be conlidered as the medium j the diftance in the rows two inches. In the Cheltenham quarter of the diftrift, they fet the peas not in continued lines, but in clumps; making the holes eight or ten inches di- ftant from one another, putting a number of peafe in¬ to each hole.
