"AARON, high-prieft of the Jews, and brother to Mofes, was by the father’s fide great grandfon, and by the mother’s, grandfon of Levi. By God’s command he met Mofes at the foot of Mount Horeb, and they went together into Egypt to deliver the children of If- rael: he had a great ftiare in all that Mofes did for their deliverance. The Scriptures callhim the prophet of Mofes, and he afted in that capacity after the Ifraelites had paffed over the Red fea. He afcended Mount Si¬ nai with two of his fons, Nadab and Abihu, and fe- venty elders of the people ; but neither he nor they went higher than half way, from whence they faw the glory of God ; only Mofes and Jofhua went to the top, where they ftaid forty days. During their abfence, Aaron, overcome by the people’s eager entreaties, fet up the golden calf, which the Ifraelites worlhipped by his confent. This calf has given rife to various conjec¬ tures. Some rabbles maintain that he did not make the golden calf, but only threw the gold into the fire, to get rid of the importunities of the people ; and that certain magicians who mingled with the Ifraelites at their departure from Egypt, call this gold into the figure of a calf. According to fome authors, the fear of falling a facrifice to the refentment of the people, by giving a refufal, made Aaron comply with their defire : and they allege alfo, that he hoped to elude their requeft, by demanding of the wromen to contribute their ear rings, imagining they would rather choofe to remain without a vilible deity, than be de¬ prived of their perfonal ornaments. This affair of the golden calf happened in the third month after the If- 2 ] AAR raelites came out of Egypt. In the firft month of the Aaron following year, Aaron was appointed by God high- A | prieft ; which office he executed during the time that ^,alfcns' the children of Ifrael continued in the wildernefs.

"Abyffinian Mr Bruce makes mention of a tradition among the tradition Abydinians, which, they fay, has exided among them concerning £rom tjme immemorial, that very foon after the fiood, Culh the grandfon of Noah, with his family, paffed through Atbara, then without inhabitants, till they came to the ridge of mountains which feparates that country from the high lands of Abydmia. Here, dill terrified with the thoughts of the deluge, and appre- henfive of a return of the fame calamity, they chofe to dwell in caves made in the fides of thefe moun¬ tains, rather than trud themfelves in the plains of At¬ bara ; and our author is of opinion, that the tropical rains, which they could not fail to meet with in their journey fouthward, and which would appear like the return of the deluge, might induce them to take up Original their habitations in thefe high places. Be this as it ^fons will, he informs us that it is an undoubted fa£l, “ that Cuihites. here the Culhites, with unparalleled indudry,. and with indruments utterly unknown to us, formed to them¬ felves commodious, yet wonderful habitations in the heart of mountains of granite and marble, which re¬ main entire in great numbers to this day, and promife to do fo till the confummation of all things.” The Culhites having once edablilhed themfelves among thefe mountains, continued to form habitations of the like kind in all the neighbouring ones ; and thus following the different chains (for they never chofe to defeend into the low country), fpread the arts and Iciences, which they cultivated, quite acrofs the Afri¬ can continent from the eadern to the wedern ocean",Atbara,SD,4,Sudan,Africa

So intolerable, however, are its attacks to the cattle, that they no fooner hear its buz¬ zing, than they forfake their food, and run about till they fall down with fright, fatigue, and hunger.

Thefe differed in their appearance from the Ethiopians, having long hair, and the features of Europeans ; and were of a very dark complexion, though not at all like tiro black- moors or negroes. They lived in the plain country in huts or moveable habitations, attending their cattle, and wandering up and down as various circunlftances required. By aCling as carriers to the Culhites, they became a great and powerful people, poffefling vaft numbers of cattle, as well as a very confiderable ex¬ tent of territory.

About the end of the 17th century, a number of Francifcans from Italy fettled at Cairo in Egypt, and were maintained at the expence of the fathers in Paleftine, though pre¬ tending to be independent of their fuperior the guar¬ dian of Jerufalem. The latter, difpleafed at this me¬ thod of proceeding, offered to fupply the miflion to Egypt entirely at the expence of Paleftine, and like- wife to furnifh from thence miflionaries capable of in- ftru&ing the people in the Chriftian religion. This propofal meeting with a favourable reception at Rome, .a new fet of miflionaries from Jerufalem, called by our author Capuchins, appeared at Cairo j from whence the Francifcans were banifhed, only two of them being allowed to remain in that city. The others returned to Rome j where, finding that they could not re-efta- blifli themfelves by fair means, they had recourfe to artifice and fidlion. It was now pretended, that, on the expulfion of the Jefuits from Abyflinia, a great number of Catholic Chriftians had fled into the neigh¬ bouring countries of Nubia and Sennaar, where they found themfelves fo grievoufly oppreffed by the Ma¬ hometans, that, without fome fpiritual afliftance, they would be under the neceflity of renouncing their re¬ ligion.

"It is Hill more important in another view : it has en¬ couraged us to make fimilar attempts in other cafes, and has fupplied us with a fad! to which an ingenious mind can eafily fancy fomething analogous in many ab- flrufe operations of nature, and thus it enables us- to give fome fort of explanation of them. Accordingly this ufe has been moft liberally made of the mechanical theory of found ; and there is now fcarcely any pheno¬ menon, either of matter or mind, that has not been explained in a manner fomewdrat fimilar. But we are forry to fay that thefe explanations have done no credit to philofophy. They are, for the moft part, ftrongly marked with that precipitate and felf-conceited impa¬ tience wftiich has always charadlerized the inveftigations condudled folely by ingenious fancy. The ccnfe- quences of this procedure have been no lefs fatal to the progrefs of true knowdedge in modem times than in the fchools of ancient Greece j and the ethereal philofophers cf this age, like the followers of Ariftotle of old, have filled ponderous volumes with nonfenfe s t 1 c s. 143 and error. It is ftrange, however, that this ihould be Pu-liminary the effedt of a great and a fuccefsful ftep in philofophy : h^a_ But the fault is in the philofophers, not in the fcience.. _ j Nothing can be mere certain than the account which Newton has given of the propagation of a certain clafs of undulations in an elaftic fluid. But this procedure of nature cannot be feen with diftindfnefs and precifion by any but well-informed mathematicians. They alone can reft with unftiaken confidence on the conclufions legitimately deduced from the Newtonian theorems } and even they can infure fucceis only by treading with the moft fcrupulous caution the fteps of this patient philofopher. But few have done this \ and wTe may venture to fay, that not one in ten cf thofe ivlio em¬ ploy the Newtonian dodtrines of elaftic undulations ror the explanation of other phenomena have taken the trouble, or indeed were able, to go through the fteps of the fundamental propofition (Prin. II. 50, &c.) But the general refults are lo plain, and admit of fuch nn- preflive illuftration, that they draw the affent of the moft carelefs reader ; and all imagine that they under- ftand the explanation, and perceive the whole proce¬ dure of nature. Emboldened therefore by this fuc¬ cefsful ftep in philofophy, they, without heiitation, fancy fimilar intermediums in other cafes \ and as air has been found to be a vehicle for found, they have fuppofed that fomething which they call ether, fome- how refembling air, is the vehicle of viiion. Others have proceeded farther, and have held that ether, or another fomething like air, is the vehicle of fenfaticn in general, from the organ to the brain : nay, we have got a great volume called A Theory of Man, where all our fenfations, emotions, affedhons, thoughts, and purpofes or volitions, are faid to be fo many vibrations of another fomething equally unfeen, gratuitous, and incompetent •, and, to crown all, this exalted dodlrine, w7hen logically profecuted, muft terminate in the dif- covery of thofe vibrations which pervade all others, and which conftitute wdiat we have been accuftomed to venerate by the name Deity. Such muf be the ter¬ mination of this philofophy j and a truly philofophical differtation on the attributes of the Divine Being can be nothing elfe than an accurate defeription or thefe vi¬ brations ! This is not a needlefs and declamatory rbapfody. If the explanation of found can be legitimately transferred to thofe other claftes of phenomena, thefe are certain refults 5 and if fo, all the difeoveries made by New ton are but the glimmerings cf the morning, when compar-- ed with this meridian fplendour.

"The knowledge of the ancients concerning Africa feems to have been, in a great degree, limited to the countries adjoining to the Mediterranean or to the Red .fea.

Previous to his time, the whole fea coaft of this continent had been explored by the conduftors of an expedition fitted out by Mecho one of the kings of Egypt. It is to be Expedition oblerved that this TSecho took Sidon, and reduced of Necho Phoenicia and Paleftine.

"ven by Elerodotus of this remarkable tranfaftion : “ Except in that particular part which is contiguous to Herodotus’s Afia, the whole of Africa is furrounded by the fea. account <4 The firft perfon who has proved this, was, as far as we ’*• are able to judge, Necho king of Egypt. When he had defifted from his attempt to join by a canal the Nile with the Arabian gulf, he difpatched fome veffels under the conduft of Phoenicians, with direftions to pafsby the Columns of Hercules, and, after penetrating the Northern ocean, to return to Egypt. Thefe Phoe¬ nicians, taking their courfe from the Red fea, entered into the Southern ocean. On the approach of autumn they A F R [ 255 ] A F R Africa, tliey landed at Libya, and planted feme corn in the v——V""-""’ place where they happened to find themfelves : when this was ripe, and they had cut it down, they again de¬ parted. Having thus confumed two years, in the third they paffed the Columns of Hercules, and returned to E- gypt. Their relation may obtain attention from others, but to me it feems incredible 5 for they affirmed that, having failed round Africa, they had the fun on their right hand. Thus was Africa, for the firft time, known.” Many of the mofl eminent of the ancient kiftorians and geographers regarded this account of the circum¬ navigation of Africa as altogether fabulous, chiefly in confequence of the llory concerning the appearance affumed by the great celeftial bodies in the courfe of the voyage, which was then unintelligible, from the imper- feft ftate of the fcience of aftronomy. But the very cir- cumftances which, among the ancients, excited a doubt about the exiftence or fuccefs of fuch a voyage, mull now be regarded as affording the molt fatisfadtory in¬ ternal evidence of the veracity of the ancient Phoeni¬ cian navigators","Hercules, Hercules","EG,US,LY",4,"Egypt,United States,Libya","Africa,North America,Africa"
"The Carthaginians were the rivals of the Egyptians in commerce, and muff undoubtedly have explored a great part of the coaft of Africa j but, according to the ufual cautious and monopolizing fpirit of com¬ mercial Hates, it is probable that they concealed their difeoveries from other nations. As almofl no monu¬ ments of their literature now exift, we are deprived of the means of invefligating the full extent of their geo¬ graphical knowledge. One important document has, however, reached our times, which demonftrates the enterprizing fpirit of that people. This is, an appa¬ rently abridged journal of a voyage to the weftern coaft of Africa, undertaken by Planno the Carthaginian, about 30 or 40 years after the expedition above men¬ tioned under Necho king of Egypt. Herodotu^does not feem to have been informed of this undertaking of Han- no ; nor does Pliny appear to have feen the journal of the voyage, though he is no ftranger to its contents",,EG,4,Egypt,Africa
"Voyage of Planno is faid to have depofited, at his return, Hanno. the journal of his voyage in the temple of Saturn ; which may perhaps account for the means of its pxefer- vation. It begins by Hating, that “ it was decreed by the Carthaginians that Planno fliould undertake a voy¬ age beyond the Pillars of Plercules, and found Liby- phoenician cities. He failed, accordingly, with 60 (hips of 50 oars each, and a body of men and women to the number of 30,000, and proviftons and other neceflaries.” From the extent of this plan of colonization, or rather of eftablifhing permanent garrifons, upon the w’eftern coafts of Africa, it is evident that thefe coafts muft, in fome meafure, have been previoufly examined. Major Rennel, who has inveftigated the fubjedt with great ac¬ curacy, with a reference to the journal of the voyage, is of opinion that the Carthaginian or Libyphoenician cities founded by Planno, were all fttuated to the fouth of the ftrait of Gibraltar, and to the northward of the river Senegal j and that all of them, excepting one at Cerne, now called Arguin, were placed to the north of Cape Bojador. To the fouthward of Cerne, Hanno during his voyage made two expeditions; but it does not appear that he made any attempt to fix an eftablifti- ment beyond the limits now mentioned. On his firft expedition, he feems to have failed into the river Sene¬ gal, as may be fuppofed from the defeription given j for it is faid to be “ large and broad, and full of cro- Africa, codiles and river horfes”. During the fame voyage, ' ^ Hanno made a fecond expedition louthward, apparent¬ ly for the fake of difeovery. He appears to have doubled Cape Verd, and to have failed acrofs the mouth of the Gambia. His voyage is faid to have terminated at a place which he calls the Southern Horn, fuppofed to be either at Sierraleona, or, at a little diftance to the fouth of it, at Sherbro. It is evident, from the general ftyle of the journal, that the Carthaginians, at the time of this voyage, wrere altogether unacquaint¬ ed wuth the interior ftate of the country on this wreftern quarter of Africa. Excepting the mere defeription of the coaft, and its windings and bays, every thing is marvellous, and apparently fabulous. They talk of having caught two women covered with hair, whofe {kins they brought to Carthage, meaning, in all pro¬ bability, two monkeys of fome of the unknow n fpecies which abound in the country of the Negroes. They alfo talk of ftreams of fire, and of rivers of fire which feem- ed to be running into the fea. At one place, during the night, they faw a country which w as on fire: and af¬ terwards they faw another country full of fires ; in the middle of which was a lofty fire, larger than the others, wEich feemed to touch the ftars. When day came, they difeovered this elevated fire to be a large hill, which they called the chariot of the gods. Thefe wonders have been explained to us by later travellers; who remark that it is the cuftom, at certain feefons cf the year, in the country of the Negroes, to fet fire to the dry grafs 5 and that on thefe occafions, during the night, the whole territory feems to be a ftieet of flame. Defeription With regard to Africa in general, Herodotus de-of Africa feribes it in this fummary w ay : “ All that part of by Herodo- Libya towards the northern fea (Mediterranean), from Egypt to the promontory of Soloeis (now Cape Cantin on the coaft of Morocco) which terminates the third divifion of the earth, is inhabited by the different nations of the Libyans ; that diftridt alone excepted in poffeffion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. The remoter parts of Libya beyond the fea coaft, and the people who inhabit its borders, are infefted by various beafts of prey.—The country yet more difant is a parched and immeafarable defert.'"" Here this ancient hiftorian clearly diftingunhes three belts or regions parallel to the Mediterranean, the northernmoft of which we muft conceive to have been that which extended along the fea coaft, and was bounded on the fouth by Mount Atlas, and other ridges. The middle one is nowr called the Country of Dates, becaufe the inhabitants chiefly live on that fruit ; and the third is the great African defert. Beyond thefe, however, Herodotus had heard of a fourth region, belonging to the negroes : for, in- another place he divides the inhabitants of Africa ge¬ nerally into two races (with the exception of ftrangers, viz. the Phoenicians and the Greeks). The natives (fays he) are the Africans and Ethiopians, one of which poffeffes the northern, and the other the fouthern part of Africa.”—By thefe nations are evidently intended the Moors and the Negroes, which two claffes are as dif- tinft at the prefent day as they were in ancient times",Carthage,"GI,LY,SN,GM,EG,MA,TN",4,"Gibraltar,Libya,Senegal,Gambia,Egypt,Morocco,Tunisia","Europe,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa,Africa"

The people •of this coaft he reprefents generally as Nomades, from Egypt weftward to the lake Tritonis, by which he means the leffer Syrtis, or gulf of Kabes ; and the country, he fays juftly, is low and fandy.

"With regard to the interior of Africa the know¬ ledge of Herodotus was very indiftinft. He mentions Ethiopia in a w^ay that in fome meafure correfponds with Nubia, and Abyflinia: “ Ethiopia, (fays he), “ which is the extremity of the habitable world, is contiguous to Arabia on the fouth-weft. It produces gold in great quantities, - elephants with their prodigi¬ ous teeth, trees and (hrubs of every kind, as wrell as ebony. Its inhabitants are alfo remarkable for their * fize, their beauty, and their length of life.” To Ethiopia, however, he gives a wide extent, fo as to in¬ clude A F R [ 257 [ A F R Africa, elude the whole region inhabited by men of a black complexion, as he calls it, the “ extremity of the ha¬ bitable world.” The remoteft fource of the Nile was pire",,ET,4,Ethiopia,Africa
