"ACADEMICS, or Academists, a denomination given to the cultivators of a fpecies of philofophy ori¬ ginally derived from Socrates, and afterwards iilu- ftrated and enforced by Plato, who taught in a grove near Athens, confecrated to the memory of Academus, an Athenian hero 3 from which circumllance this phi¬ lofophy received the name of Academical. Before the days of Plato, philofophy had in a great meafure fal¬ len into contempt. The contradictory fyftems and hy- pothefes which had fucceflively been urged upon the ■world were become lo numerous, that, from a view of this inconftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal fcepticiim was the natural confequence of this conclu- fion. In order to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the human faculties, Plato laid hold of the / principles of the academical philofophy 3 and, in his Phcedo, reafons in the following manner : “ If we are “ unable to difeover truth (fays he), it muft be owing “ to two circumfiances : either there is no truth in “ the nature of things 3 or the mind, from a defecl “ in its powers, is not able to apprehend it. Upon the “ latter fuppofition, all the uncertainty and fluctuation “ in the opinions and judgments of mankind admit of “ an eafy folution : Let us therefore be model!, and “ aferibe our errors to the real weaknefs of our own “ minds, and not to the nature of things themfelves","Plato, Athens, Plato, Plato","CO,US",4,"Colombia,United States","South America,North America"
"A philofopher, polTeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrefs 3 but will feldom fall into errors, or have occafion to alter his opinion alter it is once formed. Vanity and precipitance are the great fources of fcepticifm : hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plunged themfelves into an abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcepticifm. They pretend to diferedit fubjecls that A C A Academy, are plain, Ample, and eafily compreliended : but give w peremptory and deciAve judgments upon things that evidently exceed the limits of our capacity. Of thefe, Berkeley and Hume are the mod confiderable. Berke¬ ley denied the exiftence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a ftep further, and queftioned even the exiftence of ideas 5 but at the fame time has not hefitated to give determined opinions with regard to eternity, providence, and a future ftate, mi¬ raculous interpofitions of the Deity, &c. fubjedls far above the reach of our faculties. In his effay on the academical or fceptical philofophy, he has confounded two very oppoftte fpecies of philofophy. After the days of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firlt aca¬ demy were grofsly corrupted by Arceftlas, Carneades, &c. This might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the academical and fceptical philofophy were fynony- mous terms. But no principles can be of a more oppofite nature than thofe which were inculcated by the old academy of Socrates and Plato, and the fceptical notions which were propagated by Arce- filas, Carneades, and the other difciples of the fucceed- ing academies","Of, Berkeley, Plato, Plato","CO,TR,US",4,"Colombia,Turkey,United States","South America,Asia,North America"

The produce by Mr Crow at Keolin, on a clay foil, was, on an average of fix years, 35 tons per acre; by Mr Smelt at the Leaies, on a fandy gravel, 18 tons per acre ; by Mr Troop at Danby, on an average of fix years, 37 tons per acre: and the general average of all the accounts given by Mr Young, is 36 tons per acre","Of, Young","TR,UY",4,"Turkey,Uruguay","Asia,South America"
"Turnips like wife produce very bulky crops, though Turnips, far inferior to thofe of cabbages. According to Mr Young’s calculations, the finelt foil does not produce above five tons of turnips per acre ; which is indeed a very great difpraportion : but poftibly fuch a quantity of turnips may not be confumed by cattle as of cab¬ bages } an ox, of 80 ftone weight, ate 210 lb. of cab¬ bages m 24 hours, befides feven pounds of hay. 4<> Carrots are found to be an excellent food for cattle Carrots, of all kinds, and are greatly relifhed by them. In a rich fand, according to Mr Young’s account, the pro¬ duce of this root was 200 brflhels per acre. In a finer foil, it was 640 bulbels per acre. A. lean hog was fat¬ ted by carrots in ten days time : he ate I96 lb.; and his fat was very fine, white, firm, and did not boil a- way in the dreffing. They were preferred to turnips by the cattle •, which having tailed the carrots, foon became fo fond of them, as difficultly tc he made to eat the turnips at all. It is probable, indeed, that carrots will make a more wholefome food for cattle than either cabbages or turnips, as they are ftrongly nn- tifeptic; infomuch as to be ufed in poultices fer correfl- ing the f nies of cancers. It is probably Owing to tins, that the milk of cows fed on carrots is never found to have any bad tafte. Six kerfes kept on them through the winter without oats, performed their work as ufual, and looked equally well. This may be looked upon as a proof of their falubrity as a food ; and it certainly can be no detriment to a farmer to be fo much ver- fant in medical matters, as to know the impropriety of giving putrefeent food to his cattle. It is well known what a prodigious difference there is in the health cf the human ipecies when fed on putrid meats, in com¬ panion of what they enjoy when fupplled w ith food cf a contrary nature ; and why may there not be a dif¬ ference in the health of beafis, as wTell as of men, when in fimilar circumftances 1—It is al(o very probable, that as carrots are more folid than cabbages or tur¬ nips, they will go much farther in feeding cattle than either of them. The above-mentioned example of the hog teems fome kind of confirmation of this : he being fed, for ten days together, with 21 lb. lefs weight of carrots, than what an ox devoured of cabbages and hay in one day. There is a great difproportion, it mutt be owned, between the bulk of an c-x and that of a hog; but we can ficarce think that an ox will eat as much at a time as ten hogs. At Pailington in York flu re, 20 work horfes, four bullocks, and fix milk cows, were fed on the carrots that grew on three acres ; from the end of September till the beginning of May ; and the animals never tafted any other food but a little Kay","Young, York","UY,US",4,"Uruguay,United States","South America,North America"
