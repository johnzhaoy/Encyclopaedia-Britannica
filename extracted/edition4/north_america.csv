"ABAUZIT, Fir min, a learned Frenchman, was born at Ufez, in Languedoc, in November 1679. His fa¬ ther died when he was but two years of age. In confe- quence of the revocation of the edict of Nantz, in the time of Louis XIV. to avoid the rigours of perfecution to which the Proteftants of France were expofed, young' Abauzit’s mother, who was a Proteftant, not without difficulty, efcaped with her fon to Geneva, where he remained fecure from danger, and enjoyed the benefit of education. From his 10th to his 19th year, his time was wholly devoted to' literature y and having made great progrefs in languages, he ftudied mathematics, phyfics, and theology. In the year 1698, he travelled into Holland, where he became acquainted with the learn¬ ed Bayle, with Bafnage and Jurieu. Thence he pafs- ed over into England, and was introduced to Sir Ifaac Newton, who entertained a very high opinion of his merit. For this philofopher afterwards fent him his Commercium Epiftolicum, accompanied with a very ho¬ nourable teftimony. “ You are well worthy, fays Nevcton, to judge between Leibnitz and me.” The reputation of Abauzit reached the ears of King Wil¬ liam, who encouraged him by a very handfome offer to fettle in England ; which he declined, and returned to Geneva. In 1715 he entered into the fociety form¬ ed for the purpofe of tranflating the New Teftament into the French language, and contributed valuable affiftance to this work. The chair of philofophy in the univerfity was offered to him by that body in 1723, which he refufed on account of his health and diffidence of his talents. Butin 1727 he accepted of the office of librarian to the city, the duties of which were nei¬ ther burdenfome, nor fubjected him to any particular reftraint","Geneva, Holland, Newton, Geneva","US,FR",4,"United States,France","North America,Europe"

"The writings which Abauzit left behind him are chiefly on religious fubjects. He wrote an “ Effay on the Apocalypfe,” in which he endeavoured to ffiow, that the predictions in that book were to be applied to the deftruction of Jerufalem. This work was tranflated into Englilh} to which a refutation was added, which fatisfied Abauzit fo much that he was miffaken in his views, that he ordered an edition then ready for pub¬ lication in Holland to be flopped.

"It is not however improbable, that his extravagant adulation of his royal mailer, in which he went as far as any other court-chaplain could do, contributed not a little to his rapid preferment. In the preface to a pamphlet which he publilhed, the following fpecimen of ridiculous flattery occurs: Speaking of the king, he lays, “ whofe life hath been fo immaculate and un- tpotted, &c. that even malice ixfelf, which leaves no¬ thing unfearched, could never find true blemilh in it, nor call probable afperfion on it.—Zealous as a Da¬ vid ; learned and wife, the Solomon of our age ; reli¬ gious as Jolias ; careful of fpreading Chrilt’s faith as Conftantine the Great •, jull as Mofes j undefiled in all his ways as a Jehofhaphat and Hezekiah 5 full of clemency as another Theodolius.”—If Mr Walpole had been this pafiage, he certainly would not have faid, that “ honeit Abbot could not flatter.” His great zeal for the Protellant religion made him a ftrenuous promoter of the match between the Eledlor Palatine and the Princefs Elizabeth 5 which was ac¬ cordingly concluded and folemnized the 14th of Fe¬ bruary 1612, the archbilhop performing the ceremony on a llage erected in the royal chapel. In the follow¬ ing year happened the famous cafe of divorce between the lady Frances Howard, daughter of the earl of Suf¬ folk, and Robert carl of Effex’, which has been confi- dered as one of the greateft blemilhes of King fames’s reign. The part which the archbifliop took in the hu- linefs, added much to the reputation he had already acquired for incorruptible integrity. It was referred by the king to a court of delegates, wfliofe opinion the king and court wiflied and expelled to be favourable to the divorce. But the archbifhop, unawed by roval authority, with inflexible firmnefs refilled it, and pub- liflied his reafons for perfifting in bis opinion, to which the king, difappointed in his views, thought fit to re¬ ply : Sentence was given in the lady’s favour. In 1618, the king publilhed a declaration, which he or¬ dered to be read in all churches, permitting fports and pailimes on the Lord’s day : this gave great uneafinefs to the archbilhop j who, happening to be at Croydon on the day it was ordered to be read, had the courage to forbid it",Palatine,US,4,United States,North America

"Hitherto Abelard has appeared with high diftinc- tion, as an able difputant, and a popular preceptor : we mult now view him under a difterent character, and, when nearly arrived at the fober age of forty, fee him, on a hidden, exchanging the fchool of philo¬ fophy for the bower of pleafure, and even difgracing himfelf, as will too plainly appear in the fequel, by forming and executing a deliberate plan for the feduc- tion of female innocence. It happened that there wa§ at this time, refident in Paris, Heloife, the niece of Fulbert, one of the canons of the cathedral church, a lady about eighteen years of age, of great perfonal beauty, and highly celebrated for her literary attain¬ ments.

The early and unlimited aflent given “ to teftimony by children gradually contracts as they “ advance in life : it is, therefore, more confonant to “ truth to fay, that our diffidence in teftimony is the “ refult of experience, than that our faith in it has this “ foundation. Befides, the uniformity of experience, “ in favour of any faft, is not a proof againft its be- “ ing reverfed in a particular inftauce. The evidence “ arifing from the fingle teftimony of a man of know;n “ veracity will go farther to eftabliffi a belief in its be- “ ing actually reverfed : If his teftimony be confirmed “ by a few others of the fame charafter, w'e cannot “ withhold our affent to the truth of it.

"Of this we have the following account, which is looked upon by the bed hidorians to be authentic.

The Roman forces having about this time been drawn out of E- gypt, in order to invade Arabia, Candace queen of E- thiopia, or perhaps rather of the ifland or peninfula of Pvleroe, took the opportunity of their abfence to make an irruption, with a numerous army, into the province of Thebais. As there was at that time no force to oppofe her, fhe met for fome time with great fucccfs; but hearing at lad that Petronius, governor of Egypt, was in full march to attack her, die retired into her own dominions. Petronius purfued her as far as Pfelcha, where with 10,000 men he gained an eafy vi&ory OA'er 30,000 undifciplined Ethiopian favages, armed only with poles, hatchets, and other clumfy or infignificant weapons of a fimilar nature. This vic¬ tory was foon followed by the reduftion of feveral fortreffes ; however, as the Roman foldiers were ex- ceffively incommoded by the heat of the climate, Pe- .i-fonius, notwithftarxling his fuccefs, was obliged at [ 56 ] A B Y lad to retire.

Though the affairs of the empire were at prefent in fuch a Hate as required a very pru¬ dent and active adminiftration, the emprefs Helena, widow of Baeda hlariam, had interefl: enough to get the crown fettled on the infant juft mentioned.

But though this might not have been attended with any very bad con- fequence had the two nations been left to decide the quarrel by themfelves, the face of affairs was now quite changed by the interference of the Turks. That peo¬ ple having now conquered almoft the whole of Arabia to the Indian ocean, being likewife on the point of re¬ ducing Egypt, and having a great advantage over their adverfaries in ufing fire-arms, now projected the con- queft of India alfo.

In attempting to fupprefs this rebel¬ lion, the firft attempts of the emperor wTere likewife in- effeftual, his forces being attacked by furprife and en¬ tirely defeated. Soon after this, Ifaac proclaimed Tafcar the nephew of Menas, who was then at liberty, king of Abyflinia 3 hoping thereby to ftrengthen his caufe, and enable him to cope with the emperor, who was affembling a powerful army againft him.

Befides this, Ifaac ftrengthened himfelf alfo by an alliance with the Portuguefe 3 which, had their numbers been at all confiderable, muft have been very formidable. Their inclination to defert their form¬ er protedlor and ally the emperor, proceeded entirely from the (hameful behaviour of their priefts, who never wrould be fatisfied without enflaving the emperor as well as his fubjedts to the tyranny of Rome.

This requifition was made with fuch an air of infolence, that the prince could fcarce conceal his refentment 3 but reftraining his paffion, he promifed to confider of it, and to call meetings of the learned in thefe matters to debate the point.

The others returned to Rome j where, finding that they could not re-efta- blifli themfelves by fair means, they had recourfe to artifice and fidlion.

"ACADEMICS, or Academists, a denomination given to the cultivators of a fpecies of philofophy ori¬ ginally derived from Socrates, and afterwards iilu- ftrated and enforced by Plato, who taught in a grove near Athens, confecrated to the memory of Academus, an Athenian hero 3 from which circumllance this phi¬ lofophy received the name of Academical. Before the days of Plato, philofophy had in a great meafure fal¬ len into contempt. The contradictory fyftems and hy- pothefes which had fucceflively been urged upon the ■world were become lo numerous, that, from a view of this inconftancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehenfion. Abfolute and univerfal fcepticiim was the natural confequence of this conclu- fion. In order to remedy this abufe of philofophy and of the human faculties, Plato laid hold of the / principles of the academical philofophy 3 and, in his Phcedo, reafons in the following manner : “ If we are “ unable to difeover truth (fays he), it muft be owing “ to two circumfiances : either there is no truth in “ the nature of things 3 or the mind, from a defecl “ in its powers, is not able to apprehend it. Upon the “ latter fuppofition, all the uncertainty and fluctuation “ in the opinions and judgments of mankind admit of “ an eafy folution : Let us therefore be model!, and “ aferibe our errors to the real weaknefs of our own “ minds, and not to the nature of things themfelves","Plato, Athens, Plato, Plato","CO,US",4,"Colombia,United States","South America,North America"
"A philofopher, polTeffed of thefe principles, will be flow in his progrefs 3 but will feldom fall into errors, or have occafion to alter his opinion alter it is once formed. Vanity and precipitance are the great fources of fcepticifm : hurried on by thefe, inftead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, feveral of our modern philofophers have plunged themfelves into an abfurd and ridiculous kind of fcepticifm. They pretend to diferedit fubjecls that A C A Academy, are plain, Ample, and eafily compreliended : but give w peremptory and deciAve judgments upon things that evidently exceed the limits of our capacity. Of thefe, Berkeley and Hume are the mod confiderable. Berke¬ ley denied the exiftence of every thing, excepting his own ideas.

In his effay on the academical or fceptical philofophy, he has confounded two very oppoftte fpecies of philofophy. After the days of Plato, indeed, the principles of the firlt aca¬ demy were grofsly corrupted by Arceftlas, Carneades, &c. This might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the academical and fceptical philofophy were fynony- mous terms.

Dr Hal¬ ley was the firlt who made this difcovery 5 and he was led to it by comparing the ancient eclipfes obferved at Babylon with thofe obferved by Albatennius in the .ninth century, and fome of his own time. He was not able to afcertain the quantity of this acceleration, becaufe .the longitudes of Bagdad, Alexandria, and Aleppo, where the obfervations were made, had not been accurately determined.

From thefe data, Mr Dunthorn compared feveral ancient and modern eclip¬ fes, with the calculations of them, by his own tables, and hereby verified Dr Halley’s opinion for he found that the fame tables reprefent the moon’s place more backward than her true place in ancient eclipfes, and more forward than her true place in later eclipfes j and thence juftly inferred, that her motion in ancient times was flower, in later times quicker, than the tables give it. But he did not content himfelf with merely afcertaining the fad! ; he proceeded to determine the quantity of the acceleratioh ; and by means of the molt ancient eclipfe of which any authentic account remains, obferved at Babylon in the year before Chrift 721, he concluded, that the obferved beginning of this eclipfe was not above an hour and three quarters before the beginning by the tables j and therefore the moon’s true place could precede her place by computation but little more than 50' of a degree at that time.

He alfo fhows from feveral ancient grammarians, that the man¬ ner of writing the (jreek accents in thefe days was quite different from that which appears in our books. The author of La Mcthode Greque, p. 546, obferves, that the right pronunciation of the Greek language being natu¬ ral to the Greeks, it was needlefs for them to mark it by accents in their writings : fo that, according to all ap¬ pearance, they only began to make ufe of them about the time when the Romans, wiihing to learn the Greek tongue, fent their children to ftudy at Athens, thinking thereby to fix the pronunciation, and to facilitate it to ftrangers; which happened, as the fame author obferves, a little before Cicero’s time. Wetftein, Greek profeffor at Bafil, in a learned differtation, en¬ deavours to prove the Greek accents of an older Hand¬ ing.

"This is certainly the cafe (how juftly we do not fay) with the philofopher. On the other hand, the words fmell, found, and perhaps tafte, are conceived by moil perfons as exprefhng the immediate objects ot the fenfes of fmelling, hearing, and tailing. Smell and found are haftily conceived as feparate exiftences, and as mediums of information and of intercourfe with the odoriferous and founding bodies ; and it is only the very cautious philofopher who diltinguilhes between the fmell which he feels and the perfume which fills the room. Thofe of the ancients, therefore, who taught that founds were beings wafted through the air, and felt by our ears, ihould not, even at this day, be confidered as awkward obfervers of nature. It has required the long, patient, and fagacious confideration of the molt penetrating ge- niufes, from Zeno the Stoic to Sir Ifaac Newton, to difeover that what we call found, the immediate exter¬ nal object of the fenfe of hearing, is nothing but a par¬ ticular agitation of the parts of furrounding bodies, a£t- 'ing by mechanical impulfe on our organs j and that it is not any feparate being, nor even a fpecific quality inherent in any particular thing, by wdiich it can af- fe6t the organ, as we fuppofe with refpeft to a perfume, but merely a mode of exiltence competent to every atom of matter. And thus the defeription which we propofed to give of found mult be a defeription of that Hate of external contiguous matter which is the caufe of found. It is not therefore prefatory to any theory or fet of doctrines on this fubjedt 5 but, on the contra¬ ry, is the fum or refult of them all",Newton,US,4,United States,North America
"It is Hill more important in another view : it has en¬ couraged us to make fimilar attempts in other cafes, and has fupplied us with a fad! to which an ingenious mind can eafily fancy fomething analogous in many ab- flrufe operations of nature, and thus it enables us- to give fome fort of explanation of them. Accordingly this ufe has been moft liberally made of the mechanical theory of found ; and there is now fcarcely any pheno¬ menon, either of matter or mind, that has not been explained in a manner fomewdrat fimilar. But we are forry to fay that thefe explanations have done no credit to philofophy. They are, for the moft part, ftrongly marked with that precipitate and felf-conceited impa¬ tience wftiich has always charadlerized the inveftigations condudled folely by ingenious fancy. The ccnfe- quences of this procedure have been no lefs fatal to the progrefs of true knowdedge in modem times than in the fchools of ancient Greece j and the ethereal philofophers cf this age, like the followers of Ariftotle of old, have filled ponderous volumes with nonfenfe s t 1 c s. 143 and error. It is ftrange, however, that this ihould be Pu-liminary the effedt of a great and a fuccefsful ftep in philofophy : h^a_ But the fault is in the philofophers, not in the fcience.. _ j Nothing can be mere certain than the account which Newton has given of the propagation of a certain clafs of undulations in an elaftic fluid. But this procedure of nature cannot be feen with diftindfnefs and precifion by any but well-informed mathematicians. They alone can reft with unftiaken confidence on the conclufions legitimately deduced from the Newtonian theorems } and even they can infure fucceis only by treading with the moft fcrupulous caution the fteps of this patient philofopher. But few have done this \ and wTe may venture to fay, that not one in ten cf thofe ivlio em¬ ploy the Newtonian dodtrines of elaftic undulations ror the explanation of other phenomena have taken the trouble, or indeed were able, to go through the fteps of the fundamental propofition (Prin. II. 50, &c.) But the general refults are lo plain, and admit of fuch nn- preflive illuftration, that they draw the affent of the moft carelefs reader ; and all imagine that they under- ftand the explanation, and perceive the whole proce¬ dure of nature. Emboldened therefore by this fuc¬ cefsful ftep in philofophy, they, without heiitation, fancy fimilar intermediums in other cafes \ and as air has been found to be a vehicle for found, they have fuppofed that fomething which they call ether, fome- how refembling air, is the vehicle of viiion. Others have proceeded farther, and have held that ether, or another fomething like air, is the vehicle of fenfaticn in general, from the organ to the brain : nay, we have got a great volume called A Theory of Man, where all our fenfations, emotions, affedhons, thoughts, and purpofes or volitions, are faid to be fo many vibrations of another fomething equally unfeen, gratuitous, and incompetent •, and, to crown all, this exalted dodlrine, w7hen logically profecuted, muft terminate in the dif- covery of thofe vibrations which pervade all others, and which conftitute wdiat we have been accuftomed to venerate by the name Deity. Such muf be the ter¬ mination of this philofophy j and a truly philofophical differtation on the attributes of the Divine Being can be nothing elfe than an accurate defeription or thefe vi¬ brations ! This is not a needlefs and declamatory rbapfody. If the explanation of found can be legitimately transferred to thofe other claftes of phenomena, thefe are certain refults 5 and if fo, all the difeoveries made by New ton are but the glimmerings cf the morning, when compar-- ed with this meridian fplendour. But if, on the other hand, found logic forbids us to make this transference of explanation, we muft continue to believe, fora little while longer, that mind is fomething different from vi¬ brating matter, and that no kind of olcillations will con¬ ftitute infinite wifdom","Newton, Man","GR,US,CI",4,"Greece,United States,Côte d'Ivoire","Europe,North America,Africa"

"Newton was of the firft opinion. He has explained the progreflion of found by an undulatory, or rather a vermicular, motion in the parts of the air. If we have an exaft idea of the crawling of fome infefis, we fliall have a tolerable notion of the progrefuon of found upon Newton’s theory, S T I C S.  !47 this hypothefis. The for inflan.ee, in its motion, firft carries its contraftions from the hinder pan., m or- goun^< der to throw its fore part to the proper diftance, then it carries its contra&ions from the fore part to the hin¬ der to bring that forward. Something fimilar to this is the motion of the air when ftruck upon by a found¬ ing body. To be a little more prqcife, fuppofe ABC, Pfatc I. fig. x. the firing of a harpfichord ferewed to a proper pitch, and drawn out of the right line by tnc finger at B. We fhall have occafion elfewhere to ob- ferve, that fiich a firing would, if let go, vibrate to T* and from E to D, and back again •, that it would con¬ tinue thus to vibrate like a pendulum, lor ever, it.not externally refifted, and like a pendulum,, all its InUe vibrations would be perforfhed in equal times, the lafl and the firft being equally long in performing ; alio that, like a pendulum, its greateft fwiftnefs would, al¬ ways be when it arrived at E, the middle part of its motion. Now then, if this firing be fuppofed to fly from the finger at B, it is obvious, that whatever be its owm motion, fuch alfo will be the motion of. the parts'of air that fly before it. Its motion, as is obvious, is firft uniformly accelerated forward from B to E, then retarded as it goes from E to D, accelerated back again as it returns from D to E, and retarded from Ji","Newton, Newton",US,4,United States,North America
"to B. Thil motion being therefore fucceffively pro¬ duced through a range of elaftic air, it muft happen, that the parts of one range of air will be fent forward with accelerated motion, and. then with a retarded mo¬ tion. This accelerated motion reaching the remotefl end of the firft range will be communicated to a fecov.d range, while the neareft parts of the firft range being retardeddn their motion, and falling back with the re- ceflion of the firing, retire firft with an acceleratea, then with a retarded motion, and the remoteft paits will foon follow. In the mean time, while the parts of the firft range are thus falling back, the parts or tbe fecond range are goh^g forward with an accelerated motion. Thus there will be an alternate condenfation and relaxation of the air, during the time of one vibra¬ tion ; and as the air going forw ard ftrikes any oppofmg body with greater force than uponvretiring, fo each oi thefe accelerated progreffions have been called by New¬ ton a pulfe of found. _ Thus will the air be driven forward m the direction of the firing. But now we muft obferve, that theie pulfes will move every wray 3 for all motion imp re Red upon fluids in any 'direction whatfoever, operates ad around in a fphere : fo that founds will be driven in a 1 direftions, backwards, forwards, upwards, downwards, and on every fide. They will go on fuc.ceediqg eacn other, one on the outfide of the other, like circles ni difturbed water 3 or rather, they will lie one without the other, in concentric fliells, fhell above fuel., as v.e fee in the coats of an onion. . . * All who have remarked the tone 01 a bed, vhreits founds are decaying awray, muft have an idea o. l e pulfes of found, which according to Newton, are mrm> ed by the air’s alternate progreftion and receflion. And it muft be obferved, that as each of thefe pulfes is formed by a ftngle vibration of the firing they muft be equal to each other 3 for the vibrations of the firing are knowm to be fo. ^ ",Newton,US,4,United States,North America

John Bernouilli, Newton’s greateft difciple, modeftly owns that he did not pretend to underftand this part of the Pnncipia. He attempted therefore to give a more perfpicuous demonftration of his own, that might confirm and illuftratb the Newtonian theory.

"Eefides this, however, other circumftances concur to produce different degrees of gravity or acutenefs in founds. The found of a table ftruck upon wuth a piece of wood, wall not be the fame with that produced from a plate of iron ftruck by the fame piece of -wood, even if the blows ftiould be exaflly equal, and the iron per¬ fectly kept from vibrating.

Charlemagne rewarded his attachment, by march¬ ing with a great army to his aid ; and having gained many confiderable advantages over Defiderius, he vi- fited the pope at Rome, and exprefied his piety, by the humiliating ceremony of killing each of the Heps, as he afcended to the church of St Peter.

The pontiff readily acquiefced in her propofal for calling a council, and commiffioned two legates to attend it. The firft council, however, was difperfed by an infurreftion of the citizens, but at the next meeting in the city of Nice, in 787, which was protefted by a military force, a decree was paffed for refloring the worlhip of images. Adrian approved the decree, but in the weftern church it was deemed heretical and dangerous. Charlemagne condemned the innovation, and the French and Englilh clergy con¬ curred in oppoling it. A treatife, containing 120 heads of refutation, was circulated, as the work of Charlemagne, under the title of “ The Caroline Books,” in oppofition to the decree of the council. This work was prefented to the pope by the king’s ambaffador, and the pope wrote a letter to Charlemagne by way of reply. The king, and alfo the Gallican and Englilh churches, retained their fentiments ; and, in 794, a council was held at Frankfort on the Maine, conliliing of about 300 weftern bifhops, by which every kind of Image-worlhip was condemned.

This may be looked upon as a proof of their falubrity as a food ; and it certainly can be no detriment to a farmer to be fo much ver- fant in medical matters, as to know the impropriety of giving putrefeent food to his cattle.

There is a great difproportion, it mutt be owned, between the bulk of an c-x and that of a hog; but we can ficarce think that an ox will eat as much at a time as ten hogs.

After a variety of experiments and obfervations, howrever, he thought he difcovered, that thefe apparent eggs are in truth the heads or fruit of very fine threads fixed on the ear of corn ; that thefe threads or Hems are exceedingly fine and tranfparent, which gives the appearance of eggs to their outrvard extremities.

The celebrated land made writer upon agriculture, Dr James Anderfon of Aber- wet by & Y v 2 deen,fPnnS5- 356 A G R I C U preparation deen, in his “ EiTays on Agriculture and Rural Affairs,” .of JLan(1, publidied m 1775, was undoubtedly the firft perron - "" who explained to the world the nature of the art of draining land rendered wet by fprings, and the princi¬ ples upon which it ought to proceed ; having been led to the inveftigation many years before, by his having fortunately lucceeded in draining a bog by finking a pit in it through the clay till an opening was made in¬ to the gravel or porous llratum, from which the water rufhed up vehemently. In the mean while, it had hap¬ pened that Mr Jofeph Elkington, poffeffcr of a farm in England called Princethorp, in the pariili of Stret- ton upon Dunfmore, and county of Warwick, almoft as early as Dr Anderfon, had accidentally difcovered that land might be drained in many fituations by making a fmali hole into the earth Being a man of confrderable natural ingenuity, though, it is laid, of little literature, he had the addrefs to take advantage of the difcovery he had made, with a view to the improvement of his affairs",Warwick,US,4,United States,North America
"drained, but becaufe the fuperabundance of moidure is apt to introduce and to keep up among the flock that dedruClive and incurable difeafe, the rot, for which draining is an almod infallible preventive. It is cheaply executed in fuch fituations, becaufe the drains for collecting and leading off the water, may ufually be left uncovered. Let it be fuppofed then, that in confequence of internal fprings at a certain didance down the declivity of a hill, or upon any other de- feending furface, the ground becomes w^et and fpouty, and unwffiolefome for ffieep, and unfit for agriculture 5 the bed mode of proceeding with a view to drain it is this. It ought to be recolle&ed, that the reafon of the wetnefs is this : The rain water at the fummit of the ground is received into a porous dratum of gra¬ vel, with which it defeends down the fide of the hill, till it comes to be covered with a clayey foil. After defeending under the covering of clay to fome didance, the gravel or porous under foil fuddenly ceafes; the clay becomes deeper, and touches the rock or another in¬ ferior bed of clay. In this fituation, the w^ater, unable to defeend farther, regorges and preffes upwards upon the clayey foil which covers it, rendering it moid and fwampy in every part, and oozing through all its- weaker crannies. Thus it forms a belt of moid ground along the face of the hill, from which the water perhaps defeends and damages every part. To drain this de¬ clivity, begin at the bottom and carry up a ditch to¬ wards the w^et ground. As the objeff is to let out the water at the lowed point of the refervoir or natural bag in which it is contained, by making an opening into the gravel there, it will be proper, as the ditch proceeds upwards, frequently to bore holes with an auger of about two inches diameter to a confiderable depth, Parti. A G R I C U Preparation depth, that is, about 15 feet, though fometimes it is of Land. neceffary to go to twice that depth. As long as the V..—y—water is not found by boring, the ditch mull be car¬ ried upwards, and new auger holes formed 5 when at laft the auger by boring reaches the lowed part of the gravel or refervoir of water, the water will immediate¬ ly ruih forth with considerable violence at tne hole formed by it, and will continue ever after to run with¬ out any danger of choking up. W hen the bottom of the refervoir of water or layer of gravel is thus found, another ditch ought to be drawn acrofs the head of the former along the face of the hill, fo as to form the figure of the letter 1.

In that part of the country, fuch of the wafte lands, as are capable of being drained fo as to become arablej have, at the diftance of irom one to fix feet below the Surface, a large ftratum or feam '©f a black flaty or metallic fubftance, generally from 20 to 25 feet in thicknefs. Below this is a layer of whinftone rock of unknown depth. The black llaty or metallic fubftance has no chinks or fiflures, and is impenetrable to water •, but the whinftone rock beneath it abounds with chinks and fiflures, and will fwallow up any quantity of water poured into its bofomi The uppermoft furface of the foil is of a light mofly nature, upon which the water ftagnates in winter, fo as to fwell and enlarge it to a confiderable degree. In the Spring months, when dried by the fun and the wind, the mofs becomes tolerably firm, and produces a coarfe unpro¬ fitable grafs, mixed with ftiort heather j neither of ■which are of any value as food for Iheep or cattle. In the year 1784 the waiter of the Report ploughed up 20 acres of the wafte lands of the above defcription, a part of them being fituated on a level. This laft part was gathered in fmall ridges, and ploughed pretty deep, and the ftones removed. Thus it lay till midfummer 1785 ; but, during the Spring, the (heep and cattle were frequently driven upon it to tread it to a firm con- fiftence. At midfummer it wras gathered up again; and, to get the w^ater out of the hollow’s of the ridges, a pair of boring rods ware obtained, w’hich w'ere put down through the flaty fubftance to the whinftone rock at Sundry places.

A remarkable circumftance refpefting this grain is, that though upon its introduction into the county the cojk or hulk be perfectly white, yet fuch is the power either of the foil or of the mode of cultivation to produce what the botanifts call varieties, that the grain in queftion is faid to lofe every year fomewhat of the whitenefs of its hulks, until they become at lall equally red with thofe of the former kind. The fonthern and fouth-eaftern parts of the county general¬ ly enjoy a ftronger and richer foil than the more north¬ erly, and therefore are more proper for the cultivation of that fpecies of grain. In the northern parts are fome farms of very light foil, where the farmers fow only Fart L A G R I C U Culture of only a fmall quantity of wheat j and thefe light lands particular are calleci barley farms","Norfolk, Norfolk",US,4,United States,North America

Tke greateft part of the wheat in Norfolk is fown upon a fecond year’s ley j fometimes it is fown upon Succeffion a firft year’s ley } fometimes on a fummer fallow } af- of crops, ter peas, turnips, or buck harvefted or ploughed un- der. The pra£lice adopted by thofe who are^looked upon as fuperior hulbandmen in the county of Norfolk is as follows: The fecond year’s leys having finifhed the bullocks, and brought the flock cattle and horfes through the fore part of futnmer, and the firft year s leys having been made ready to receive his dock, the farmer begins to break up his old land or ley ground Rice-balk- by a peculiar mode of cultivation named rice-balking^ ing, a parti- in which the furrow is always turned toward the un- cular mode piou„hed ground, the edge of the coulter paffing al- of c,ultuI7’ ways clofe by the edge of the flag lad turned. This CXP is done at firfl: with an even regular furrow *, opportu¬ nity being taken for performing the operation after the furface has been moiftened by a fummer fhower. In this date his fummer leys remain until towards the end of harved, when he harrows and afterwards ploughs them acrofs the balks of the former ploughing, bring¬ ing them now up to the full depth of the foil. On this ploughing he immediately harrows the manure, and ploughs it in with a fhallow furrow. The effefts of this third ploughing are to mix and effectually pul¬ verize the foil and manure 5 to cut oft and pulverize the upper furfaces of the furrows of the fecond ploughing*, and thus, in the mod effectual manner, to eradicate or fmother the weeds which had elcaped the two former ones. Thus it lies until the feed time, when it is har¬ rowed, rolled, fown, and gathered up into ridges of fuch width as the farmer thinks mod proper. Thofe oft fix furrows are mod common, though^ fome very good farmers lay their wheat land into four furron, and others into ten furrow ridges *, “ which lad. (fays out author) they execute^in a dyle much fuperior to what might be expe&ed from wheel ploughs.” They excel, however, in the fix-furrow ploughing j of which Mr Marfhal gives a particular achount. When plough¬ ing in this manner, they carry Very narrow furrows •, fo that a fix-furrow ridge, fet out by letting the off- horfe return in the fird-made furrow, does not meafure more than three feet eight or nine inches","Norfolk, Norfolk",US,4,United States,North America
"It is likewife a favourite practice with the Norfolk farmers to raife wheat alter buck ploughed under. I hey plough under the buck by means of a uroom made rough bullies fixed to the fore tackle ot the plough be¬ tween the wheels, which bears down the plant with¬ out lifting the wheels from the ground. . Sometimes, when the buck is ftrong, they firft break it dowm with a roller going the fame way that the plough is intend¬ ed to go ; afterwards a good ploughman wall coyer it fo effeclually that fcarce a ftalk.can be feen. Some¬ times the furface of the ground is.left rough, but it iS more eligible to harrow and roll it. I he practice o- fummer fallowing feldom occurs in Norfolk ) though fometimes, when the foil has been much worn down by cropping, and overrun by weeds, it is efteemed a ju¬ dicious praflice by many excellent hulbandmen, and the praftice feems to be daily gaining ground. Alter turnips the foil is ploughed to a moderate depth, and the feed fown over the (irft ploughing : but if the tur¬ nips be got in early, the weeds are fometimes firft ploughed in with a (hallow furrow, and the feed plough¬ ed under with a fecond ploughing, gathering the (oil into narrow7 ridges* 234 With regard to the manuring of the ground for Manuring wheat in Norfolk, thatw'hich has been recently clayed or marled is fuppofed to need no other preparation any more than that which has received 15 °r 2C loads of dung and mould for turnips j the firft yea* s ley having been teathed in autumn, and the fecond fed off.

Ploughing in the feed under furrow is the favourite mode of the Norfolk far¬ mers, and is performed in the following manner: “ The land having been harrowed down level, and the furface rendered fmooth by the roller, the head plough¬ man (if at leifure) marks out the whole piece in nar¬ row flips of about a flatute rood in width. This he does by hanging up the plough in fuch a manner, that no part of it except the heel touches the ground ; and tills makes a fure mark for the feedfman, which he cannot by any means miflake.

"Notwithflanding the advantages of laving feed, as well as feme others which are generally reckoned undeni¬ able, it is here afferted by feme very judicious farmeis, that dibbling of wheat on the whole is not really a pro¬ fitable prattice.

In the midland difirifl, including part of Staffordfhire, Derbyfhire, Warwick, and Leicefter- a fhire, we are informed that the fpecies ufually fown is that called Red Lemmas, the ordinary red wheat of the kingdom: but of late a fpecies named the Ejjcx dun, fimilar to the Kentifh white cojl) of Norfolk, and tivzllertfordjhire brown oi'SioxV.hinz, has been coming into vogue. Cone-wheat, formerly in ufe in this di- ftrift, is now out of fafhion. Spring wheat is cultiva¬ ted with remarkable fuccefs, owing principally to the time of fowing •, vi%. the dole of April. Our author was informed by an excellent farmer in thefe parts, that by fowing early, as in the beginning of March, the grain was liable to be ihrivelled, and the ftraw to be blighted ; while that which was fown towards the end of April, or even in the beginning of May, pro¬ duced clean plump corn. At the time he vifited this county, however, it feemed to be falling into difre- pute ; though he looks upon it, in feme fituations, efpecially in a turnip country, to be eligible. In the ordinary fucceffion in this part of the kingdom, wheat comes after oats} and there is perhaps nine-tenths of the wheat in this diftrifl fown upon oat-ftubble.

"AS winter-ploughing enters into the culture of oats, froft^pon we mud remind the reader of the effect of frod upon •tilled land, tilled land.

But upon wet eartn it a£ts mod vigo- roufly } it expands the moidure, which requiring more fpace puts every particle of the earth out of its place, and feparates them from each other. In that view, frod may be confidered as a plough fuperior to any that is made, or can be made, by the hand of man : its action reaches the minuted particles j and, by di¬ viding and feparating them, it renders the foil loofe and friable. This operation is the mod remarkable in tilled land, which gives free accefs to frod. With re- fpeft to clay foil in particular, there is no rule m huf¬ bandry more effential than to open it before winter in hopes of frod. It is even advifable m a clay foil to leave the dubble rank ; which, when ploughed m be- fore winter, keeps the clay loofe, and admits the froit into every cranny",Providence,US,4,United States,North America
