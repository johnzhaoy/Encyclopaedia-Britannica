It lies 60 miles to the weft of Hifpaniola, 25 leagues north of Jamaica, 100 miles to the eaft of Ju- catanj and as many to the fouth of Cape Florida ; and commands the entrance of the gulfs both of Mexi¬ co and Florida, as alfo the Avindward paffages. By this fituation it may be called the key of the Weft In¬ dies. It Avas difcovcred by Columbus in T492, who gave it the name of Ferdinando, in honour of King Ferdinand of Spain ; but it quickly after recovered its ancient name of Cuba. The natives did not regard Columbus with a \rery favourable eye at his landing ; and the weather proving very tempeftuous, he foon * left this ifiand, and failed to Hayti, noAv called Hifpa¬ niola, Aihere he Avas better received. The Spaniards, however, foon became mafters of it. By the year 1511 it was totally conquered ; and in that time they had deftroyed, according to their own accounts, feve¬ ral millions of people. But the poffeflion of Cuba was far from anfwering the expectations of the Spanifii adventurers, whofe avarice could be fatiated Avith nothing but gold. Thefe monfters, finding that there Avas gold upon the illand, concluded that it muft come from mines; and therefore tortured the few inhabi¬ tants they had left, in order to extort from tl a dif- covery of the places were thefe mines lay. ihe mi- feries endured by thefe poor creatures were fuch that they almoft unanimoufly refdlved to put an end to their own lives ; but were prevented by one of the Spanilh’ tyrants called Vafco Povccllos. This Avretch threaten¬ ed to hang himfelf along Avith them, that he might have the pleafure, as he faid, of tormenting them in the next Avorkl worfe than he had done in this; and fo much were they afraid of the Spaniards, that this A threat CUB [2 Cuba, threat diverted thefe poor favages from their defperate 1 _ refolution. In 1511, the town of Havannah was built, now the principal place on the illand. The houfes were at firft built only of wood j and the town itfelf was for a long time fo inconliderable, that in 1536 it wa# taken by a French pirate, who obliged the inha¬ bitants to pay yco ducats to lave it from being burnt","Florida, Columbus, Columbus","CU,US,JM,ES,UY,FR",5,"Cuba,United States,Jamaica,Spain,Uruguay,France","North America,North America,North America,Europe,South America,Europe"

"This cultivation of coffee naturally leads to that of fugar ; and this, which is the moft valuable produc¬ tion of America, would of itfelf be fufficient to give Cuba that ftate of profperity for which it feems de- figned by nature. Although the furface of the illand is in general uneven and mountainous, yet it has plains fufficiently extenfive, and well enough watered, to fup- ply the confumption of the greateft part of Europe with fugar. The incredible fertility of its new lands, if properly managed, w ould enable it to furpafs every other nation, however they may have now got the Hart of it : yet fueh is the indolence of the Spaniards, that to this day they have but few plantations, where,, with the fineft canes, they make but a fmall quantity • of coarfe fugar at a great expence. This ferves partly for the Mexican market, and partly for the mother- country j while the indolent inhabitants are content to import fugar for themfelves at the expence of near 220,cocl. annually. It has been expedted with pro¬ bability, that the tobacco imported from Cuba w ould compenfate this lofs; for after furnilhing Mexico and Peru, there was fufficient, with the little brought from Caracca and Buenos Ayres, to fupply all Spain. But this trade too has declined through the negligence of the court of Madrid, in not gratifying the general tafte for tobacco from the Havannah. The Spaniffi colonies have an univerfal trade in fkins ; and Cuba iiipplies ymually about 10 or 12 thoufand. The num¬ ber might eaftly be increafed in a country abounding with wild cattle, where feme gentlemen poffefs large trafts of ground, that for want of population can fcarce be applied to any other purpofe than that of breeding cattle. The hundredth part of this Bland is not yet cleared. The true plantations are all confined to the beautiful plains of the Havannah, and even thofe are not what they might be. AH thefe plantations ] CUB together may employ about 25,000 male and female Cuba flaves. The number of whites, meftees, mulattoes, l! and free negroes, upon the whole ifland, amounts to ,<""u^c'!(‘cr~j about 30,000. The food of thefe different fpecies con- fifts of excellent pork, very bad beef, and caffava bread. The colony would be more flourilhing, if its produdlions had not been made the property of a com¬ pany, whofe exclufive privilege operates as a conftant and invariable principle of difcouragement. If any thing could lupply the want of an open trade, and a- tone for the grievances occafioned by this monopoly at Cuba, it would be the advantage which this illand has for fuch a long time enjoyed, in being the rendezvous of almoft all the Spaniih veffels that fail to the new world.

In 1678 he publilhed his True Intelle<5tual Syftem of the Univerfe 5 a work .which met with great oppofition.

"The Cynic philofophers owe their origin and infti- tution to Antifthe.nes of Athens, a difcipie of Socrates ; who being allied of what ufe his philofophy had been to him, replied, “ It enables me to live with myfelf.” Diogenes was the moft famous of his difciples, in whofe life the fyftem of this philofophy appears in its greateft perfeflion. Holed a moft wretched life, a tub having ferved him for a lodging, which he rolled before him wherever he went. Yet he rvas neverthe- lefs not the more humble on account of his ragged cloak, bag, and tub ; for one day entering Plato’s houfe, at a time when there was a fplendid entertain¬ ment there for feveral perfons of diftinftion, he jump¬ ed upon a very rich couch in all his dirt, faying, Cynics “ I trample on the pride of Plato.” “ Yes, (replied || Plato), but with great pride, Diogenes.” He had the Cynpfce- utmoft contempt for all the human race ; for he walked , the ftreets of Athens at noon-day with a lighted lan- thorn in his hand, telling the people, “ He was in fearch of a man.” Among many excellent maxims of morality, he held fome very pernicious opinions : for he ufed to fay that the uninterrupted good fortune of Harpalus, who generally palled for a thief and a robber, was a * teftimony againft the. gods. He re¬ garded chaftity and modefty as weaknefles. Hence Laertius obferves of him, that he did every thing open¬ ly, whether it belonged to Ceres or Venus ; though he adds, that Diogenes only ran to an excefs of impu¬ dence to put others out of conceit of it. But impu¬ dence was the charadteriftic of thefe philofophers; who argued, that what was right to be done, might be done at all times, and in all places. The chief principle of this fedt in common with the Stoics, was, that we ftiould follow nature.

Either of thefe deriva¬ tions agrees with the office aferibed to daemons by the ancient heathens, as the fpirit intruded with the in- fpeftion and government of mankind. For, accor¬ ding to the philofophers, daemons held a middle rank betrveen the celeftial gods, and men on earth, and car¬ ried on all intercourfe between them ; conveying the addreffes of all men to the gods, and the divine benefits to men.

It is then taken out, and dried, and afterwards dyed with an equal weight of madder. I he colour thus obtained is of a dark (hade. Mr Guliche dtfcribes another procefs. For every pound of filk he propofes a bath of four ounces of alum and one ounce of folu¬ tion of tin. When the liquor has become clear, it is decanted, and the filk carefully foaked in it for 12 hours, after which it is to be immerfed in a bath with half a pound of madder foftened by boiling, with an infufion of galls in white wine.

"386. Logwood and Brazil, fuflic and yellow wood, are colouring fubftances which may be fixed with ad¬ vantage upon wool by means of this mordant. The colour communicated by the two firft of thefe is liable to be changed in the fulling by the a£tion of the foap or urine employed for that purpofe ; but this change, which is always produced by alkaline fubftances, is re¬ medied by a (lightly acid bath a little hot, called brightening 1 for which the fulphuric acid has the pre¬ ference. The colour becomes as deep, and frequently much brighter than before the change. Wools which have been dyed by means of this mordant, are faid to admit of being fpun into a finer and more beautiful thread than by the ufe of alum. If the ufe of fulphate of copper is omitted, more beautiful colours are produ¬ ced by fuftic and yellow wood, as well as by weld. An orange red colour is communicated by madder, but not fo deep as with a fimilar quantity of alum. When fulphate of copper is omitted, the wool is faid to be¬ come much harfher, and the mordant thus prepared yields but indifferent colours with logwood, and in par¬ ticular with Brazil wood.

"387. The above procefs is thus explained by Ber- ‘ thollct.

The oxide of copper produces the blue with the colouring particles of the logwood j the violet is formed by the oxide of tin with the fame wood, and the red, with the colouring matter of the Brazil wood. The fame ingenious chemift farther obferves, that as an excefs of acid is retained in the liquor, it might probably be of advantage to employ acetate as a fubftitute for fulphate of copper, in which cafe the a6Hon of the free acid would be moderated. He thinks it would ftill be more advifeable to make ufe of verdigrife j becaufe the uncombined part of the oxide of copper would, in that cafe, unite with the excefs of acid, on which account a fmaller quantity of acid would remain in the liquor •, and probably the quantity of tartar might be diminifti- ed as a fmaller quantity of tin would thus be precipi- Compound* taUjd ** Colom II.

When the fine violet colour is required, the (ilk muft firft be pafled through cochineal, and dipped afterwards in the vat. The preparation and dyeing of the filk with cochineal are the fame as for crimfon, with the omiffion of tartar and folution of tin, by means of which the colour is heightened. The quantity of cochineal made ufe of is always proportioned to the re¬ quired (hade, whether it is more or lefs intenfe j but the ufual proportion for a fine violet colour is two ounces of cochineal for each pound of filk. When the filk is dyed, it is walked at the river, twice beetled, dipped in a vat more or lefs ftrong, in proportion to the depth of the violet fhade, and then walked and dried with precautions fimilar to thofe which all colours require that are dyed in the vat.

If this mode of eflimation be juft, it is irrecon- cileable with the conceflion of thofe, who admit that the velocity is proportional to the force imprefled, in thofe cafes where no previous obfervation can be had of the ratio of the forces, and of its equality to the ratio of the velocities. Such a cafe is the force of gravity, which thefe philofophers alfo meafure by its acce¬ lerating power, or the velocity generated in a given time. This muft be granted j for there are cafes in which the force can be meafured by the actual preflure which it exerts. Thus a fpring fteelyard can be con- ftru&ed, the rod of which is divided by hanging on fucceflively a number of perfe&ly equal weights. In the different ftates of tenfion of the fpring, its elafti- city is proportional to the prelTures of gravity which it balances. If it be found, that at Quito in Peru, a weight will pull out the rod to the mark 312, and that the fame weight at Spitzbergen draws it out to' 313, it Teems to be a fair inference to fay, that the preffure of gravity at Quito is to its preffure at Spitzbergen as 312 to 313 *, and this is affirmed on the authority of effefts being proportional to their caufes.

"To pretend that no advantages may be derived from travelling, becaufe fome of thofe who travel return home without having gained much real improvement, would be highly unreafonable. Young people who have had a bad education, and are fent on their travels without any perfon to direft or fuperintend their condudl, can¬ not be expe&ed to improve by vifiting foreign coun¬ tries. But they whom nature has adorned with vir¬ tuous difpofitions, and who have been fo happy as to re¬ ceive a good education, and go abroad with a real de¬ fire of improvement, cannot but return with an in- creafe of virtue and wifdom. In this manner ftiall E- milius conduct his travels. To induce him to improve in the moft attentive manner that time which he {hould fpend in travelling, I would let him know, that as he had now attained an age in which it might be proper for him to form fome determination with regard to the plan of his future life, he ought therefore to look abroad into the world, to view the various orders in fociety, to obferve the various circumftances of man- -kind under different forms of government, and in different parts of the globe ; and to choofe his country, his ftation, and his profeflion. With thefe views ftiould Emilius fet out on his travels: and with thefe views, in the courfe of our travels, we fhould inquire into the origin of fociety and government, into the nature of thofe principles by means of which men are united in a focial ftate, into the various circumftances which have given rife to fo many different forms of government, and into the neceffary relation between government and manners. Our ftay in the great towns {hould be but fhort: for as in them corruption of manners has rifen to a great height, and diflipation reigns, a long ftay in any great town might be fatal to the virtuous dif¬ pofitions of Emilius. Yet his attachment to Sophia would alone be fufficient to fave him from the dangers to which his virtue is expofed. A young man muft either be in love, or be a debauchee.

"Dr Nicolas, a perfon of eminence in the phyfical world, and a relation of his mafter’s, happened to die.

The reading of thefe books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile bufinefs he might have formerly had, and herefolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he vifited moft of the principal towns in Holland, and in about a month returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was difpofed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the mafter of the ffiip in which he em¬ barked.

However, by obtaining tellimonials of his innocence, a releafe was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year vifited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During his flay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each ; the firft to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720 j the fecond on foot, to Orleans and Blois; but an edidl happening at that time to be iffued for fecuring va¬ grants, in order to tranfport them to America, as the banks of the MifliiTippi wanted population j our au¬ thor narrowly efcaped a weftern voyage. On his ar¬ rival in England, Mr Edwards clofely purfued his fa¬ vourite ftudy of natural hiftory, applying himfelf to drawing and colouring fuch animals as fell under his notice. A ftrift attention to natural, more than pic- tureique beauty, claimed his e.arlieft care : birds firft engaged his particular attention ; and having pur- chaled lome of the beft pictures of thefe fubjedts, he was induced to make a few drawings of bis own j which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalift to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours.

Our artift, thus unexpectedly encouraged, in- creafed in Ikill and afliduity j and procured, by his ap¬ plication to his favourite purfuit, a decent fubfiftence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted hisin- duftry in 1731 ; when, in company with two of his re¬ lations, he made an excurfion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected feveral fcarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original pictures of feveral great maftersat Antwerp, Brufiels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the recommenda¬ tion of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart, prefident of the College of Phyficians, he was chofen librarian, and had apartments in the college.
