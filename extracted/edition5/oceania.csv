"Returning from the plunder of one place, 50 of the party were killed by the Spaniards. This difafler fo difeouraged them that they relinquiflied all farther at¬ tempts on thefe coafts. Swan then prqpofed to run acrofs the Pacific ocean, and return by the Eaft Indies j and in hopes of a fucceisful cruife off the Manillas the crew were perfuaded, with a very (lender provifion, to rilk this long paffage. On the lad day of March 1686, they took their departure from Cape Corrientes, and-on the ^2d day reached Guam, one of the Ladrone iflands. About this time the crew talked of killing and eating Swan and the officers, in cafe their (lock of provifion (hould be exhaufled before it could be fupplied. From Guam they proceeded to Mindanao. While the (hip lay here a mutiny arofe among the crew, and the majority carried her off, Swan and fame of his people being left on the ifland. Among the farmer was Dampier, although it is faid that he had no concern in the mutiny. After cruizing fome time off Manilla, and having careened their veffel at Pulo Condore, in 1687 they were driven to the Chinefe coaft, made the circuit of Luzonia and Mindanao, paffed through the group of Spice iflands, and reached the coaft of New Holland in the beginning of 1688","March, Corrientes","GU,GB,AR",5,"Guam,United Kingdom,Argentina","Oceania,Europe,South America"
"Many feamen and foldiers, vvhofe fervices had been re- fufed, becaufe more had offered themfelves than were needed, were found hid in the (hips, and, when order¬ ed a (bore, clung to the ropes and timbers, imploring to go without reward with their companions. Twelve hundred men failed in five flout (hips, and arrived at Darien in two months, with the lofs of only 15 of their people. At that time it was in their power, moft of whom were well born, and all of them hardily bred and inured to the fatigues and dangers of the late war, to have gone from the northmoft part of Mexico to the fouthmoft of Chili, and to have overturned the whole empire of Spain in the South feas: But modefl, re- fpefling their own and their country’s character, and afraid of being accufed that they had plunder, and not a fettlement in view, they began with purchafing lands from the natives, and fending meffages of amity to the Spanith governors wdthin their reach : and then fixed their ftation at A£!a, calling it New St Andrew^ from the name of the tutelar faint of Scotland, and the country itfelf New Caledonia. One of the fides of the harbour being formed by a long narrow neck of land which ran into the fea, they cat it aerofs fo as to join the ocean and the harbour.

"Dr Darwin, in his character as a poet, does not hand very high in the eftimatlon of feme. The ear is fafeinated and feduced by the mellifluence of his num¬ bers, but there is a harlotry in his embellifliments which is unchafte. His cadences are not fufficiently varied for a poem of fuch length as the “ Botanic Garden indeed there is an evident mechanifm in the conftruCtion of his lines which it is by no means plea- fant to deteft. But an imagination of unrivalled rich- nefsj a felicity of allufion to whatever can throw luftre on his fubjeCt, to ancient mythology and modern dif¬ coveries, to the works of nature and of art ; if thefe are fome of the eflentials of poetry, Dr Darwin may certainly claim them as his own. No man, perhaps, was ever happier in the feleCtion and compofition of his epithets, had a more imperial command of words, or could elucidate with fuch accuracy and elegance the moft complex and intricate machinery. Who but Dr Darwin would have thought of deferibing a porcelain 15 ] DA 11 manufactory in verfe j the powers and conftruCtion of Darwin- a (team engine j the mechanifm of a watch ; and the ——y— complexity of a cotton mill ? Thefe, and many fimilar deferiptions, to be found in the Botanic Garden, are inimitable in their way. In fome of his minor effufions he is particularly happy : the beautiful little fong “ to May,” is exquifitely finiftied ; and it would be difficult to find thirty lines in the Botanic Garden to rival in dignity and pathos the “ Addrefs to Swilcar’s Oak,” introduced in the Phytologia",Darwin,AU,5,Australia,Oceania

If that prodigious ftone in the parifti of Conftantine, Cornwall, was really removed by art from its original place, and fixed where it now (lands (as one of our mod learned and diligent antiquaries thinks it was*),* Dr jj0^, it is a demonftration, that the druids could perform the moft aftoniffiing feats by their flcill in mechanics, That the Britilh druids were acquainted with the'1 ‘74 principles and ufe of the balance, we have good reafon to believe, not only from the great antiquity of that difcovery in other parts of the world, but alfo from fome druidical monuments which are (till remaining in this ifland, Thefe monuments are called Logan Stones, or rocking ftones j and each of them confifts of one prodigious block of ftone, refting upon an upright ftone or rock, and fo equally balanced, that a very fmall force, fometimes even that of a child, can move it up and down, though hardly any force is fufficient to remove it from its ftation.

"In 1675, the earl of Roehefter, whofe envious and malevolent difpofition would not permit him to fee growing merit meet with its due reward, and was therefore fincerely chagrined at the very juft applaufe with which Mr Dryden’s dramatic pieces had been re¬ ceived, wTas determined if poffible to fhake his in- tereft at court; and fucceeded fo far as to recommend iMr Crowne, an author by no means of equal merit, and at that time of an obfcure reputation, to write a malk for the court, which certainly belonged to Mr Dryden’s office as poet laureat.—Nor was this the only attack, nor indeed the moft potent one, that Mr Dry¬ den’s juftly acquired fame drew on him. For, fome years before, the duke of Buckingham, a man of not tnuCh better character than Lord Rochefter, had moft feverely ridiculed feveral of our author’s plays in his admired piece called the Rehearfal. But though the intrinfic wit which runs through that performance can¬ not even to this hour fail of exciting our laughter, yet at the fame time it ought not to be the ftandard on which we ffiould fix Mr Dryden’s poetical reputation, if we confider, that the pieces there ridiculed are not any of thofe looked on as the chef iVceuvres of this au¬ thor ; that the very paffages burlefqued are frequently, in their original places, much lefs ridiculous than when thus detached, like a rotten limb, from the body of the work ; and expofed to view with additional diftor- tions, and divefted of that connexion with the other parts, which, while preferved, gave it not only fymme- try but beauty ; and, laftly, that the various inimitable beauties, which the critic has funk in oblivion, are in¬ finitely more numerous than the deformities which he has thus induftrioufly brought forth to our more im¬ mediate infpeCtion, Mr Dryden, however, did not fuffer thefe attacks to pafs with impunity; for in 1679 there came out an Effay on Satire, faid to be written jointly by that gentleman and the earl of Mulgrave, containing fome very fevere refleftions on the earl of Rochefter and the duchefs of Portfmouth, who, it is not improbable, might be a joint inftrument in the above-mentioned kffront (hown to Mr Dryden; and in 1681 he publiffied his Abfalom and Achitophel, in which the well-known charadfer of Zimri, drawn for the duke of Bucking¬ ham, is certainly fevere enough to repay all the ridi¬ cule thrown on him by that nobleman in the charadter of Bayes.—The refentment fhown by the different peers was very different. Lord Rochefter, who was a coward as well as a man of the moft depraved morals, bafely hired three ruffians to cudgel Dryden in a coffeehoufe: but the duke of Buckingham, as we are told, in a more open manner, took the talk upon himfelf: and at the fame time prefented him with a purfe containing no very trifling fum of money : telling him, that he gave him the beating as a punifhment for his impudence, but bellowed the gold on him as a reward for his wit",Mulgrave,AU,5,Australia,Oceania
