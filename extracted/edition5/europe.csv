The Spaniards, however, foon became mafters of it. By the year 1511 it was totally conquered ; and in that time they had deftroyed, according to their own accounts, feve¬ ral millions of people.

"This cultivation of coffee naturally leads to that of fugar ; and this, which is the moft valuable produc¬ tion of America, would of itfelf be fufficient to give Cuba that ftate of profperity for which it feems de- figned by nature. Although the furface of the illand is in general uneven and mountainous, yet it has plains fufficiently extenfive, and well enough watered, to fup- ply the confumption of the greateft part of Europe with fugar. The incredible fertility of its new lands, if properly managed, w ould enable it to furpafs every other nation, however they may have now got the Hart of it : yet fueh is the indolence of the Spaniards, that to this day they have but few plantations, where,, with the fineft canes, they make but a fmall quantity • of coarfe fugar at a great expence. This ferves partly for the Mexican market, and partly for the mother- country j while the indolent inhabitants are content to import fugar for themfelves at the expence of near 220,cocl. annually. It has been expedted with pro¬ bability, that the tobacco imported from Cuba w ould compenfate this lofs; for after furnilhing Mexico and Peru, there was fufficient, with the little brought from Caracca and Buenos Ayres, to fupply all Spain. But this trade too has declined through the negligence of the court of Madrid, in not gratifying the general tafte for tobacco from the Havannah. The Spaniffi colonies have an univerfal trade in fkins ; and Cuba iiipplies ymually about 10 or 12 thoufand. The num¬ ber might eaftly be increafed in a country abounding with wild cattle, where feme gentlemen poffefs large trafts of ground, that for want of population can fcarce be applied to any other purpofe than that of breeding cattle. The hundredth part of this Bland is not yet cleared. The true plantations are all confined to the beautiful plains of the Havannah, and even thofe are not what they might be.

William, afterwards Doctor Hunter, the famous letfturer on ana¬ tomy in London,,-was a native of the fame part of the country ; and not being in affluent circumftances more than Cullen, thefe two young men, ftimulated by the impulfe of genius to profecute their medical ftudies with ardour, but thwarted by the narrownefs of their fortune, entered into a copartnery bufinefs as furgeons and apothecaries in the country.

"In the fea, currents are either natural and general, as arifing from the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis 3 or accidental and particular, caufed by the waters being driven againft promontories, or into gulfs and ftraits, where, wanting room to fpread, they are driven back, and thus difturb the ordinary flux of the fea. Currents are various, and directed towards different parts of the ocean, of which fowe Z l 7 ] CUR are conflant, others periodical. The moft extraordi¬ nary current of the fea is that by which part of the Atlantic or African ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the curvature or bay of Africa which they call Fernando Poo ; viz. from weft to eaft* contrary to the general motion : and fuch is the force of the current, that when Ihips approach too near the Ihore, it carries them violently towards that bay, and deceives the mariners in their reckoning. There’ is a great variety of ftiifting currents, which do not laft, but return at certain periods : and thefe do, moft of them, depend upon and follow the anniverfary winds or monfoons, which by blowing in one place may caufe a current in another. Varenius informs us, that at Java, in the ftraits of Sunda, when the monfoons blow from the weft, viz. in the month of May, the currents fet to the call ward, contrary to the general motion. Between the ifland of Celebes and Madura, when the weftern monfoons fet in, viz. in December^ January, and February, or when the winds blow from the north-weft, or between the north and weft, the currents fet to the fouth-eaft, or between the foutli and eafl. At Ceylon, from the middle of March to Odfober, the currents let to the fouthward, and in the other parts of the year to the northward : becaufe at this time the fouthern monfoons blow, and' at the other the northern. Between Cochin-China and Ma¬ lacca, when the weftern msnfoons blow, viz. from April to Auguft, the currents fet eaftward againft the general motion 3 but the reft of the year they fet weft ward, the monfoon confpiring with the general motion. They run fo ftrongly in thefe feas, that un¬ experienced failors miftake them for waves that beat upon the rocks, known uiually by the name of break¬ ers. So for fome months after the 15th of February, the currents fet from the Maldives towards India cm the eaft, againft the general motion of the fea. On the ffiore of China and Cambodia, in the months of Odto- ber, November, and December, the currents fet to the north-weft, and from January to the fouth-weft,. whsn they run with fuch rapidity about the ftioals of Parcel, that they feem fwifter than an arrow.. A t Pulo Ccn- dore, upon the coaft of Cambodia, though the mon¬ foons are fhiftmg, yet the currents fet ftrongly to¬ wards the eaft, even when they blow to a contrary point. Along the coafts of the bay of Bengal, as far as the Cape Romania, at the extreme point of Malacca* the current runs fouthward in November and December. When the monfoons blow from China to Malacca, the fea runs fwiftly from Pulo Cambi to Pulo Condore on the coaft of Cambodia. In the bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope, there is a current particularly remarkable, where the ffa runs from eaft to weft to the landward j and this more vehemently, as it is oppofed by winds from a contrary dire&ion. The caufe is undoubtedly owing to fome adjacent ftiore which is higher than this. In the ftraits of Gibraltar the currents almoft conftantly drive to the eaftward, and carry ftiips into the Medi¬ terranean 3 they are alfo found to drive the fame way into St George’s channel","March, Along, Malacca, Malacca","CN,KH,IN,GI,MY,GN,MV,GB",5,"China,Cambodia,India,Gibraltar,Malaysia,Guinea,Maldives,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Asia,Europe,Asia,Africa,Asia,Europe"
"Under- CUR BENTS, are dittintfl from the upper or ap¬ parent, and in different places fet or drive a contrary way. Dr Smith makes it highly probable, that in the Downs, in the (traits of Gibraltar, there, is an under current, whereby as much water is carried cut as is brought in by the upper currents. This he argues from the offing between the North and South Foreland, where it runs tide and half-tide, i. e. it is ebb or flood in that part of the Downs three hours before it is fo off at fea : a certain fign, that though the tide of flood runs aloft, yet the tide of ebb runs under-foot, i. e. clofe by the ground ; and (o at the tide of ebb it will flow under foot.

"The natives pronounce it tear, or -zaar; and this, by corruption (it has been fancied), from Cafar, “ em- peror,” from fome imagined relation to the Roman emperors. But this etvmology does not feem corre£E When the czar Peter formerly required of the Euro¬ pean courts an acknowledgement of his imperial titles, i, and that the appellation of Emperor tt\ould never be omitted, there was great difficulty made about it, elpecially at the court of Vienna ; which occafioned him to produce the famous letter, written in the Ger¬ man tongue, from Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, to Vaffili Ivanovitch, confirming a treaty of alliance offenfive and defenfive againft Sigifmund king of Po¬ land. In this difpatch, which is dated Auguft the 4th, 1514, and is ratified with the feal of the golden bull, Maximilian addreffts Vaffili by calling him Kayfer and Herrfcher aller Rujfen, “ emperor and ruler of all the Ruffias.” But independently of this document, there could be no doubt that the foreign courts, in their intercourfe with that of Mofcow, ftyled the fove- reigns indilcriminately Great Duke, Czar, and Em¬ peror. With refpeft to England in particular, it is certain that in Chancellor’s Account of Ruffia, fo early as the middle of the 16th century, Ivan Vaffilie- vitch II. is called Lord and Emperor of all Ruf/ia ; and in the Englith difpatches, from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Anne, he is generally addreffed under the fame appellation.

When Peter, therefore, determined to affume the title of em¬ peror, he found no difficulty in proving that it had been conferred upon his predeceffors by moft of the European powers j yet when he was delirous of affix¬ ing to the term the European fenfe, it was confidered as an innovation, and was produftive of more negotia¬ tions than would have been requifite for the termina¬ tion of the moft important ftate affair. At the fame time it occafioned a curious controverfy among the learned, concerning the rife and pmgrefs of the titles by which the monarchs of this country have been di- ftinguiffied.

"Befides thefe kinds of damps, which are very com¬ mon, we find others deferibed in the Philofophical Tranfaftions, concerning the nature of which we can fay nothing. Indeed the account feems fomewhat fuf- picious. They are given by Mr Jeffop, from whom we have the foregoing obfervations concerning the fire¬ damp, and who had thefe from the miners in Derby- fhire. After defcribing the common damp, which confifls of fixed air, “ They call the fecond fort (fays he) the peafe-bloom damp, becaufe, as they fay, it fmells like peafe-bloom. They tell me it always comes in the fummer time j and thofe grooves are not free which are never troubled with any other fort of damps. I never heard that it was mortal j the fcent, perhaps freeing them from the danger of a furprife : but by reafon of it many good grooves lie idle at the belt and moft profitable time of the year, when the fubterrane- ous waters are the lowefl. They fancy it proceeds from the multitude of red trefoil flowers, by them called ho- neyfuchles, with which the limeftone meadows in the Peake do much abound. The third is the ftrangeft and moft peftilential of any j if all be true which is faid con¬ cerning it. Thofe who pretend to have feen it (for it is vifible) defcribe it thus: In the higheft part of the roof of thofe paflages which branch out from the main groove, they often fee a round thing hanging, about the bignefs of a foot-ball, covered with a fldn of the thicknefs and colour of a cobweb. This, they fay, if it is broke by any accident, as the fplinter of a ftone, or the like, difperfeth itfelf immediately, and fuffocates all the company. Therefore, to prevent cafualties, as foon as they have efpied it, they have a way, by the help of a ftick and long rope, of breaking it at a di- ftance j which done, they purify the place well with fire, before they dare enter it again. I dare not a- vouch the truth of this ftory in all its circumftances, becaufe the proof of it feems impoflible, fince they fay it kills all that are likely to bear witnefs to the parti¬ culars : neither do I deny but fuch a thing may have been feen hanging on the roof, fince I have heard many affirm it.”—Some damps, feemingly of the fame nature with thofe laft mentioned, are noticed by the author of the Chemical Diflionary, under the word Damps. “ Amongft the noxious mineral exhalations (fays he), we may place thofe which are found in the mines of fal gem in Poland. Thefe frequently appear in form of light flocks, threads, and fpiders webs. They are remarkable for their property of fuddenly catching fire at the lamps of the miners with a terrible noife and explofion. They inftantly kill thofe whom they touch. Similar vapours are found in fome mines of foffil coal.” With regard to the formation of damps we have as yet no certain theory ; nor, though the experiments of aerologifts are abundantly able to (how the compo- fition and manner of forming thefe noxious airs arti¬ ficially, have they yet thrown much light on the me¬ thod by which nature prepares them on a large fcale",,PL,5,Poland,Europe

In favour of the for¬ mer opinion it may be urged, that old waftes are ne¬ ver free from damps, efpecially thofe of the kind re- fembling fixed air j nor are they always deficient in the inflammable kind. The fame is alfo true of old wells, or even cellars, and in fliort every place where the air ftagnates for any confiderable time.

For their fymphony they have wooden drums, fome thing in form of a kettle-drum, with a kind of pipe or fla¬ geolet, made of a hollow cane or reed, but very gra¬ ting to an European ear. It is obferved they love every thing that makes a noife, how difagreeable fo- ever the found is.

This muni¬ ficent patron (fays Boccacio) commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the ftreets of Ravenna by the moft illuftrious citizens, to be depofited in a marble coffin. He pronounced himfelf the funeral oration, and expreffed his defign of erefting a fplendid monu¬ ment in honour of the deceafed : a defign which his fubfequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accom- pliffi.

The proje&or and leader of the Darien expedition was a clergyman of the name of Paterfon ; who having a violent pro- penfity to fee foreign countries, he made his profeflion the inftrument of indulging it, by going to the new weftern world, under pretence of converting the In¬ dians to the religion of the old. In his courfes there, he became acquainted with Captain Dampier and Mr Wafer, who afterwards publilhed, the one his Voyages, and the other his T ravels, in the region where the fe- paration is narrowed between the Atlantic and the South feas ; and both of whom, particularly the fird, appear by their books to have been men of confider- able obfervation. But he got much more knowledge from men who could neither write nor read, by culti¬ vating the acquaintance of fome of the old bucaniers, Vfeo, after furviving their glories and their crimes, dill, in the extremity of age and misfortune, recounted with tranfport the eafe with which they had paffed and repaffed from the one fea to the other, fometimes in hundreds together, and driving drings of mules before them loaded with the plunder of friends and of foes","Of, Darien","IE,TR,US",5,"Ireland,Turkey,United States","Europe,Asia,North America"

But that happened to him which has happened to many in his fituation : the perfons to whom he applied made ufe of his ideas, took the honour of them to themfelves, were civil to him for a while, and negle&ed him after¬ wards.

With refpeCt to natural beauty, he obferves, that uniformity amidft variety pleafes, becaufe of the natures of variety and uniformi¬ ty, which are fuch, that whenever united, they are adapted to pleafe every unbiaffed mind that difcerns them. He accounts for the pleafure they afford, with¬ out referring them to an arbitrary internal fenfe, by the following circumftances that attend them. They are more eafily comprehended by the mind : order and fym- metry give things their liability and ftrength, and fub- ferviency to any valuable purpofe *, regularity and order evidence art and defign. Diforder and confufion, whence deformity arifes, denote only the negation of regularity and order j or any arrangement and difpofi- tion of things, which are not according to a law, rule, or plan, and prove not defign.

"Another great prefervative of health is moderate ex- ercife, which few deformed perfons can want ftrtngth to perform.

He will alfo efcape many accidents, to which men of athletic make, and who glory in their ftrength, are always expofing them- felves to make trial and proof of it. If he cannot carry an ox, like Milo, he will not like Milo be hand¬ cuffed in the oak by attempting to rend it. He will not be the man that ffiall ride from London to York in a day. or to Windfor in an hour, for a wager j or that ftiall be perpetually performing furprifing long journeys in a furprifing ffiort time, for no earthly bu- finefs but the pleafure of relating them.

In after times, Croefus, the wealthieft of monarchs, was par¬ ticularly munificent in his donations. This facred repofitory of opulence wras therefore often the ob- jeCl of plunder.

After this, however, he gives a folution of the ftory, upon the fuppofition that Nous is the fame with the Greek word vs#?, the mind : that ‘ the mind was Prometheia; and Prome¬ theus was faid to renew mankind, from new forming their minds, and leading them, by cultivation, from ignorance.1 “ Suidas has preferved, from fome ancient author, a curious memorial of this wonderful perfonage, whom he affe&s to diftinguifh from Deucalion, and ftyles Nannacus. According to him, this Nannacus was a perfon of great antiquity, and prior to the time of Deucalion. He is faid to have been a king, who forefeeing the approaching deluge, collefted every body together, and led them to a temple, where he offered up his prayers for them, accompanied with ] BEL many tears. There is likewife a proverbial expref- fion about Nannacus applied to people of great anti- 6 quity. ' 'J “ Stephanus gives great light to this hiftory, and fup- plies many deficiencies. “ The tradition is (fays he), that there was one formerly named Annaeus, the extent of whofe life was above 300 years. The people who were of his neighbourhood and acquaintance had inquired of an oracle how long he was to live j and there was an anfwer given, that when Annaeus died, all mankind would be deftroyed. The Phrygians, upon this ac¬ count, made great lamentations, from whence arofe the proverb re S7r< Airvax-y the lamentation of Annaeus, made ufe of for people in circumftances highly calamitous. When the flood of Deucalion came, all mankind were deftroyed, according as the oracle had foretold. Afterwards, when the furface of the earth began to be again dry, Zeus ordered Prome¬ theus and Minerva to make images of clay in the form of men ; and, when they were finiftred, he called the winds, and made them breathe into each, and render them vital.” From thefe hiftories Mr Bryant concludes as fol¬ lows : ^ However the ftory may have been varied, the principal outlines plainly point out the perfon who is alluded to in thefe hiftories. It is, I think, mani- feft, that Annaeus, and Nannacus, and even Inachus, relate to Noachus or Noah. And not only thefe, Inacl^s but the hiftories of Deucalion and Prometheus have Deucalion, a like reference to the patriarch 5 in the 600th year, and Prome- and not the 300th, of whofe life the waters pre. theus»the vailed upon the earth.

And though the ftory is told with fome variation, yet in all the circumftances of confequence it accords very happily with the mythology of Egypt, Syria, and Greece.

We have the mundane egg upon the waters, and the concomi¬ tant fymbol of the moon ; and the egg at la A opened by the afliftance of the facred fleer, upon which, the world iflues forth to this day.” The author proceeds afterwards to mention the great veneration paid in thefe parts to the ox and cow j and fays, that nobody dares injure them. One deity of the Japanefe was Canon, the reputed lord of the ocean. He was repre¬ fented in an ere<fl pofture, crowned w'ith a flower, and coming out of the mouth of a fifli. He is reprefented in the fame manner by the natives of India, and named Vijhnou and Macauter ; and he is to be found in other parts of the eaft.

"The method of drawing a vertical declining dial by the fedlor, is almoft evident from what has been al¬ ready faid in dialling.

"II. The DIALLING XW^-OW is another new inftrument of great utility in the piaftice of dialling *, and was alfo contrived by the late Mr Martin. It is compofed of two graduated feales and a plane one. On the fcale AB (fig. 36.) is graduated the line of latitudes; and on the fcale AC, the line of hours : thefe properly con¬ joined with the plane fcale BD, as ftiown in the figure, truly reprefent the gnomonical triangle, and is pro¬ perly called a dialling trigon. The hour-fcale AC is here of its full length ; fo that the hours, halves, quar-r ters, &c. and every fingle minute (if required) may be immediately fet off by a fteel point ; and from what has before been obferved in regard to the feftor, it rouft appear that this method by the trigon is the moft expeditious way of drawing dials that any mechanifm of this fort can afford. As an example of the application of the trigon in the conftruftion of an horizontal dial for the latitude of London 510 32', you muft proceed as follows : Apply the trigen to the 6 o’clock line a f (fig. 29.) on the morning fide, fo that the line of la¬ titudes may coincide with the 6 o’clock line, and the beginning of the divifions coincide with the centre a ; and at ?i° 3 2! of the line of latitudes place the 6 o’clock edge of the line of hours, and the other end or begin¬ ning of the fcale clofe againft the plane fcale c d, as by the figure at d, and faftening thefe bars down by the feveral pins placed in them to the paper and board, then the hours, quarters, &c. are all marked off with a fteel point inftantly, and the hour lines drawn through them as before, and as fliown in the figure. When this is done for the fide a f or morning hours, you move the fcale of latitudes and hours to the other fide, c e, or afternoon fide, and place the hour-fcale to 310 32' as before, and pufti down the hours, quarters, Stc. and draw the lines through them for the afternoon hours, which is clearly reprefented in the figure",London,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe

"Culture. Though the carnations grow freely in al- moft any garden earth, aYid in it produce beautiful flowers, yet they are generally fuperior in that of a light loamy nature ; and of this kind of foil the florifts generally prepare a kind of compoft in the following manner, efpecially for thofe fine varieties which they keep in pots. A quantity of loamy earth muft be provided, of a light fandy temperature, from an up¬ land or dry pafture field or common, taking the top fpit turf and all, which muft be laid in a heap for a year, and turned over frequently. It muft then be mixed with about one-third of rotten dung of old hot¬ beds, or rotten neats dung, and a little fea-fand, form¬ ing the whole into a heap again, to lie three, four, or fix months, at which time it will be excellent for ufe \ and if one parcel or heap was mixed with one of thefe kinds of dungs, and another parcel with the other, it will make a change, and may be found very beneficial in promoting the fize of the flowers. This compoft, or any other made ufe of for the purpofe, (hould not be fifted, but only well broken with the fpade and hands.—When great quantities of carnations are re¬ quired, either to furnifh large grounds, or for market, or when it is intended to raife new varieties, it is eafily effe&ed by fowing fome feed annually in fpring, in common earth, from which the plants will rife abun¬ dantly. Several good varieties may alfo be exposed from the plants of each fowing; and noflibly not one exaftly like thofe from which the feed was faved. The Angle flowers are always more numerous than the double ones y but it is from the latter only that we are to fe- 3 8 ] D I A left our varieties. The feafon for fowing the feed is tv f« any time from the 20th of March to the 15th ' r' ^ April.—The plants generally come up in a month af¬ ter fowing : they muft be occafionally weeded and wa¬ tered till July, when they will be fit for tranfplanting into the nurfery beds. Thefe beds muft be made about three feet wide, in an open fituation ; and ta¬ king advantage of moift weather, prick the plants therein four inches afunder, and finifh with a gentle watering, which repeat occafionally till the plants have taken good root. Here they muft remain till Septem¬ ber, when they will be fo well advanced in growth as to require more room j and (hould then have their final tranfplantation into other three feet wide beds of good earth, in rows 9 inches afunder, where they are to be placed in the order of quincunx. Here they are to remain all winter, until they flower, and have ob¬ tained an increafe of the approved varieties of doubles by layers: and until this period, all the culture they require is, that if the winter (hould prove very fevere, an occafional (belter of mats will be of advantage. In fpring, the ground muft be loofened with a hoe ; they muft be kept clear from weeds : and when the flower- ftalks advance they are to be tied up to flicks, efpe¬ cially all thofe that promife by their large flower-pods to be doubles",March,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe
"The only certain method of propagating the double varieties is by layers. The proper parts for layers are thofe leafy (hoots arifing near the crown of the root, which, when about five, fix, or eight inches long, are of a proper degree of growth for layers. The general feafon for this work is June, July, and the beginning of Auguft, as then the (hoots will be arrived at a proper growth for that operation ; and the fooner it is done after the (hoots are ready the better, that they may have fufficient time to acquire ftrength before winter j thefe laid in June and July will be fit to take off in Auguft and September, fo will form fine plants in the month of Oftober. The method of performing the work is as follows. Firft provide a quantity of fmall hooked flicks for pegs. They muft be three or four inches long 5 and their ufe is to peg the layers down to the ground. Get ready alfo in a barrow a quantity of light rich mould, to raife the earth, if neceffary, round each plant, and provide alfo a (harp penknife. The work is begun by dripping off all the leaves from the body of the (hoots, and (hortening thefe at top an inch or two evenly. Then choofe a ftrong joint on the middle of the (hoot or thereabouts, and on the hack or under fide thereof, cut with the penknife the joint half way through, direfting your knife upwards fo as to (lit the joint up the middle, al- moft to the next joint above, by which you form a kind of tongue on the back of the (hoot *, obferving that the fvvelling (kinny part of the joint remaining at the bottom of the tongue muft be trimmed off, that nothing may obftruft the iffue of the fibres ; for the layers always form their roots at that part. This done, loofen the earth about the plant •, and, if neceffary, add fome frefh mould, to raife it for the more ready recep¬ tion of the layers; then with your finger make a hol¬ low or drill in the earth to receive the layer ; which bend horizontally into the opening, railing the top up¬ right, fo as to keep the gafli or flit part of the layer open j and, with one of the hooked flicks, peg down D I A [2 Diantlius the body of the layer, to fecure it in its proper place Diapafon! and pofition, dill preferving the top ereft and the flit —y—'open, and draw the earth over it an inch or two,bring¬ ing it clofe about the credit part of the ftioot ; and when all the {hoots of each plant are thus laid, give direftly fotne water to fettle the earth clofe, and the work is finifhed. In dry weather the waterings mult be often repeated, and in five or fix weeks the layers will have formed good roots. They mult then be fe- parated with a knife from the old plant, gently railed out of the earth with the point of a knife or trowel, in order to preferve the fibrous roots of the layers as en¬ tire as poflible ; and when thus taken up, cut off the naked fticky part at bottom clofe to the root, and trim the tops of the leaves a little. They are then ready for planting either into beds or pots. In November the fine varieties in pots fliould be moved to a funny fheltered fituation for the winter ; and if placed in a frame, to have occafional protedition from hard froft, it will be of much advantage. In the latter end of Fe¬ bruary, or fome time in March, the layers in the fmall pots, or fuch as are in beds, fliould be tranfplanted with balls into the large pots, where they are to remain for flower. To have as large flowers as poflible, curious florifts clear off all fide {boots from the flower ftem, fuf- fering only the main or top buds to remain for flower¬ ing. When the flowers begin to open, attendance fliould be given to aflifl the fine varieties, to promote their regular expanfion, particularly the largeft kinds called burjiers, whofe flowers are fometimes three or four inches diameter. Unlefs thefe are aflifted by art, they are apt to burft open on one fide, in which cafe the flower will become very irregular ; therefore, at¬ tending every day at that period, obferve, as foon as the calyx begins to break, to cut it a little open at two other places in the indenting at top with narrow-point¬ ed fciffars, and hereby the more regular expanfion of the petals will be promoted : obferving, if one fide of any flower comes out fafter than another, to turn the pot about, that the other fide of the flower may be next the fun, which will alfo greatly promote its regular expan¬ fion. Wben any fine flower is to be blown as large and fpreading as poflible, florifts place fpreading paper col¬ lars round the bottom of the flowers, on which they may fpread their petals to the utmoft expanfion. Thefe collars are made of ftiff white paper, cut circular about three or four inches over, having a hole in the middle to receive the bottom of the flower, and one fide cut open to admit it. This is to be placed round the bot¬ tom of the petals in the infide of the calyx, the leaves of which are made to fpread flat for its fupport. The petals muft then be drawn out and fpread upon the col¬ lar to their full width and extent-, the longeft ones un- dermoft, and the next longeft upon thefe 5 and fo on 5 obferving that the collar muft nowhere appear wider than the flower "", and thus a carnation may be rendered very large and handfome",March,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe

The coniuls be¬ ing unable to raife forces for the defence of the ftate, becaufe the plebeians refufed to inlift if they were not difeharged of all the debts they had contra&ed with the patricians, the fenate found it neceflary to elett a new magiftrate with abfolute and uncontrollable power to take care of the ftate. The dictator remained in office for fix months, after which he was again ele£led if the affairs of the ftate feemed to be defperate $ but if tranquillity was re-eftabliffied, he generally laid down his power before the time was expired. He knew no fuperior in the republic, and even the laws were fub- je£ted to him. He was called didlator, becaufe di£lust named by the conful, or quoniam diclis ejus patebat po~ pulus, becaufe the people implicitly obeyed his com¬ mand. He was named by the conful in the night viva voce, and his eledtion was confirmed by the au¬ gurs. As his power was abfolute, he could proclaim war, levy forces, condudl them againft an enemy, and diffiand them at his pleafure. He puniffied as he pleafed, and from his decifion there lay no appeal, at leaft till latter times. He was preceded by 24 lidlors with the fafees ; during his adminiftration, all other officers, ex¬ cept the tribunes of the people, were fufpended, and 22 ] DIG he was the mafter of the republic.

In the time of a peftilence, a didlator was fometimes eledled, as alfo to hold the comitia or to celebrate the public feftivals, or drive a nail into the capitol, by which fuperftitious ceremony the Romans believed that a plague could be averted or the progrefs of an enemy flopped. This office, fo refpedtable and illuftrious in the firft ages of the republic, became odious by the perpetual ufurpa- tions of Sylla and Julius Cmiar 5 and after the death of the latter, the Roman fenate paffed a decree which for ever after forbade a didlator to exift in Rome.

"DIDEROT, Denys, an eminent French writer, was the fon of a cutler, and born at Langres in the year 1713.

But he difeovered fo little inclination for the ecclefiaftical profeffion, that his fa¬ ther fent him to Paris to profecute his ftudies, and af¬ terwards placed him with an attorney.

The ftudies to which Diderot devoted his attention were extremely various. Phyfics, geometry, metaphyfics, moral phi- lofophy, and belles lettres, were at different times the objects of his purfuit. He even indulged in poetry and works of invention y but attached himfelf chiefly to more ferious ftudies.

"One of the firft of his publications was a tranflation of “ Stanyan’s Hiltory of Greece.” In the year 1745 he publiftred “ Principles of Moral Philofophy,” 1 2mo, a work by which he obtained fome reputation. But the year following, when he publiftied a piece entitled Penfees Philofophiques, he acquired confiderable cele¬ brity. This work was highly commended by the par¬ tizans of the new philofophy, among whom he had now enlifted himfelf, and became one of its moft zealous dif- ciples. The fame work was afterwards reprinted un¬ der the title of Etrennes aux Efprits Forts. It was greatly read, and it is fuppofed contributed much to the diffufion of thofe free opinions which had now be¬ come fo prevalent in France. Soon after this period, in conjun&ion with his friend D’Alembert, the plan ofthevaft undertaking, the DiBionnaireEncijclopedicjue, was laid. The profeffed objedf of this work was to become a magazine for every branch of human know- ledge j but at the fame time, it has been alleged that it was alfo intended by the authors and editors as the great engine by means of which the eftablilhed opinions, whether of a religious or political nature, which they fuppofed had their origin in fraud and fuperftition, Ihould be fubverted. The province of this work which was entrufted to Diderot was the defeription of Arts and Trades, (Arts et Metiers), But,befides, he contributed many other articles in various departments of fcience",,"GR,FR",5,"Greece,France","Europe,Europe"
"Among thefe he publiftied, “ A letter on the Blind, for the ufe of thofe who fee.” This work made a good deal of noife, and in confequence of fome of the lenti- ments which it contained, had given offence to the go¬ vernment, for which the author was kt ;;t in confine¬ ment for fix months at Vincennes. This piece was foon followed by another, entitled “ A letter on the Deaf and Dumb, for the ufe of thofe who hear and fpeak,” 2 vols l2mo, 1751. “ The Sixth Senfe,” pub¬ liftied in 1752; “ Thoughts on the interpretation of Nature,” 1754 ; “The Code of Nature,” 1755, are fi- milar works, and may be ranked in the fame clafs. His moral charaCIer was confiderably affeCItd by the pub¬ lication of Bijoux IndifcretA, 2 vols. 12rno ; which is a collection of licentious tales; for this indeed he made fome kind of compenfation, when he publiftied two profe comedies, Le Fils Nature!, 17375 and Le Fere de Famille, 1758 5 which are not only interefting as dramatic pieces, but exhibit a pure and correCt mo¬ rality. The latter is confidered as one of the belt co¬ medies of the fentimental kind which has appeared on the French ftage. It has indeed received univerfal admiration. He publiftied afterwards a pamphlet “ On Public Education,” which contains undoubtedly fome ufeful hints 5 but at the fame time it propofes many things which are impracticable. To the lift of his works now mentioned we may add, “ An Eulogy on Richardfon,” which is full of warmth and enthufiafm 5 and “ An Effay on the Life and Writings of Seneca the Philofopher.” This was his laft work, and was pub- liflied in 1779. Among fome obfervations on this work by the Monthly Reviewers, the author of it is thus charafterized : “ The works of M. Diderot, fays the writer, have long fince difgufted the model! vota¬ ries of true philofophy, by the tone of arrogance and felf-fufficiency, and the froth and fumes of a declama¬ tory eloquence, that form their effential and diftimftive chara&er.” “ It contains, it is farther added, like the other writings of that author, a glaring mixture of good and bad 5 of brilliant thoughts and obfeure reafonings j of fentences that dart from the imagination with the energy of lightning, and cloudy periods of metaphy¬ fical rhetoric, that convey either no ideas, or falfe ones.” The chara&er of Diderot fuffered confiderably from fome defamatory attacks which he made on his former friend Rouffeau, who had quarrelled with the French philofophers, and had feparated himfelf from their fchool",Vincennes,"FR,US",5,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"From the “ Confeflions” of the Genevan philofopher, it' would appear that they expedted fume anecdotes which would not have been much to their honour. In one of his letters Rouffeau thus fpeaks of Diderot. His words are remarkable, as they are equally applicable to his own character. “ Although born with a good heart and an open difpofition, he had an unfortunate propenfity to mifinterpret the words and adtions of his friends 5 and the moft ingenuous explanations only fup- plied his fubtle imagination with new interpretations againft them.” Diderot was married and had a family} and although he poffeffed fome irritability of temper, he was a kind hufband and a tender parent. At the com- clufion of the Didtionary, the ft ate of his affairs ren¬ dered; 1 DID [ 229 ] DIE Diderot, dered it neceffary for him to difpofe of his library. It was Dido, purchafed by the emprefs of Ruffia, who, with the king — v-""11 of Pruffia, was at that time the great encourager and promoter of literature and literary men. Thefe fove- reigns were alfo confidered as difciples of the French fchool. The price which Diderot received for his libra¬ ry was 50,000 livres •, and he was to have the ufe of it during his life. Some of his biographers, with rvhat truth we pretend not to fay, have not hefitated to charge him with difpoting of it a fecond time *, and when fome perfon commiffioned by the emprefs wilhed to fee it, the philofopher declined the vifit by excufes till he had time to fill it with books borrowed from bookfellers",,FR,5,France,Europe

"As to the manner of the difperfion of the pofterity of Noah from the plain of Shinar, it was undoubtedly conduced with the utmoft regularity and order. The facred hiftorian informs us, that they were divided in their lands, every one according to his tongue, ac¬ cording to his family, and according to his nation, Gen. x. 5, 20, 31. j and thus, as Mr Mede obferves, they were ranged according to their nations, and every nation was ranged by their families j fo that each na¬ tion had a feparate lot, and each family in every na¬ tion. The following abftraft will ferve to give a ge¬ neral idea of their refpeflive fettlements: Japhet, Noah’s eldeft fon, had feven ions •, viz.

"Bfimita- One very great defideratum among the diftillers of |:'??fore'8n this country is, a method of imitating the foreign fpi- pfrits. rits, brandy, rum, gin, &c. to a tolerable degree of perfection ; and notwithftanding the many attempts that are daily made for this purpofe, the fuccefs in ge¬ neral hath been very indifferent. On this fubjeCt, Mr Cooper has the following obfervations, in his Complete Syflem of Diftillation : which, as they are S applicable to all other fpirits as well as brandy, Ave Method of fhaii jiere tranfcribe.—“ The general method of diftil- Irandles in ^'in& ^ran(^'t’s France need not be formally defcribed, ■ranee. as it differs in nothing from that praCtifed here in working from malt, wafti, or molaffes ; nor are they in the leaft more cleanly or exaCt in the operation. They only obferve more particularly to throw in a little of the natural ley into the ft ill along with the wine, ns finding this gives their fpirit the flavour for which it is generally admired abroad.—But, though brandy is ex- trafled from wine, experience tells us, that there is a great difference in the grapes from which the wine is made. Every foil, every climate, every kind of graces, varies with regard to the quantity and quality of the fpirits extracted from them. There are fome grapes which are only fit for eating; others for drying, as thofe of Damafcus, Corinth, Provence, and Avignon, but not fit to make wine.— Some wines are very pro¬ per for diftillation, and others much lefs fo. The wines of Languedoc and Provence afford a great deal of brandy by diftillation, when the operation is per¬ formed on them in their full ftrength. The Orleans wines, and thofe of Blois, afford yet more ; but the beft are thofe of the territories of Cogniac and An- daye ; which are, however, in the number of thofe the leaft drunk in France.

"“ It muft alfo be farther obferved, that all the wines for diftillation, as thofe of Spain, the Canaries, of Ali- cant, of Cyprus, of St Peres, of Toquet, of Grave, of Hungary, and others of the fame kind, yield very little brandy by diftillation ; and corvfcquently ""would coft: the diftiller confiderahly more than he could fell it for.

"Nor would there be fo great a fimilarity as there is be¬ tween the different kinds of French brandies, w7ere the ftrongeft wines ufed for this purpofe ; but this is rarely the cafe ; the weakeft and lowed; flavoured wines only are diftilled for their fpirit, or fuch as prove abfolutely unfit for any other ufe",,FR,5,France,Europe
"“ A large quantity of brandy is diftilled in France during the time of the vintage; for all thofe poor grapes that prove unfit for wine, are ufually firft ga¬ thered, preffed, their juice fermented, and direftly di¬ ftilled. This rids their hands of their poor wines at once, and leaves their calks empty for the reception of better. It is a general rule with them not to diftil wine that will fetch any price as wine} for, in thisftate, the profits upon them are vaftly greater than when re¬ duced to brandies. This large flock of fmall wines, with which they are almoft overrun in France, fuffi- ciently accounts for their making fuch vaft quantities of brandy in that country, more than in others which lie in warmer climates, and are much better adapted to the produ&ion of grapes.—Nor is this the only fund of their brandies; for all the wine that turns eager, is alfo condemned to the ftill ; and, in Ihort, all that they can neither export nor confume at home, which amounts to a large quantity ; ft nee much of the wine laid in for their family provifion is fo poor as not to keep during the time of fpending. ^ “ Hence many of our Englilh fpirits, with proper How bran- management, are convertible into brandies that fliall dy may be hardly be diftinguilhed from the foreign in many refpefts, ,™‘tatf‘d i* provided the operation be neatly performed. |r^5 Coun “ The common method of rectifying fpirits from alkaline falts, deflroys their vinofity, and in its Head introduces an urinous or lixivious tafte. But as it is abfolutely neceffary to reftore, or at leafl: to fubftitute in its room, fome degree of vinofity, feveral methods have been propofed, and a multitude of experiments performed, in order to difeover this great defideratum",,FR,5,France,Europe
"“ But the bed, and indeed the only method of imi¬ tating French brandies to perfection, is by an effential oil of wine ; this being the very thing that gives the French brandies their flavour. It muft, however, be remembered, that, in order to ufe even this ingredient to advantage, a pure taftelefs fpirit mult firfi be pro¬ cured j for it is ridiculous to expedt that this effentiat oil Ihould be able to give the agreeable flavour of French brandies to our fulfome malt fpirit, already loaded with its own naufeous oil, or ftrongly impregna¬ ted with a lixivious tafte from the alkaline falls uftd in re&ification. How a pure infipid fpirit may be ob¬ tained, has already been confidered ; it only therefore remains to fhow the method of procuring this effential oil of wine, which is this : “ Take feme cakes of dry wine lees, fuch as are ufed by our hatters •, diffolve them in fix or eight times their weight of water diftil the liquor with a flow fire, and feparate the oil with a ffeparating glafs 5 referving for the nicefl ufes only that which comes over firfi:, the fucceeding oil being coarfer and more refinous.-'—Hav¬ ing procured this fine oil of wine, it may be mixed into a quinteffence with pure alcohol •, by which means it may be preferved a long time fully pofleffed of all its flavour and virtues j but, without fuch management, it will foon grow refinous and rancid",,FR,5,France,Europe
"“ When a fine effential oil of wine is thus procured, and alfo a pure and infipid fpirit, French brandies may be imitated to perfection, with regard to the flavour",,FR,5,France,Europe
"It mufl, however, be remembered, and carefully ad¬ verted to, that the effential oil be drawn from the fame kind of lees as the brandy to be imitated was procured from •, we mean, in order to imitate Cogniac brandy, it will be neceffary to diftil the effential oil from Cogniac lees ; and the fame for any other kind of brandy. For, as different brandies have different flavours, and as thefe flavours are entirely owing to the effential oil of the grape, it would be prepofterous to endeavour to imitate the flavour of Cogniac brandy with an effential oil procured from the lees of Bonrdeaux wine.——When the flavour of the brandy is well imitated by a proper dofe of the effential oil, and the whole reduced into one Ample and homogeneous fluid, other difficulties are fiill behind : The flavour, though the effential part, is not, however, the only one ; the colour, the proof, and the foftnefs, mufl: alfo be regarded, before a fpirit that per¬ fectly refembles brandy can be procured. With re¬ gard to the proof, it may be eafily hit, by ufing a fpirit rectified above proof: which, after being intimately mixed with the effential oil of wine, may be let down to a proper Itandard with fair water. And the foft¬ nefs may, in a great meafure, be obtained by diftilling and rectifying the fpirit with a gentle fire j and what is wanting of this criterion in the liquor when firlt saade, will be fupplied by time $ for it muft be remem- 4 bered, that it is time alone that gives this property to Diftillation French brandies 5 they being at firft acrid, foul, and — fiery. But, with regard to the colour, a particular me¬ thod is required to imitate it to perfection. I0 “ The art of colouring fpirits owes its rife to obfer-Spirits how vations on foreign brandies. A piece of French brandy calcured",,FR,5,France,Europe
"that has acquired by age a great degree of foftnefs and ripenefs, is obferved at the fame time to have acquired a yellowifh brown colour 5 and hence our diftillers have endeavoured to imitate this colour in fuch fpirits as are intended to pafs for French brandy. And in order to this, a great variety of experiments have been made on different fubftances. Butin order to know a direCl and fure method of imitating this colour to perfeCHon, it is neceffary we (hould be informed whence the French brandies tbemftlves acquire their colour. This difeo- very is very eafily made. The common experiment of trying whether brandy will turn blackilh with a folu- tion of iron, (hows that the colour is owing to fome of the refinous matter of the oak calk diffolved in the fpi¬ rit. There can be no difficulty, therefore, in imitating this colour to perfeCHon. A {mall quantity of the ex¬ tract of oak, or the ffiavings of that wood, properly digefted, will fumilh us with a tinCture capable of gi¬ ving the fpirit any degree of colour required. But it muft be remembered, that as the tinCture is extracted from the calk by brandy, that is, alcohol and water, it is neceffary to ufe both in extracting the tinCture $ for each of thefe diffolves different parts of the wood",,FR,5,France,Europe
"“ There are other methods in ufe for colouring brandies j but the belt, befides the extraCt of oak above mentioned, are treacle and burnt fugar. The treacle gives the fpirit a fine colour, nearly refem¬ bling that of French brandy ; but as its colour is di¬ lute, a large quantity muft be ufed j this is not, how¬ ever, attended with any bad confequences ; for not- witbftanding the fpirit is really weakened, by this ad¬ dition, yet the bubble proof, the general criterion of fpirits, is greatly mended by the tenacity imparted to the liquor by the treacle. The fpirit alfo acquires from the mixture a fweetiffi or lufeious tafte, and a fulnefs in the mouth ; both which properties render it very agreeable to the palates of the common people, who are in faCt the principal confumers of thefe fpirits. A much fmaller quantity of burnt fugar than of treacle will be fufficient for colouring the fame quantity of ipi- rits : the tafte is alfo very different j for inftead ot the fwcetnefs imparted by the treacle, the fpirit acquires from the burnt fugar an agreeable bitternefs, and by that means recommends itfelf to nicer palates, which are offended with a lufeious fpirit. The burnt lugar is prepared by diffolving a proper quantity of fugar in D I S [267 iiftillation. a little water, and fcorching it over the fire till it ac- _ quires a black colour. Either treacle or burnt fugar •will nearly imitate the genuine colour of old French brandy ; but neither of them will fucceed when put to the tell of the vitriolic folution",,FR,5,France,Europe
"“ The fpirit diftilled from molaffes or treacle is very clean or pure. It is made from common treacle dif- folved in water, and fermented in the fame manner as the waih for the common malt fpirit. But if fome par¬ ticular art is not ufed in diftiliing this fpirit, it will not prove fo vinous as malt fpirit, but more flat and lefs pungent and acid, though otherwife much cleaner tailed, as its eflential oil is of a much lefs offenfive fla¬ vour. Therefore, if good frclh wine lees, abounding in tartar, be added and duly fermented with the mo- lafles, the fpirit will acquire a much greater vinofity and brilknefs, and approach much nearer to the nature of foreign fpirits. Where the molaffes fpirit is brought to the common proof ftrength, if it is found net to have a fufficient vinofity, it will be very proper to add fome good dulcified fpirit of nitre; and if the fpirit be clean worked, it may, by this addition onlv, be made to pafs on ordinary judges for French brandy. Great quanti¬ ties of this fpirit are ufed in adulterating foreign bran¬ dy, rum, and arrack. Much of it is alfo ufed alone in making cherry brandy and other drams by infufion ; in all which many, and perhaps with juftice, prefer it to foreign brandies. Molafies, like all other fpirits, is entirely colourlefs when firft extrafled ; but oilfillers always give it as nearly as pofiible the colour of foreign fpirits.” If thefe principles hold good, the imitation of fo¬ reign fpirits of all kinds mufi: be an eafy matter. It will only coft the procuring of fome of thofe fubftances from which the fpirit is draw.,; and diftiliing this with water, the effential oil will always give the flavour de- fired. Thus, to imitate Jamaica rum, it will only be neceffary to procure fome of the tops, or other ufelefs parts, of the fugar-canes ; from which an eflential oil being drawn, and mixed with clean molafles fpirit, will give it the true flavour. The principal difficulty mull lie in procuring a fpirit totally, or nearly free of all flavour of its own. The fpirit drawn from the refufe of a fugar-houfe is by our author commended as fupe- rior to that drawn from molafles : though even this is not entirely devoid of fome kind of flavour of its own ; nor indeed is that drawn from the bell refined fugar entirely flavourlefs. It is very probable, therefore, that to procure an abfolutely flavourlefs fpirit is impoffible",Much,"JM,DE,FR",5,"Jamaica,Germany,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"how far it will go in this refpeft, ten gallons of it be- ing often fufficient to give a determining flavour and agreeable vinofity to a whole piece of malt fpirits. It is therefore well worth the diftiller’s while to endea¬ vour at improving the common method of extiafling fpirits from raifins ; and perhaps the following hint may merit attention. When the fermentation is com¬ pleted, and the ftill charged with fermented liquor as above dire fled, let the whole be drawn off with as brifk a fire as poffible ; but, inftead of the calk or can generally ufed by diftillers for a receiver, let a large glafs, called by chemifts a feparating g/afs, be placed under the nofe of the worm, and a common receiver applied to the fpout of the feparating glafs : by this means the effential oil will fwim upon the top of the fpirit, or rather low wine, in the feparating glafs, and may be eafily preferved at the end of the operation.-— The ufe of this limpid effential oil is well known to di¬ ftillers; for in this refides the whole flavour, and con- fequently maybe ufed to the greateft advantage in giv¬ ing that diftinguilhing tafte and true vinofity to the common malt fpirits. After the oil is feparated from the low wine, the liquor may be reftified in balneo mariae into a pure and almoft taftelefs fpirit, and there¬ fore well adapted to make the fineft compound cor¬ dials, or to imitate or mix with the fineft French bran¬ dies, arracks, &c. In the fame manner a fpirk may be obtained from cyder. But as its particular flavour is not fo defirable as that obtained from raifins, it tliould be diftilled in a more gentle manner, and carefully rec¬ tified according to the direftior.s we have already Sivren” . . , ... 13 Thefe dire&ions may fuffice for the diftillation ofDireftions any kind of fimple fpirits.

"Cedrat water. The cedrat is a fpecxes of citron, and very highly efteemed in Italy, where it grows na¬ turally.

"Some authors derive the word from the Hebrew O'anvj* derujjim, or drujjim, which they tranflate con- tempiatores. Picard, Celtopaed. lib.Ji. p. 58. believes the druids to have been thus called from Druis, or Dryius, their leader, the fourth or fifth king of the Gauls, and father of Saron or Naumes. Pliny, Sal- mafius, Vigenere, &c. derive the name from oai ; on account of their inhabiting, or at lead frequenting, and teaching in forefts j or perhaps becaufe, as Pliny fays, they never faerificed but under the oak. But it is hard to imagine how the druids (bould come to fpeak Greek.

"Their opi- ^ ^een difputed whether the druids were nions and themfelves the inventors of their opinions and fyftems philofophy 0f religion and philofophy, or received them from whence Some have imagined, that the colony of Pho- cians which left Greece and built Marfeilles in Gaul about the 5‘7th Olympiad, imported the firfl. principles of learning and philofophy, and communicated them to the Gauls and other nations in the we,ll of Europe",,GR,5,Greece,Europe
"It appears, indeed, that this famous colony contribut¬ ed not a little to the Improvement of that part of Gaul where it fettled, and to the civilization of its in¬ habitants. “ The Greek colony of Marfeilles (fays Juftin) civilized the Gauls, and taught them to live under laws j to build cities and inclofe them with walls; to raife corn to cultivate the vine and olive ; and, in a word, made fo great a change both in the face of the country and the manners of its inhabitants, that Gaul feemed to be tranflated into Greece, rather than a few Greeks tranfplanted into Gaul.” But though we may allow that the druids of Gaul and Britain borrowed fome hints and embdliffiments of their philofophy from this Greek colony, and perhaps from other quarters, we have reafon to believe that the fubftance of it was their own. Others have fuggefted, that the druids derived their philofophy from Pythagoras, who pub- lifhed his doftrines at Crotona in Italy j where he lived in the higheft reputation for his virtue, wifdom, and learning, above 20 years. This conjeflure is very much confirmed by this remarkable expreffion of Am- mianus Marcellinus, “ That the druids were formed into fraternities, as the authority of Pythagoras de¬ creed.” It hath been alfo obferved, that the philofo- D R U phy of the druids bore a much greater refemblance to Druids, that of Pythagoras than to that of any other of the v—w fages of antiquity. But it feems probable, that Am- mianus meant no more by the above expreffion than to illuftrate the nature of the druidical fraternities, by comparing them to thofe of the Pythagoreans, which were well known to the Romans; and the refemblance between the Pythagorean and druidical philofophy may perhaps be beft accounted for, by fuppofing, that Pythagoras learned and adopted fome of the opinions of the druids, as well as imparted to them fome of his difcoveries. It is well known, that this philofopher, animated by the moll ardent love of knowledge, travel¬ led into many countries in purfuit of it, and got himielf admitted into every fociety that was famous for its learn¬ ing. It is therefore highly probable in itfelf, as well as direflly afferted by feveral authors, that Pythagoras heard the druids of Gaul, and was initiated into their philofophy. , From the concurring teftimonies of feveral au-More par. | thors, it appears that phyfiology, or natural philo-ticubr ac- I fophy, was the favourite ftudy of the druids of Gaul I and Britain. Cicero tells us, that he was perfonally the 1 acquainted with one of the Gaulilh druids, Divitia- cus the iEduan, a man of quality in his country, who profeffed to have a thorough knowledge of the laws of nature, or that fcience which the Greeks 4 call physics of physiology. According to Diodorus or | Siculus, Strabo, Caefar, Mela, Ammianus Marcel-1 linus, and others, they entered into many difqui- fitions and deputations in their fchools, concerning the form and magnitude of the univerfe in general, and of this earth in particular, and even concerning the moft fublime and hidden fecrets of nature. On thefe and the like fubjefts they formed a variety of fyftetns and hypothefes ; which they delivered to their difciples in verfe, that they might the more eafily retain them in their memories, fince they were not allowed to com¬ mit them to writing. Strabo hath preferved one of the phyfiological opinions of the druids concerning the univerfe ; viz. that it was never to be entirely deflroyed or annihilated ; but was to undergo a fucceffion of great changes and revolutions, which were to be produced fometimes by the power and predominancy of water, and fometimes by that of fire. This opinion, he inti¬ mates, was not peculiar to them, but was entertained alfo by the philofophers of other nations; and Cicero fpeaks of it as a truth univerfally acknowledged and un¬ deniable. “ It is impoffible for us (fays he) to attains glory that is eternal, or even of very long duration, on account of thefe deluges and conflagrations of the earth which mult neceffarily happen at certain periods.” This opinion, which was entertained by the mod an¬ cient philofophers of many different and Very diflant nations, was probably neither the refult of rational in¬ quiry in all thefe nations, nor communicated from one of them to others ; but defcended to them all from their common anceflors of the family of Noah by tra¬ dition, but corrupted and mifunderftood through length of time. The agreement of the druids with the phi¬ lofophers of fo many other nations in this opinion about the alternate diffolution and renovation of the world, gives us reafon to believe, that they agreed with them alfo in their opinion of its origin from two dif- tinft principles j the one intelligent and omnipotent, which [ 1 K R u [ 343 ] D R U Iruids. which was God 5 the other inanimate and inactive, -y—■ which was matter. We are told, by Caefar, that they had many difquifitions about the power of God j and, no doubt, amongft other particulars, about his creating power. But whether they believed with fome that mat¬ ter was eternal, or with others that it was created and in what manner they endeavoured to account for the difpofition of it into the prefent form of the univerfe, we are entirely ignorant, though they certainly had their fpeculations on thefe fubjefts. We are only in¬ formed, that they did not exprefs their fentiments on thefe and like heads in a plain and natural, but in a dark, figurative, and enigmatical manner. This might incline us to fufpeft, that Pythagoras had borrowed from them his doflrine about numbers, to whofe myfiti- cal energy he afcribes the formation of all things j for nothing can be more dark and enigmatical than that do£lrine. The druids difputed likewife about the mag¬ nitude and form of the world in general, and of the earth in particular, of which things they pretended to have a perfedt knowledge. We know not what their opinions were about the dimenfions of the univerfe or of the earth, but we have feveral reafons to make us imagine that they believed both to be of a fpherieal form. This is vifibly the (hape and form of the fun, moon, and liars, the mod confpicuous parts of the uni¬ verfe •, from whence it was natural and eafy to infer, that this was the form of the world and of the earth","Cicero, Cicero","GR,US,IT",5,"Greece,United States,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Among many other furprifing things, that author fays, concerning the Hyperborean itland, “ That its inhabi¬ tants believed that Apollo defeended into their illand at the end of every 19 years ; in which period of time the fun and moon, having performed their various revolu¬ tions, return to the fame point, and begin to repeat the fame revolutions. This is called by the Greeks the great year, or the cycle of Meton.” Their We are told both by Csefar and Mela, that the knowledge druids ftudied the liars as well as the fun and moon j of the ftars.ancl that they profeffed to know, and taught their difciples, many things concerning the motions of thefe heavenly bodies. From thefe teftimonies we may con¬ clude that the druids were acquainted with the pla¬ nets, diftinguifhed them from the fixed liars, and care¬ fully obferved their motions and revolutions. If this difeovery was the refult of their own obfervations, it would be gradual, and it would be a long time before they found out all the planets. They might perhaps have received fome aflillance and information from Py¬ thagoras, or from fome other quarter. But whether this difeovery of the planets was their own, or com¬ municated to them by others, it is highly probable that they were acquainted with the precife number of thefe wandering liars. Dio Cafiius fays, that the cullom of giving the name of one of the planets to each of the leven days of the week was an invention of the Egyp¬ tians, and from them was gradually communicated to all the other nations of the world ; and that in his time this cultom was fo firmly eltablilhed, not only among the Romans, but among all the reft of man¬ kind, that in every country it appeared to be a native inftitution. The knowledge of the planets, and per¬ haps the cuftom of giving their names to the days of the week, was brought out of Egypt into Italy by Pythagoras, more than 500 years before the beginning of the Chriftiaii era *, and from thence it could not be very long before it reached Gaul and Britain. Butv~-v-« though we have little or no reafon to doubt that the druids knew the number and obferved the motion of the planets, yet it may be queftioned whether they had difeovered the times in which they performed their fe- veral revolutions. Some of thefe liars, as Jupiter and Saturn, take fo great a number of years in revolving, that it required a very extraordinary degree of patience and attention to difeover the precife periods of their revolutions. If we could be certain that the ifland in which the ancients imagined Saturn lay afleep, was one of the Britilh ifles, as Plutarch intimates it was, we might be inclined to think that the Britilh druids were not ignorant of the length of the period in which the planet Saturn performs a revolution. For that fame au¬ thor, in another treatife, tells us, “ That the inhabi¬ tants of that illand kept every thirtieth year a folemn feftival in honour of Saturn, when his ftar entered into the fign oi Taurus.” If we could depend upon the above teftimony of Plutarch, we Ihould have one pofitive proof that the druids of the Britith ifles w’ere acquainted with the conftellations, and even with the ligns of the zodiac ; and that they meafured the revolutions of the fun and planets, by obfervmg the length of time betweeti their departure from and return to one of thefe figns* But we have no dirett evidence of this remaining in hiftory",Jupiter,"EG,IT,US",5,"Egypt,Italy,United States","Africa,Europe,North America"
"“ They fay further, that the moon is feen from that ifland, as if flie was but at a little diftance from the earth, and having hills or mountains like ours on her fur face.” But no fuch inference can be reafonahly drawn from this expreflion, which in reality merits little more regard than what Strabo reports was faid of fome of the inhabitants of Spain : “ That they heard the biffing noife of the fun every evening when he fell into the weftern ocean.” The application of the druids to the ftudy of phild- fophy and aftronomy amounts almnft to a demonflration that they applied alfo to the ftudy of arithmetic and geo¬ metry.

"Though the druids were unacquainted with the Ara¬ bic cbaraflers, which are now in ule, we have no rea- fon to fuppofe that they were delfitute of marks or characters of fome other kind, which, in fome mea- fure, anfwered the fame purpofes, both in making and recording their calculations. In particular, we have reafon to think, that they made ufe of the letters of the Greek alphabet for both thefe purpofes. This feems to be plainly intimated by Crefar in the follow¬ ing expreffion concerning the druids of Gaul: “ In almolt all other public tranfaflions and private ac¬ counts or computations, they mske ule of the Greek letters.” This is further confirmed by w bst the fame Author fays of the Helvetii ; a people of the fame ori¬ gin, language, and manners, with the Gauls and Bri¬ tons. “ Tables were found in the camp of the Hel¬ vetii written in Greek letters, containing an account of all the men capable of bearing arras, who bad left their native country, and alfo feparate accounts of the boys, old men, and women.” There i-s hiftorical evidence of the druids being alfo well acquainted with geome¬ try. “ When any difputes arife (fays Ccefiir) about their inheritances, or any controverfies about the -li¬ mits of their fields, they are entirely referred to the dec.ifion of their druids.” But befides the knowledge of uienfuration which this implies, both Cuefar and Mela plainly intimate that the druids were converiant in the mofi fublime (peculations of geometry 5 “ in meafuring the magnitude of the earth, and even of the 9 world.” 11 in me- There are ftill many monuments remaining in uues.

For this purpofe they make ufe of the miniftry of the druids ; becaufe they have declared, that the anger of the immortal gods cannot be appeafed, fo as to fpare the life of one man, but by tire life of another.” I his way of thinking gave rife alfo to that great number of magical rites and incantations with which the medical practices of the druids, and indeed of all the phyficians of antiquity, were attended. “ Nobody doubts (fays Pliny) that magic derived its origin from medicine, and that, by its flattering but delufive promifes, it came to be efteemed the muft fublime and facred part of the art of healing.” That the druids made great ufe of herbs for medi¬ cinal purpofes, we' have fufficient evidence. They not only had a moft fuperftitious veneration for the mifle- toe of the oak, on a religious account, but they alfo entertained a very high opinion of its medical virtues, and efteemed it a kind of panacea or remedy for all difeafes. “ They call it (fays Pliny) by a name which in their language fignifies All-heal, becaufe they have an opinion that it cureth all difeafes.” They believed it to be in particular a fpecifie againft barrennefs, and a fovereign antidote againft the fatal effefts of poifons of all kinds. It was efteemed alfo an excellent emol¬ lient and difcutient for foftening and difcufling hard tumours *, good for drying up fcrophulous fores ; for curing ulcers and wounds j and (provided it was not fuffered to touch the earth after it was cut) it was thought to be a very efticacious medicine in the epi- lepfy or falling ficknefs. It hath been thought ufeful in this laft calamitous difeafe by feme modern phyfi¬ cians. The pompous ceremonies with which the mifle- toe was gathered by the druids have been already de- feribed. ^ The felago, a kind of hedge hyflop refem- bling favin, was another plant much admired by the druids of Gaul and Britain for its fuppofed medicinal virtues, particularly in all difeafes of the eyes. But its efficacy, according to them, depended very much upon its being gathered exactly in the following manner: The perfon who gathered it was to be clothed in a white robe 5 to have his feet bare, and waffied in pure water \ to offer a facrifice of bread and wine before he proceeded to cut it j which he was to do with his right hand covered with the Ikirt of his garment, and with a hook of feme more precious metal than iron. When it was cut, it was to be received into, and kept in a new and very clean cloth. When it was gathered exactly according to this whimfical ritual, they affirmed that it was not only an excellent medicine, but alfo a powerful charm and prefervative from misfortunes and unhappy accidents of all kinds. They entertained a high opinion alfo of the herb famolus or marffivvort, for its fanative qualities ; and gave many diredlions for the gathering it, no lefs fanciful than thofe above men¬ tioned. The perfon who was to perform that office was to do it falling, and with his left hand } he was on no account to look behind him, nor to turn his face from the herbs he was gathering. It would be tedious to relate the extravagant notions they entertained of the rnany virtues of the vervain, and to recount the ridi¬ culous raummertes which they pra&ifed in gathering 3 and preparing it, both for the purpofes of divination and phyfic.

"As the influence and authority of the druids in their country, depended very much upon the reputation of their fuperior wifdom and learning, they wifely applied to the fludy of thofe fciences which moft direftly con¬ tributed to the fupport and advancement of that repu¬ tation. In this number, befides thofe already mention¬ ed, we may juftly reckon rhetoric, which was diligent¬ ly ftudied and taught by the druids of Gaul and Bri¬ tain ; who to the charms of their eloquence were in¬ debted for much of the admiration and authority which they enjoyed. They had indeed many calls and oppor¬ tunities to difplay their eloquence, and to difcover its great power and efficacy *, as when they were teach¬ ing their pupils in their fchools ; when they difcourfed in public to the people on religious and moral fubje&s ; when they pleaded caufes in the courts of juttice ; and when they harangued in the great councils of the na¬ tion, and at the heads of armies ready to engage in battle, fometimes with a view to inflame their cou¬ rage, and at other times with a defign to allay their fury, and difpofe them to make peace. Though this laft was certainly a very difficult talk among fierce and warlike nations, yet fuch was the authority and elo¬ quence of the druids, that they frequently fucceeded in it. “ They pay a great regard (fays Diodorus Si¬ culus) to their exhortations, not only in the affairs of peace, but even of war, and thefe are refpedfed both by their friends and enemies. They fometimes flep in between two hoflile armies, who are Handing with their fvvords drawn and their fpears extended, ready to en¬ gage ; and by their eloquence, as by an irrefiftible en¬ chantment, they prevent the eft'ufinn of blood, and prevail upon them to fheatb their fwords. So great are the charm« of eloquence and the power of wifdom even amongft the moft fierce barbarians.” The Britifh kings and chieftains, who were educated by the druids, were famous for their eloquence. This is evident from the many noble fpeeches which are afcribed to them by the Greek and Roman writers. For though thefe fpeeches may not be genuine, yet they are a proof that it was a well known faft, that thefe princes were ac- cuftomed to make harangues on thefe and the like oc- cafions. This we are exprefsly told by Tacitus :— “ The Britilh chieftains, before a battle, fly from rank to rank, and addrefs their men with animating fpeeches, tending to inflame their courage, increafe their hopes, and difpel their fears.” Thefe harangues were call¬ ed, in the ancient language of Britain, Brofmchty Kah, which is literally tranflated by Tacitus, Incita- menta Belli, “ incentives to Avar.” The genuine po- fterity of the ancient Britons long retained their tafte for eloquence, and their high efteem for thofe who ex¬ celled in that art. “ Orators (fays Mr Martin) were in high efieem, both in thefe illands (the ^Ebudae) and the continent, until within thefe forty years. I hey fat always among the nobles or chiefs of families in the ftreah or circle. Their houfes and little villages were fanftuaries, as well as churches, and they took place before doctors of phyfie. The orators, after the druids were extinft, were brought in to preferve the genealogy of families, and to repeat the fame at every lueceflion of a chief; and upon the occafion of mar¬ riages and births, they made epithalamiums and pane¬ gyrics, which the poet or bard pronounced. The ora- Druids, tors, by the force of their eloquence, had a poAverful \i afcendant over the greateft men in their time. For if any orator did but afk the habit, arms, horfe, or any other thing belonging to the greateft man in thefe iHands, it Avas readily granted him •, fometimes out of re I peel, and fometimea for fear of being exclaimed a- gainft by a fatire, which in thofe days Avas reckoned a great diffionour.” ^ If the Britiffi druids, confidering the times in which jyjagjc^an^ they lived, had made no contemptible proficiency in divination, feveral parts of real and ufeful learning, it cannot be denied that they Avere alfo great pretenders to fupe¬ rior knowledge in certain vain fallacious fciences, by Avhich they excited the admiration, and took advan¬ tage of the ignorance and credulity of mankind. Thefe were the fciences (if they may be fo called) of magic and divination ; by Avhich they pretended to work a kind of miracles, and exhibit aftonilhing appearances in nature ; to penetrate into the counfels of heaven \ to foretel future events, and to difcover the fuccefs or mifcarriage of public or private undertakings. Their own countrymen not only believed that the druids of Gaul and Britain were poffeffed of thefe poAvers, but they Avere celebrated on this account by the philo- fophers of Greece and Rome. “ In Britain (fays Pliny) the magic arts are cultivated with fuch aftoniffi- ing fuccefs, and fo many ceremonies, at this day, that the Britons feem to be capable of inftrufting even the Perfians themfelves in thefe arts. They prefeend to difcover the defigns and purpofes of the gods. The Eubates or Vates in particular inveftigate and difplay the moft fublime fecrets of nature j and, by aufpices and facrifices, they foretel future events.” 1 hey Avere fo famous for the iuppofed veracity of their predic¬ tions, that they Avere not only confulted on all import¬ ant occafions by their own princes and great men, but even fometimes by the Roman emperors. Nor is it very difficult to account for all this. The druids finding that the reputation of their magical and pro¬ phetical poAvers contributed not a little to the ad¬ vancement of their Avealth and influence, they endea¬ voured, no doubt, to ftrengthen and eftabliffi it by all their art and cunning. Their knoAvledge of natural philofophy and mechanics enabled them to execute fuch Avorks, and to exhibit fuch appearances, or to make the world believe that they did exhibit them, as were fufficient to gain them the chara&er of great magicians. The truth is, that nothing is more eafy than to acquire this charadler in a dark age, and a- mong an unenlightened people. When the minds of men are haunted Avith dreams of charms and enchant¬ ments, they are apt to fancy that the moft common oc¬ currences in nature are the effects of magical arts. The following ftrange ftory, which avc meet AAnth in Plu¬ tarch’s Treatife of the Ceffation of Oracles, Avas pro¬ bably occafioned by fomething of this kind. “ There « are many illands which lie fcattered about the ifle of Britain after the manner of our Sporades.

"But thefe pretenfions of the druids to magic and divination, which contributed fo much to the advance¬ ment of their fame and fortune in their own times, have brought very heavy reproaches upon their memo¬ ry, and have made feme learned moderns declare that they ought to be expunged out of the catalogue of philofophers, and efleemed no better than mere cheats and jugglers. This cenfure is evidently too fevere, and might have been pronounced with equal juftice upon all- the ancient philofuphers of Egypt, Afiyria, Perfia, Greece, and Rome 5 who were great pretend¬ ers to magic and divination, as well as our druids. “ I know of no nation in the world (fays Cicero) either fo polite and learned, or fo favage and barbarous, as not to believe that future events are prefignified to us,, and may by fome men be difeovered and foretold.” The only conclufion therefore that can be fairly drawn, from the fuccefsful pretenfions of the Britifli druids to the arts of magic and divination, is this—-That they bad more knowledge than their countrymen and contem¬ poraries ; but had not fo much virtue as to refill the temp¬ tation of impofing upon their ignorance to their own ad¬ vantage","Rome, Cicero","US,EG,GR",5,"United States,Egypt,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"

"The moft general, or rather the foie caufe of dumbnefs, is the want of the fenfe of hearing. The ufe of lan¬ guage is originally acquired by imitating articulate founds. From this fiource of intelligence, deaf people are entirely excluded : they cannot acquire articulate founds by the ear : unlefs, therefore, articulation be communicated to them by fome other medium, thefe unhappy people muft for ever be deprived of the ufe of language; and as language is the principal fource of knowledge, whoever has the misfortune to want the fenfe of hearing, muft remain in a ftate little fuperior to that of the brute creation. Deafnefs has in all ages been confidered as fuch a total obftru&ion to fpeech or written language, that an attempt to teach the deaf to fpeak or read has been uniformly regarded as impra&ieable, till Dr Wallis and fome others have ©f late fhown, that although deaf people cannot learn to fpeak or read by the diredlion of the ear, there are other fources of imitation, by which the fame effett may be produced. The organs of hearing and of f|(eeeh have little or no connexion. Perfors deprived I of the former generally poffefs the latter in fuch per¬ fection, that nothing further is neceffary, in order to make them articulate, than to teach them how to ufe thefe organs. This indeed is no eafy talk ; but expe¬ rience (hows that it is practicable. Mr Thomas Braidwood, late of Edinburgh, was perhaps the firft who ever brought this furprifing art to any degree of perfection. He began with a fingle pupil in 1764; and fince that period has taught great numbers of people born deaf to fpeak diftinCtly ; to read, to write, to underftand figures, the principles of religion and morality, &c. At the time we firft converfed with him, being a few years after the commencement of his practice, he had a confiderable number of deaf pupils, fome of them above 20 years of age, all making a ra¬ pid and amazing progrefs in thofe ufeful branches of education. ",Edinburgh,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe
"Mr Braidwood’s principal difficulty, after he had difcovered this art, was to make people believe in the praflicability of it. He advertifed in the public pa¬ pers ; he exhibited his pupils to many noblemen and gentlemen $ ft ill he found the generality of mankind unwilling to believe him. A remarkable inftance of this incredulity appeared fome years ago. A gentle¬ man in England fent a deaf girl of his to Mr Braid- wood’s care. A year or two afterwards, Mr Braid- wood wrote to the father, that his daughter could fpeak, read, and write diftindtly. The father returned an anfwer, begging Mr Braidwood’s excufe, as he could not believe it : however, he defired a friend of his, who was occafionally going to Edinburgh, to call at Mr Braidwood, and inquire into the truth of what he had wrote him : he did fo ; converfed with Mr Braid¬ wood, faw the young lady, heard her read, (peak, and anfwer any queftion he put to her.

About this time the father died j and the mother fent an uncle and coufin of the deaf lady’s from Shrewfbury, in order to be fatisfied of the truth. When they arrived, Mr Braid¬ wood told the girl her uncle and coufin were in the parlour j and defired her to go and alk them how they did, and how her mother and other friends did.

In this way he was enabled to alcertain the qualities of any colour, by making an ana- lyfis of the ingredients of which it was compoled. By means of the proofs which were invented by this ingeni¬ ous ehemift, as much of a colour which w^as not of a du¬ rable nature, could be difeharged in a ferv minutes, as would be loll by the adfion ot the air and light in twelve or fifteen days. But as general rules framed for fuch trials are liable to many exceptions, from different un¬ avoidable caufes, their application in many cafes may be confidered as too fevere. For inflance, light co¬ lours require lefs adlive proofs than thofe which are of a deeper dye, and are more loaded with colouring matter ; in the latter cafe, a confiderable proportion of colouring fubflance may be carried off without much vifible change on the colour 5 but in the former, by means of the fame a£Hve tefl, the colour would be en¬ tirely obliterated. Every variety of ihade, therefore, would have required a feparate proof. The fun and the air mud always be confidered as the true left } and thofe colours which undergo no change in a certain time by this expofure, may be confidered permanent colours, although they may be greatly changed by the application of proofs. Scarlet, which is dyed with co¬ chineal alone, affumes a purple colour when tried by means of alum : but if fcarlet be expofed to the fun, it lofes fume of its brightnefs, and becomes of a deeper {hade ; but this fhade is different from that which is- produced by alum.

About the middle of the fixth century, two monks returned from India to Conftantinople, and brought with them a confiderable number of filk- worms, with inftruffions for managing and breeding them, as well as for colleffing, preparing, and manu¬ facturing the filk. Eftablifhments were thus formed at Corinth, Athens, and other parts of Greece. The crufades, which greatly contributed to the diffiufion of different kinds of knowledge, by the intercourfe which took place between different countries, proved ufeful in diffeminating the knowledge of rearing the filk- worm, and preparing and manufacturing its valuable productions. Roger, king of Sicily, about the year 1130, returning from one of thefe frantic expeditions, brought with him from Athens and Corinth, feveral prifoners, who were acquainted with the management of filk-worms, and the manufacturing of filk. Under their fuperintendance, manufactories were tftablifhed at Palermo and Cagliari in Sicily. This example was toon adopted, and followed in different parts of Italy and Spain.

It was, however, long before known as a dye in India. The firft indigo which was employed for the purpofe of dyeing by Europeans, was brought by the Dutch from India. One of the fpecies of the plant from which it is obtained, was difcovered by the Portuguefe in Brazil, where it grows fpontane- oufly, as well as in other parts of America.

"Another fpecies W’hich is a fmaller plant, is alfo employed in dyeing. The ifatis tinBona is cultivated in France and in England. When the plant has reached maturity, it is cut down, walked in a river, and fpeedily dried in the fun. It is then ground in a mill, and reduced into a pafte, which is formed into heaps, covered up to protect them from the rain, and at the end of a fortnight, the heap is opened to mix the whole well together. It is afterwards formed into round balls, which are expofed to the wind and fun, that the moiflure may be feparated. The balls are heaped upon one another, become gradually hot, and exhale the fmell of ammonia. To promote the fer¬ mentation, which is ftronger in proportion to the quantity heaped up, and the temperature of the foafon, the heap is to be fprinkled with water till it falls down in the (late of coarfe powder, in which (late it appears in commerce.

"EADMERUS, an efteemed hiftorian, was an Eng- lilhman ; but his parents, and the particular time and place of his nativity, are not known. He received a learned education, and very early difcovered a tafle for hiftory, by recording every remarkable event that came to his knowledge. Being a monk in the cathe¬ dral of Canterbury, he. had the happinefs to become the bofom friend and infeparable companion of two arehbilhops of that fee, St Anfelm and his fucceflbr Ralph. To the former of thefe he was appointed fpiritual diredfor by the pope •, and that prelate would do nothing without his permiffion. In the year 1120, he was fent for by King Alexander I. of Scotland, to be raifed to the primacy of that kingdom ; and hav¬ ing obtained leave of King Henry and the arch- bilhop of Canterbury, he departed for Scotland, where he was kindly received by the king •, and on the third day after his arrival, he was eledfed bilhop of St An¬ drew’s with much unanimity. But on the day after his eledlion, an unfortunate difpute arofe between the king and him, in a private conference about his con- fecration. Eadmerus having been a conftant compa¬ nion of the late and of the prefent archbilhop of Can¬ terbury, was a violent ftickler for the prerogatives of that fee. He therefore told the king, that he was determined to be confecrated by none but the archbi¬ lhop of Canterbury, who he believed to be the pri¬ mate of all Britain. Alexander, who was a fierce prince, and fupported the independency of his crown and kingdom with great fpirit, was fo much offended, that he broke off the conference in a violent paffion, declaring, that the fee of Canterbury had no pre-emi- nency over that of St Andrew’s. This breach be¬ tween the king and the bilhop-eleft became daily wider, till at length Eadmerus, defpairing of recover¬ ing the royal favour, fent his paftoral ring to the king, and laid his paftoral ftaff on the high altar, from whence he had taken it, and abandoning his bi- Ihopric returned to England. He was kindly re¬ ceived by the archbilhop and clenry of Canterbury, though they difapproved of his ftitfaefs, and thought him too hafty in forfaking the honourable ftation to which he had been called. Nor was it long before Eadmerus became fenfible of his error, and defirous of corre&ing it. With this view he wrote a long fubmiflive letter to the king of Scotland, entreating his leave to return to his bifhopric, promifing compli¬ ance with his royal pleafure in every thing refpe<51ing his confecration, which was accompanied by an epiftle to the fame purpofe from the archbilhop.

"EDDA, in antiquities, is a fyftem of the ancient Icelandic or Runic mythology, containing many cu¬ rious particulars of the theology, philofophy, and manners, of the northern nations of Europe; or of the Scandinavians, who had migrated from Afia, and from whom our Saxon anceftors were defcended. Mr Mallet apprehends that it was originally compiled, foon after the Pagan religion was aboliftied, as a courfe of poetical lectures, for the ufe of fuch young Ice¬ landers as devoted themfelves to the profeflion of a fcald or poet. It confifts of two principal parts ; the JirJl containing a brief fyftem of mythology, properly, called the Edda ; and the fecond being a kind of art of poetry, and called fcalda or poetics. The moft ancient Edda was compiled by Soemund Sigfuffon, furnam- ed the Learned, who was born in Iceland about the year 1057. This was abridged, and rendered more eafy and intelligible, about 120 years afterwards, by Snorro Sturlefon, who was fupreme judge of Iceland in the years 1215 and 1222; and it was publifhed in the form of a dialogue. He added alfo the fecond part in the form of a dialogue, being a detail of dif¬ ferent events tranfa£led among the divinities. The only three pieces that are known to remain of the more ancient Edda of Soemund, are the Volupfa, the Hava- maal, and the Runic chapter. The Volupfa, or pro¬ phecy of Vola or Fola, appears to be the text, on which the Edda is the comment. It contains, in two or three hundred lines, the whole fyftem of mythology difclofed in the Edda, and may be compared to the Sibylline verfes, on account of its laconic yet bold ftyle, and its imagery and obfcurity. It is profeffedly a re¬ velation of the decrees of the Father of nature, and the aftions and operations of the gods. It defcribes the chaos, the formation of the world, with its various inhabitants, the functions of the gods, their moft fignal adventures, their quarrels with Loke their great ad- verfary, and the vengeance that enfued j and con¬ cludes with a long defcription of the final ftate of the univerfe, its diffolution and conflagration, the battle of the inferior deities and the evil beings, the renova¬ tion of the world, the happy lot of the good, and the punifhment of the wicked. The Havamaal, or Sub¬ lime Difcourfe, is attributed to the god Odin, who is fuppofed to have given thefe precepts of wifdom to mankind j it is comprifed in about 120 ftanzas, and re- fembles the book of Proverbs. Mr Mallet has given fe¬ veral extrafts of this treatife on the Scandinavian ethics",,IS,5,Iceland,Europe
"Goranfon. The Latin verfion is printed as a fupple- ment to M. Mallet’s Northern Antiquities. The firft edition of the Edda was publifhed by Refenius, pro- feffor at Copenhagen, in a large quarto volume, in the year E D E . [ 5 :j(]a year 1665 j containing the text of the Edda, a Latin 'll tranflation by an Icelandic pried, a Danilh verfion, •linck. anj various readings from different MSS. M. Mallet y has alfo given an Englirti tranllation of the firft part, accompanied with remarks; from which we learn, that the Edda teaches the doddrine of the Supreme, called the Un iv erf a l Father, and Odin, who lives forever, go¬ verns all his kingdom, and directs the great things as well as the fmall ; who formed the heaven, earth, and air; made man, and gave him a fpirit or foul, which {hall live after the body fliall have mouldered away ; and then all the juft fhall dwell with him in a place Gimle or Vingof the palace of friendthip ; but wicked men (hall go to Hela,or death, and from thence to Niflheim, or the abode of the wicked, which is below in the ninth world. It inculcates alfo the belief of fevcral inferior gods and goddeffes, the chief of whom is Frigga or Frea, h e. lady, meaning hereby the earth, who was the fpoufe of Odin or the Supreme God ; whence we may infer that, according to the opinion of thefe ancient philofophers, this Odin was the active prin¬ ciple or foul of the world, which uniting itfelf with matter, had thereby put it into a condition to pro¬ duce the intelligences or inferior gods, and men and all other creatures. The Edda likewifes teaches the exigence of an evil being called Lake, the calumnia¬ tor of the gods, the artificer of fraud, who furpaiTes all other beings in cunning and perfidy. It teaches the creation of all things out of an abyfs or chaos ; the final deftrmffion of the world by fire ; the abforp- tion of the inferior divinities, both good and bad, into the bofom of the grand divinity, from whom all things proceeded, as emanations of his effence, and who will furvive all things; and the renovation of the earth in an improved ftate","Copenhagen, Un","DK,IN",5,"Denmark,India","Europe,Asia"

"The year 143713 remarkable for the execution of Cruel 1 the earl of Athol and his accomplices, who had a con-cutIoni cern in the murder of James I.

"gin of By the overthrow of James IV. at the battle of town Flowden, the city of Edinburgh was overwhelmed ln*' with grief and confufion, that monarch having been attended in his unfortunate expedition by the earl of Angus, then provoft, with the reft of the magiftrates, and a number of the principal inhabitants, moft of whom perifhed in the battle. After this difafter, the inhabitants being alarmed for the fafety of their city, it was enabled that every fourth man ftiould keep watch at night ; the fortifications of the town were renewed, the wall being alfo extended in fuch a man¬ ner as to enclofe the Grafsmarket, and the field on which Heriot’s Hofpital, the Grey Friars Church, and Charity Workhoufe, Hand. On the eaft fide it was made to enclofe the College, Infirmary, and High School ; after which, turning to the north, it met the old wall at the Netherbow port. After this alarm was over, the inhabitants were gradually relieved from the trouble of watching at night, and a certain number of militia appointed to prevent difturbances ; who con¬ tinue to this day, and are known by the name of the Town Guard. Before thefe new enclofures, moft of the principal people lived in the Cowgate without the wall; and the burying place was fituated where the EDI Parliament Clofe now is. In our days of peace, when Edinburgh, no alarm of an enemy is at all probable, great part of ——y— the walls, with all the gates, have been taken down, and the city laid quite open, in order to afford more ready paffage to the great concourfe of people with whom the ftreet is daily filled.

So great was the quantity at that time, however, that it was enadted by the town council, that whoever inclined to purchafe as much wood as was fufficient to make a new front for their koufe, might extend it feven feet into the ftreet. Thus the city was in a (hort time filled with houfes of wood inftead of ftone j by which, befides the inconvenience of ha¬ ving the ftreet narrowed 14 feet, and the beauty of the whole entirely marred, it became much more lia¬ ble to accidents by fire : but almoft all thefe are now pulled down 5 and in doing this a fingular tafte in the mafonry which fupported them is faid to have been dif- covered. 9 In 1542, a war with England having commenced Edinburgh through the treachery of Cardinal Beaton, an Engliffi cleHroyecI fleet of 200 fail entered the Forth j and having landed ^7 their forces, quickly made themfelves mailers of the 'a towns of Leith and Edinburgh.

"Soon after this, the fpirit of fanaticifm, which fuc- ceeded the Keformation, produced violent commotions, not only in Edinburgh, but through the whole king¬ dom. The foundation of thefe diffurbances, and in¬ deed of moft others which have ever happened in Chri- flendom on account of religion, was that pernicious maxim of Popery, that the church is independent of the ftate. It is not to be fuppofed that this maxim xvas at all agreeable to the fovereign ; but fucb was the attachment of the people to the doctrines of the clergy, that King James found himfelf obliged to com¬ pound matters with them. This, however, anfwered the 11 purpofe but very indifferently 5 and at laft a violent up- ?he Cltyf roar was excited. The king was then fitting in the difpleafure court of which was held in the tolbooth, of Janies when a petition was prefented to him by fix perfons, lamenting the dangers which threatened religion 5 and being treated with very little refpeeft by one Bruce, a minifter, his majefty afked who they were that dared to convene againft his proclamation ? He was anfwer¬ ed by Lord Lindfay, that they dared to do more, and would not fuffer religion to be overthrown. On this the king perceiving a number of people crowding in¬ to the room, withdrew into another without making any reply, ordering the door to be fhut. By this the petitioners were fo much enraged, that on their return to the church the moft furious refolutions were taken ; and had it not been for the aftivity of Sir Alexander Home the provoft, and Mr Watt the deacon convener, who affembled the crafts in his majefly’s behalf, it is more than probable that the door would have been forced, and an end put to his life. This affront was fo much refented by the king, that he thought proper to declare Edinburgh an unfit place of refidence for the court or the adminiftration of juftiee. In confequence 5 ] EDI of this declaration, he commanded the college of juft ice, jy , the inferior judges, and the nobility and barons, to JaJ retire from Edinburgh, and not to return without ex- prefs licenfe. This unexpected declaration threw the whole town into conftemalion, and brought back the magiftrates and principal inhabitants to a ft ufe of their duly. With the clergy it was far otherwife. They railed againft the king in the moft furious manner, and endeavouring to perfuade the people to take up arms, the magiftrates were ordered to imprilbn them ; but they elcaped by a timely flight. A de¬ putation of the moft refpe£!able burgelfes was then lent to the king at Linlithgow, with a view to miti¬ gate his refentment. But he refufed to be pacified j and on the laft day of December 1596 entered the town between two rows of his foldiers who lined the ftreets, while the citizens were commanded to keep within their houfes. A convention of the eliates was held in the tolbooth, before whom the magiftrates made the moft abje£t fubmiflions, but in vain. The convention declared one of the late tumults, in which an attack had been made upon the king’s perfon, to be high treafon ; and ordained, that if the magiftrates did not find out the authors, the city itfelf ftiould be lubjeifted to all the penalties due to that crime. It was even propofed to raze the town to the foundation, and eredt a pillar on the fpot where it had flood, as a mo¬ nument of its crimes. The inhabitants were now re¬ duced to the utmoft defpair ; but Queen Elizabeth in- terpoling in behalf of the city, the king thought pro¬ per to abate fomewhat of his rigour. A criminal profecution, however, was commenced, and the town council were commanded to appear at Perth by the firft of February.

"The populace and their leaders were fo much enraged by the latter, that Lord Traquair and fome of the bi- ffiops narrowly efcaped with their lives; and next year (1638) matters became dill more ferious. For now, the king having provoked his fubje&s throughout all Scotland with the innovations he attempted in religion, Edinburgh was made the general place of rendezvous, and the mod formidable affociations took place ; an account of which has already been given under the ar¬ ticle Britain. Each of the towns in Scotland had a copy ; and that which belonged to Edinburgh, crowd¬ ed with 5000 names, is dill preferved among the records of the city. Notwithdanding this difagree- roent, however, the king once more vifited Edinburgh in 1641, and was entertained by the magidrates at an expence of 12,0001. Scots. It does not appear that af¬ ter this the city was in any way particularly concerned with the didurbances which followed either through¬ out the remainder of the reign of Charles I. the com¬ monwealth, or the reign of Charles II.

On the night previous to the day that had been appointed for his exe¬ cution, therefore, a number of people affembled, Hurt the gates of the city, and burnt the door of the prifon, the fame which the mob would formerly have broken open in order to murder King James. They then took out Porteous, whom it was found impoffible to refeue out of their hands, though every method that the magi- ftrates could take for that purpofe in fuch a confufion was made ufe of. It was even proved that the member of parliament went to the commander in chief, and re- quefted that he would fend a party of foldiers to quell the difturbance, but was abfolutely denied this requeft, becaufe he could not produce a written order from the provoft to this purport •, which, in the confufion then ex- ifting in the city, could neither have been expefted to be given by the provoft, nor would it have been fafe for any perfon to have carried it about him. Thus the un¬ happy vi£Km was left in the hands of his executioners, and being dragged by them to the place deftined for receiving his fate, was hanged on a dyer’s fign poft.

"All the efforts of government, however, were infuffi- cient to produce any difeovery j. by which, no doubt, the court was ftill more exafperated j and it was now determined to execute vengeance on the magiftrates and city at large.

This gave occafion to an order to the guard at the Weigh-houfe, to prevent all intercourfe between the city and caftle $ and then the governor acquainted the provoft by letter, that unlefs the com¬ munication was preferved, he would be obliged to dif- lodge the guard by means of artillery.

"Tumults have been frequent in Edinburgh, chiefly on account of the dearnefs of provifions. In 1740 Bell’s mills were firft attacked by the populace, and afterwards Leith mills ; nor could the rioters be difperfed till the military had fired among them and wounded three, of whom one died *, and it was found neceflary to order fome dragoons into the city in order to preferve tran¬ quillity. In 1742, another violent tumult took place, owing to a cuftom of ftealing dead bodies from their graves for anatomical purpofes, which had then become common. The populace beat to arms, threatened deftruc* tion to the furgeons $ and, in fpite of the efforts of the magiftrates, demolifhed the houfe of the beadle at St Cuthbert’s. In 1756 new difturbances, which required the afliftance of the military, took place : the caufe at this time was the impreffing of men for the war which was then commencing. A difturbance was likewife ex¬ cited in 1760. This was occafioned by the footmen, who till then were allowed to follow their matters into the play houfe, and now took upon them to difturb the en¬ tertainment of the company ; the confequence of which was, that they were turned out, and have ever fince been obliged to wait for their mafters. In 1763 and 1765, the tumults on account of the price of provi- fions were renewed ; many of the mealmongers had their houfes broken open and their {hops deftroyed","Edinburgh, Bell","GB,US",5,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"Since that time there have been no tumults direftly on the account of provifions •, though in 1784 a terrible riot and attack of a diftillery at Canonmills took place, on a fuppofition that the diftillers enhanced the price of meal by ufing unmalted grain.

"In the years 1778 and 1779 two very alarming, di¬ fturbances happened, which threatened a great deal of bloodihed, though happily they were terminated with¬ out any. The firft was a mutiny of the earl of Sea~ forth’s Highland regiment, who were at this time quar¬ tered in the caftle. Thefe having been ordered to em¬ bark, for fome reafon or other unanimoufly refufed, and potted themfelves on the top of Arthur’s feat, where they continued for two days. Troops were colle&ed to prevent their efcape, and the inhabitants were ordered to keep within doors at the firft toll of the great bell, which was to be a fignal of violence about to take place ; but fortunately all the fears, naturally arifing from the expectation of this event, were diflipated by an accommodation. The other happened on account of the attempt to repeal the penal laws againft the Papifts; and was much more alarming than the other, as being the eflFeCl of a premeditated fcheme and determined re- folution to oppofe government. On the fecond of Febru¬ ary 1779 a mob afiembled in the evening, burned a Popilh chapel, and plundered another. Next day they renewed their depredations.; deftroying and carrying off the books, furniture, &c. of feveral Popifli priefts and others of that perfuafion. The riot continued all that day, though the affiftance of the military was called in ; but happily no lives were loft, nor was there any firing. The city was afterwards obliged to make good the damage fuftained by the Catholics on this occafion, which was eftimated at 1500I. This year alfo an unlucky accident happened at Leith. About 50 Highland recruits having refufed to embark, a par¬ ty of the South Fencibles was fent to take them pri- foners. Unexpectedly, however, the Highlanders flood upon their defence; when, after fome words, a firing commenced on both fides, and about one half of the Highlanders were killed and wounded, the remainder being taken prifoners and carried to the caftle.

Thefe began in the year^0^6 1753, when the foundation-ftone of the Exchange was laid, at which time there was a grand proceflion, and the greateft concourfe of people ever known in Edinburgh. A triumphal areh ivas ereCled for the purpofe, through which the proceffion patted, and me¬ dals were feattered among the populace. In 1756 the high ftreet was cleared by the removal of the crofs; though many regretted this, on account of its being a very ancient and elegant building. In the middle it had an unicorn placed on the top of a pillar 20 feet high ; but this fine ornament was broken to pieces by the giving way of the tackle by which it was attempt¬ ed to remove it. It is now again ereCled at Drum, a feat formerly belonging to Lord Somerville, about four miles EDI [ s , nburgt. miles from Edinburgh. In 1763 the firft ftone of the Jilorth bridge was laid by Provoft Drummond ; and in 1767 an atl of parliament was obtained for extending the royalty of the city over the fields to the north¬ ward, where the New Town is now fituated. About the fame time a fpot of ground upon the fouth fide of the town was purchafed by a private perfon for 1 200I","Highland, Highland, Mansfield, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh","US,GB",5,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"which being feued out for building, gave rife to the increafe of the town on that quarter *, and this pro¬ ceeded the more rapidly, as the houfes built there were free from the dues impofed upon others fubjedd to the royalty. In 1774 the foundation of the Regifter Of¬ fice was laid. In 1784 the projedd for rendering the accefs to the town equally eafy on both fides was be¬ gun to be put in execution by laying the foundation of the South bridge. At the fame time a great improve¬ ment wyas made by reducing the height of the ftreet feveral feet all the way from the place where the crofs flood to the Netherbow 5 by which means the afcent is rendered more eafy, not only for carriages, but alfo for perfons wdio walk on foot. At the fame time, the ftreet was farther cleared by the removal of the town guard houfe, which had long been complained of as an encumbrance. Within thefe three years (1805) part of the Luckenbooths has been removed, and it is ftill far¬ ther in contemplation to remove the whole with the prifon. When this is accompliftred, with other im¬ provements by which it mult neceflarily be accom¬ panied, it is to be queftioned w hether any city in Bri¬ tain wall be able to vie with Edinburgh in elegance and beauty",Edinburgh,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe

"The fteepnefs of the afcent makes the accefs to the high ftreet from the north and fouth very difficult j which no doubt greatly retarded the enlargement of the city. To remedy this inconvenience on the north, and with a view to extend the town on that quarter, a moft elegant bridge has been thrown over the North Loch, which joins the north ridge to the middle of the high ftreet, by fo eafy an afcent as one in fixteen j and in purfuance of the defign, a plan of a new town to the north was fixed upon, and is now nearly finiffied, with an elegance and tafte that does honour to this country. In like manner, to facilitate the accefs from the fouth fide, a bridge has been thrown over the val¬ ley through which the Cowgate runs j which, if not equally elegant with the North bridge, is certainly as convenient. 26 The gradual increafe of the city of Edinburgh may Account of^ in fome degree be underftood from the traces of its an- t^graduab cient walls that ftill remain.

"When the city was firit fortified, the wall reached no further than the prefent water-houfe, or refervoir, on the caftle hill: from thence to the foot of Halker - fton’s wynd, juft below the new bridge, the city was defended by the North Loch j an inconfiderable morals, which, being formerly overflowed, formed a fmall lake that hath fince been drained. From this place to the foot of Leith wynd, it does not appear how the city was fortified ? but from the foot of Leith wynd to the Nether-bow port it was defended only by a range of houfes j and wffien thefe had became ruinous, a wall wras built in their place. The original wall of Edinburgh, therefore, began at the foot of the north-ealt rock ol the caftle. Here it was ftrengthened by a fmall fortrefs, the ruins of which are ftill to be feen, and are called the Weil-houfe Tower, from their having a fpring in their neighbourhood. When the wrall came oppolite to the refervoir, it was carried quite acrofs the hill, having a gate on the top for making a communication between the towm and caftle. In going down the hill, it went flanting in an oblique direction to the firft angle m going down the Weft-bow, where was a gate, named the Upper-bow Port, one of the hooks of which ftill remains. Thence it proceeded eaftward in fuch a man¬ ner, as would have cut oft not only all the Cowgate, but fome part of the parliament houfe ; and being con¬ tinued as far as the Mint clofe, it turned to the north- eaft, and connected itfelf with the buildings on the 3 U north EDI [ 522 ] EDI jj^inbnrgfi. north iide of the high ftreet, where was the original w—y——' Nether-bow Port, about 50 yards well from that which afterwards went by the fame name",Edinburgh,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe

That in the upper or Weft-bow flood for a much longer time, and was pulled down -within the memory of fome perfons lately or perhaps flill living.

"For 250 years the city of Edinburgh occupied the fame fpace of ground, and it is but very lately that its limits have been fo confiderably enlarged. In the middle of the 16th century, it is defcribed as extending in length about an Italian mile, and about half as much in breadth 3 which anfwers very nearly to its prefent limits, the late enlargements only excepted. This fpace of ground, however, was not at that time occupied in the manner it is at prefent. The houfes were neither fo high nor fo crowded upon each other as they are now",Edinburgh,"GB,IT",5,"United Kingdom,Italy","Europe,Europe"
"In the middle of the laft century, there were nei¬ ther courts nor fquares in Edinburgh. The Parlia¬ ment clofe or fquare is the oldeft of this kind in the city. Miln’s fquare, James’s court, &c. were built long after ; and Argyll’s and Brown’s fquares about the years 1750 or 1760. ^ The vVeru Town was projefted in the year 1752; New but as the magiftrates could not then procure an ex-Town, tenfion of the royalty, the execution of the defign was fufpended for fome time. In 1767, an aft was ob¬ tained, by which the royalty was extended over the fields to the northward of the city 3 upon which ad* vertifements were publilhed by the magiftrates, de¬ firing proper plans to be given in. Plans were given in accordingly, and that defigned by Mr James Craig architeft was adopted. Immediately afterwards, peo¬ ple were invited to purchafe lots from the town coun¬ cil 3 and fuch as purchafed became bound to conform to the rules of the plan. In the mean time, however, the town council had fecretly referved to themfelves a privilege of departing from their own plan 3 which they afterwards made ufe of in fuch a manner as pro¬ duced a law fuit. According to the plan held forth , to the purchafers, a canal was to be made through that place EDI [ 523 ] EDI ! jr ,burgh- place where the North Loch had been, and the bank on w. -v——1 the north fi.de of it laid out in terraces : but inftead of this, by an a61 of council, liberty was referved to the town to build upon this fpot j and therefore, when many gentlemen had built genteel houfes in the new town on faith of the plan, they were furprifed to find the fpot appointed for terraces and a canal, beginning to be covered with mean irregular buildings, and work houfes for tradefmen. This deviation was im¬ mediately complained of} but as the magiftrates Ihow- ed no inclination to grant any redrefs, a profecution was commenced againft them before the Lords of Sef- fion. In that court the caufe was given agamft the purfuers, who thereupon appealed to the Houfe of Lords. Here the fentence of the Court of Seflion was reverfed, and the caufe remitted to the confideration of their Lordfhips. At laft, after an expenfive con- teft, matters were accommodated. The principal term of accommodation was, that fome part of the ground was to be laid out in terraces and a canal; but the time of difpofing it in that manner, was refer¬ red to the Lord Prefident of the Court of Seflion and the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The fall of part of the bridge, hereafter mentioned, proved a Very confiderable difadvantage to the New Town $ as it neceflarily induced a fufpicion that the paffage, by means of the bridge, could never be rendered fafe",Edinburgh,GB,5,United Kingdom,Europe
"An overfight of the magiftrates proved of more effen- tial detriment. A piece of ground lay to the fouth- ward of the Old Town, in a fituation very proper for building. This the magiftrates had an opportunity of purchafing for 1200I j which, however, they ne- gledled, and it was bought by a private perfon, who immediately feued it out in lots for building, as has been already mentioned. The magiftrates then began to fee the confequence, namely, that this fpot being free from the duties to which the royalty of Edinburgh is fubje61, people wTould choofe to refide there rather than in the New Town.

"Entertainments of the dramatic kind came very early into fafliion in this country. They were at firft only reprefentations of religious fubje&s, and peculiarly de¬ figned to advance the intererts of religion ; the clergy being the compofers, and Sunday the principal time of exhibition.. In the 16th century, the number of play- houfes was fo great, that it was complained of as a nui- fance, not only in Edinburgh, but throughout the kingdom. They foon degenerated from their original inftitution ‘7 and the plays, inftead of being calculated to infpire devotion, became filled with all manner of buffoonery and indecency.—After the Reformation, the Prefbyterian clergy complained of thefe indecencies j and being a£luated by a fpirit of violent zeal, anathe- matifed every kind of theatrical reprefentation what¬ ever. King James VI. compelled them to pal's from their cenfures againft the ftage y but in the time of Charles I. when fanaticifm was carried to the utmoft length at which perhaps it was poffible for it to arrive, it cannot be fuppofed that ftage plays would be tolera¬ ted.—It feems, however, that amufemen-ts of this kind were again introduced at Edinburgh about the year 1684, when the duke of York kept his court there. His refidence at Edinburgh drew off one half of the London company, and plays were a bled in E- dinburgh for fome little time.. 1'he misfortunes at¬ tending the duke of York, however, and the eftabliffi- ment of the Prefbyterian religion (the genius of which is unfavourable to amufements of this kind), foon put a flop to the progrefs of the ftage, and no theatrical exhibition was heard of in Edinburgh till after the year 1715. The firft adventurer was Signora Violante, an Italian, remarkable for feats of ftrength, tumbling, &c. In this way ffie fi^l exhibited in a houfe at the foot of Carruber’s clofe, which has fince been employ¬ ed by different fe&aries for religious purpofes. Meet¬ ing with good fuccefs, ftie foon invited a company of comedians from London j and thefe being alfo well received, Edinburgh continued for fome years to be entertained with the performances of a ftrolling com¬ pany, who vifited it annually. Becoming at laft, how¬ ever, obnoxious to the clergy, they were in I727 prohibited by the magiftrates from ailing within their jurifdiftion. But this interdift was fulpended by the court of fefiion, and the players continued to perform as ufual","Edinburgh, Edinburgh, York, London, York, Edinburgh, London, Edinburgh","GB,US,IT",5,"United Kingdom,United States,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Still, however, theatrical amufements were but rare.. The town was vifited by itinerant companies only once in two or three years. They performed in the Taylor’s Hall in theCanongate 5 which, when the jboufe was full, would have drawn (at the rate of 2s. 6d, for pit and boxes, and is. 6d. for the gallery) 40I. or Ed 45I. a night. About this time an aft of parliament was paffed, prohibiting the exhibition of plays, except in a houfe licenfed by the king. Of this the prefby- tery of Edinburgh immediately laid hold j and at their own expence brought an aftion on the ftatute againll the players. The caufe was by the court of feffion decided againft the players j who thereupon applied to parliament for a bill to enable his majefty to licenfe a theatre in Edinburgh. Againft this bill petitions were presented in 1739 to the houfe of commons by the magiftrates and town council, the principal and pro- feffors of the univerfity, and the dean of guild and his council; in confequence of which, the affair was drop-* ped.. All this oppofition, however, contributed in reality to the fuccefs of the players j for the fpirit of party being excited, a way of evading the aft was ea- fily found out, and the houfe was frequented more than ufual, in&much that Taylor’s Hall was found in-: fufficient to contain the number of fpeftators","Taylor, Of, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Taylor","US,GB,TR",5,"United States,United Kingdom,Turkey","North America,Europe,Asia"
"The comedians now fell out among themfelves, and a new plavhoufe was erefted in the Canongate in the year 1746. The confequence of this was, that the old one in Taylor’s Hall became entirely deferted, and through bad conduft the managers of the new theatre foon found themfelves greatly involved. At laft, a riot enfuing through diffenfions among the performers, the play houfe was totally demoliftied.—When the extenfion of the royalty over the fpot where the New Town is built was obtained, a claufe was likewife added to the bill, enabling his majefty to licenfe a theatre in Edin¬ burgh. This was obtained, and thus the oppofition of the clergy for ever filenced. But notwithftanding this, the high price paid by the managers to the pa¬ tentee, being no lefs than 500 guineas annually, pre¬ vented them effeftually from decorating the houfe as they would otherwife have done, or even from always retaining good aftors in their fervice •, by which means the fuccefs of the Edinburgh theatre has not been fo great as might have been expefted^ Not far from this building, an amphitheatre was opened in 1790, on the road to Leith, for equeftrian exhibitions, pantomime entertainments, dancing, and tumbling.

We have formerly taken notice of one circumftance in favour of a claflical education, to which it may be wards^flie0"" ProPer *0 reca^ *be attention of our readers. We ob- improve ferved, that the cultivation of claflical learning has a merit of favourable influence on the living languages. It has our mother a tendency to preferve their purity from being debaf- tongue. ancj ^eir analogy from becoming irregular. In ftudying the dead languages, we find it neceffary to pay more attention to the principles of grammar than in acquiring our mother tongue. We learn our native language without attending much to its analogy and ftrufture. Of the numbers who fpeak Englifh through the Britifh dominions, but few are Ikilled in the in¬ flexion of its nouns and verbs, or able to diftinguilh between adverbs and conjunXions. Defirous only of making their meaning underflood, they are not anxi¬ ous about purity or correXnefs of fpeech. They re- jeX not an exprtflion which occurs to them, becaufe it is barbarous or ungrammatical. As they grew up they learned to fpeak from their mothers, their nurfes and others about them •, they were foon able to make known their wants, their willies, and their obferva- 66 Utility of claflical themfelves in their mother tongue without acquiring any accurate knowledge of its general principles. If thefe people find occafion to exprefs themfelves in writing, they, are fcarce more ftudious of correXnefs and elegance in writing than in fpeaking 5 or, though they may afpire after thofe properties, yet they can never attain them. But fuch writers or fpeakers can never refine any language* or reduce it to a regular analogy. Neither can they be expeXed to diftinguilh themfelves as the guardians of the purity and regularity of their native tongue, if it fliould before have attained a high degree of per- feXion. But they who, in learning a language dif¬ ferent from their native tongue, have found it necef¬ fary to pay particular attention to the principles of grammar, afterwards apply the knowledge of grammar which they have thus acquired in ufing their mother tongue j and by that means become better acquainted with its ftruXure, and learn to write and fpeak it with more correXnefs and propriety. Befides, the lan¬ guages of Greece and Rome are lo highly diftinguilh- ed for their eopioufnefs, their regular analogy, and for various other excellencies, which render them fu- perior to even the chief of modern languages, that the ftudy of them has a natural tendency to improve and enrich modern languages. If we look backwards to the 15th century, when learning began to revive in Europe, and that fpecies of learning which began firft to be cultivated was claflical literature, we find that almoft all the languages then fpoken in Europe were wretchedly poor and barbarous. Knowledge could not be communicated, nor bufinefs tranfaXed, without- calling in the aid of Latin. Claflical learning, how¬ ever, foon came to be cultivated by all ranks with en- thufiaftic eagernefs. Not only thofe defigned to pur- fue a learned profeflion, and men of fortune whofe ob- jeX was a liberal education without a view to any par¬ ticular profefiion j but even the lower ranks, and the female fex, keenly ftudied the languages and the wif¬ dom of Greece and Rome. This avidity for claflical learning was followed by many happy effeXs. But its influence was chiefly remarkable in producing an ama¬ zing change on the form of the living languages. Thefe foon became more copious and regular j and many of them have confequently attained fuch perfeXion, that the poet, the hiftorian, and the philofopher, can clothe their thoughts in them to the greatefl advantage., Cou!d vve derive no new advantage from the ftudy of the ancient languages, yet would they be worthy of our care, as having contributed fo much to raife the modern languages to their prefent improved ftate. But they can alfo conduce to the prefervation and fupport of thofe noble ftruXures which have been reared by their afliftance. The intercourfe of nations, the afiec- tation of writers, the gradual introduXion of provin¬ cial barbariftns, and various other caufes, have a ten¬ dency to corrupt and debale even the nobleft languages^ By fuch means were the languages of Greece and Rome gradually corrupted, till the language uled by a Horace, a Livy, a Xenophon, and a Menander, was loft in a jargon unfit for the purpofes of compofition","Of, Rome, Rome, Rome","GR,US,TR",5,"Greece,United States,Turkey","Europe,North America,Asia"

"Books were then fcarce, and thofe few which were to be obtained were no very rich treafuries of ufe- ful information. The rhapfodies of a poet, the rude legends of fome ill-informed and fabulous hiftorian, or the theories of fanciful philofophers, were all that they could afford. Thales, Lycurgus, Solon, Plato, tra¬ velled, feeking that knowledge among more civilized nations which they could not find in their native coun¬ try. In the courfe of their travels, they heard the lec¬ tures of celebrated philofophers ; confulted the priefts, who were the guardians of the traditions of antiquity, concerning the nature and origin of thofe traditions ; and obferved the inftitutions of thofe nations which were moft renowned for the wifdom of their legifia- ture. When they fet out to vifit foreign countries, they feemed to have propofed to themfelves a certain end ; and by keeping that end fteadily in view during the courfe of their travels, they gained fuch improve¬ ment as to be able on their return to command the veneration of their countrymen by means of the know¬ ledge which they were enabled to communicate. Many befides the philofophers of ancient Greece have tra¬ velled for improvement, and have fucceeded in their views.

But they went thither with the fame views with which our youth in modern times are fent to free fchools and univerfities, not to acquire knowledge by the obfervation of nature, of the inftitutions, manners, and cuftoms of nations j but mere¬ ly to hear leftures, read books, and perform exercifes","Rome, Athens","GR,US",5,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"In modern times, a few men of reflexion and expe¬ rience have now and then travelled for improvement : but the greateft part of our travellers, for a long time, were enthufiaftic devotees who went in pilgrimage to vifit the Ihrine or relics of fome favourite faint ; fol- diers, who wandered over the earth to deftroy its in¬ habitants *, or merchants, whofe bufinefs as fa&ors be¬ tween widely diftant countries and nations led them to brave every danger in traverfing from one corner of the globe to another. But fince the nations of modern Europe have begun to emerge from rudenefs, igno¬ rance, and fervile depreffion, they have formed one great commonwealth, the members of which are fcarce lefs intimately conneifted with each other than were the ftates of ancient Greece. The confequence of this mutual connexion and dependence is, that almoft all the nations of Europe have frequent intercourfe with one another ; and as fome of them are, and have long been, more enlightened and refined than others, thofe na¬ tions who have attained the higheft degree of civiliza- E D U tion and refinement have naturally attra&ed the admira- Education, tion and homage of the reft.

Hence has arifen the practice which at prefent prevails among us of fending our youth to complete their education by travelling, before we introduce them to a£tive life, or require them to engage in bufinefs. Formerly young men were not fent to travel till after they had proceed¬ ed through the forms of a regular education, and had at leaft attained fuch an age that they were no longer to be confidered as mere boys. But the progrefs of luxury, the defire of parents to introduce their child¬ ren into the world at an early age, that.they may early attain to wealth and honours, and various other caufes, have gradually introduced the practice of fending mere boys to foreign countries, under pretence of affording them opportunities of (baking off prejudices, of ftoring their minds with truly uftful knowledge, and of acquiring thofe graceful manners and that manly ad- drefs which will enable them to acquit themfelves in a becoming manner when they are called to the duties of aflive life.

"After receiving a very iruperfefl education, in which religious and moral inftruftion are almoft wholly ne- glefted, and no means are ufed to infpire the youth¬ ful m;nd with folid, virtuous, manly qualities; but every art is tried to make the young man appear learn¬ ed, while his mind is deftitute of all ufeful information, and to teach him to affume the confidence of manhood before he has attained even to a moderate degree of fenfe and prudence *,—alter an education conduced in this manner, and with thefe views, the llripling is font abroad to view the world, and is expect'd to re¬ turn home a finilhed cbara£ler, an ornament and a comfort to his parents and all his connexions. He is hitherto unacquainted, perhaps, even with the fimple events of the hidory of his native country ; and either totally ignorant of clailical literature, or but very fu- perficially inltru£ted in it. He has not yet viewed with a difcerning eye the manners and cuftoms pre¬ vailing among his countrymen j he knows not the na¬ ture of the government under which he lives, nor the fpirit of thofe laws by which his civil condudl muft be regulated. He has no fixed principles ; no clear, di- flindt views.

"00 Much has been faid concerning the utility of a 0 hippy knowledge of the world, and the advantage of acqui-effects of ring it at an early period of life. But thofe who have the mod earneflly recommended this knowledge of the tion int() world, have generally explained themlelves in fo inac-the world.• curate a manner concerning it, that it is difficult to underdand what ideas they affix to it. They feem. to wiffi, E D U [ 5§2 ] E D W Education, wiflv, that, in order to acquire it, young people may '“■““Y—be early made acquainted with all the vices and follies of the world, introduced into polite company, carried t to public places, and not confined even from the ga¬ ming table and the (lews. Some knowledge of the ■world may, no doubt, be gained by thefe means. But it is furely dearly purchafed j nor are the advantages which can be derived from it fo confiderable, as to tempt the judicious and affe&ionate parent to expofe his child to the infe61ion of vanity, folly, and vice, for their fake. Carry a boy or girl into public life at the age of fourteen or fifteen j (how them all the fcenes of fplendid vanity and diffipation which adorn London or Paris j tell them of the importance of drefs, and of the ceremonies of good breeding and the forms of in- tercourfe j teach them that falhionable indifference and affurance which give the ton to the manners of our fine gentlemen and fine ladies of the prefent age. What effects can you expe£t the fcenes into which you intro¬ duce them, and the myfleries which you now teach them, to produce on the minds of the children ? They have a dire£f tendency to infpire them with a tafte for vanity, frivolity, and diffipation. If you wiffi them to be like the foolifh, the diffipated, and the gay, you are likely to obtain your purpofe ; but if, on the con¬ trary, your views are to prepare them for difcharging tne duties of life, you could not adopt more improper means 5 for though they be well acquainted with all thofe things on which you place fo much value, yet they have not thereby gained any acceffion of ufeful knowledge. They are not now more able than before to eftimate the real value of objefts ; nay, their judge¬ ment is now more liable than before to be milled in eftimating the value of the obje&s around them. Lux- ury, vanity, and faffiion, have ftamped on many things an ideal value. By mingling at an early age in thofe icenes of the world where luxury, vanity, and faffiion, reign with arbitrary iway, young people are naturally impreiTed with all thofe prejudices which thefe have a tendency to infpire. Inftead of acquiring an ufeful knowledge of the world, they are rendered incapable of ever viewing the world with an unprejudiced and difcerning eye. If poffible, therefore, we ffiould ra¬ ther labour to confine young people from mingling in the fcenes of gay and diffipated life till after they have attained maturity of age and judgment. They will then view them in a proper light, and perhaps be happy enough to efcape the infetlious contagion of vice","Much, London, Paris","DE,GB,US",5,"Germany,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Dr Nicolas, a perfon of eminence in the phyfical world, and a relation of his mafter’s, happened to die. The Doctor’s books were removed to an apartment occu¬ pied by Edw’ards, who eagerly employed all his leifure hours, both in the day and great part of the night, in perufing thofe which treated of natural hiftory,' fculp- ture, painting, aftronomy, and antiquities. The reading of thefe books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile bufinefs he might have formerly had, and herefolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he vifited moft of the principal towns in Holland, and in about a month returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was difpofed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the mafter of the ffiip in which he em¬ barked. At this time Charles XII. was befieging Fre- derickffiall \ by which means our young naturalift was hindered from making fuch excurfions into the coun¬ try as other wife he could have done, for the Swedes were very careful to confine fuch ftrangers as could not give Educatfoi II Edwards, E D W [ 5S3 1 E D Y } ?ards. g‘ve a g00^ account themfelves. Bat notwithftand- L y—^ ing all his precaution, he was confined by the Danilh guard, who fuppofed him to be a fpy employed by the enemy to get intelligence of their defigns. However, by obtaining tellimonials of his innocence, a releafe was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year vifited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During his flay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each ; the firft to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720 j the fecond on foot, to Orleans and Blois; but an edidl happening at that time to be iffued for fecuring va¬ grants, in order to tranfport them to America, as the banks of the MifliiTippi wanted population j our au¬ thor narrowly efcaped a weftern voyage. On his ar¬ rival in England, Mr Edwards clofely purfued his fa¬ vourite ftudy of natural hiftory, applying himfelf to drawing and colouring fuch animals as fell under his notice. A ftrift attention to natural, more than pic- tureique beauty, claimed his e.arlieft care : birds firft engaged his particular attention ; and having pur- chaled lome of the beft pictures of thefe fubjedts, he was induced to make a few drawings of bis own j which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalift to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours. Among his firft patrons and bene- faftors may be mentioned James Theobalds, Efq. of Lambeth } a gentleman zealous for the promotion of fcience. Our artift, thus unexpectedly encouraged, in- creafed in Ikill and afliduity j and procured, by his ap¬ plication to his favourite purfuit, a decent fubfiftence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted hisin- duftry in 1731 ; when, in company with two of his re¬ lations, he made an excurfion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected feveral fcarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original pictures of feveral great maftersat Antwerp, Brufiels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the recommenda¬ tion of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart, prefident of the College of Phyficians, he was chofen librarian, and had apartments in the college. This office was peculiarly a- greeable to histafteand inclination, as he had the oppor¬ tunity of a conftant recourfe to a valuable library, fill¬ ed with fcarce and curious books on the fubjeCt of na¬ tural hiftory, which he fo affiduoufiy ftudied. By de¬ grees he became one of the moll eminent ornithologifts in this or any other country. His merit is fo well known in this refpeCt, as t« render any eulogium on his pertormances unneceflary : but it may be obf^rved, that he never trufted to others what he could perform him¬ felf ; and often found it fo difficult to give fatisfaftion to his own mind, that he frequently made three or four drawings to delineate the objeCt in its molt lively cha¬ racter, attitude, and reprefentation.

"Some time after Mr Edwards had been appointed library keeper to the Royal College of Phyficians, he was, on St Andrew’s day, in the year 1750, prefented with an honorary compliment by the prefident and council of the Royal Society, with the gold medal, the donation of Sir Godfrey Copley, Bart, annually given on that day to the author of any new difcovery in art or nature, in confideration of his natural hiftory juft then completed. A copy of this medal he had after¬ wards engraved, and placed under the title in the firft volume of his hiftory. He was a few years afterwards eleCted fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries, London 5 and alio a member of many of the academies of fciences and learning in different parts of Europe. In compliment to thofe honorary diltinCtions from fuch learned bodies, he prefented ele¬ gant coloured copies of all his works to the Royal Col¬ lege ot Phyficians, the Royal Society, and Society of Antiquarians, and to the Britiffi mufeum : alfo to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, from whom he re¬ ceived the moft polite and obliging letter of thanks by their then fecretary Monfieur Defouchy. His collec¬ tion of drawings, which amounted to upwards of 900, were purchafed by the earl of Bute. They contain a great number of Britiffi as well as foreign birds, and other animals hitherto not accurately delineated or de¬ fcribed. After the publication of the laft work, being arrived at his 70th year, he found his fight begin to fail, and his hand loft its wonted fteadinels. He retired from public employment to a little houfe which he purchaf¬ ed at Plaiftow ; previous to which, he difpofed of all the copies, as well as plates of his works. The conver- fation of a few feleft friends, and the perufal of a tew feledt books, were the amufement of the evening of his life j and now and then he made an excurfion to fome of the principal cities in England, particularly to Bri- ftol, Bath, Exeter, and Norwich.

"After an unknown interval of time from this mo¬ narch, reigned Sefoftris. He was the firft great war¬ rior whofe conquefts are recorded with any degree of diftin&nefs. In what age of the world he lived, is uncertain. Some chronologers, among whom is Sir Ifaac Newton, are of opinion, that he is the Sefac or Shifhak, who took Jerufalem in the reign of Re- hoboam the fon of Solomon. Others, however, place him much earlier; and Mr Whifton will have him to be the Pharaoh who refufed to part with the If- raelites, and was at laft drowned in the Red fea. Mr Bryant endeavours to prove that no fuch perfon ever exilted ; but that in his hiftory, as well as that of many ancient heroes, we have an abridgement of that of the Cufhites or Babylonians, who fpread themfelves over great part of the then known world, and everywhere brought the people in fubjeflion to them. His reign is reckoned the raoft extraordinary part of the Egyp¬ tian hiftory ; and the following feems to be the leaft fabulous account that can be got of it. The father of Sefoftris was told in a dream, by the god Vulcan, that his fon, who was then newly born, or perhaps ftill unborn, fhould be lord of the whole earth. His fa¬ ther, upon the credit of this vifion, got together all the males in the land of Egypt that were born on the fame day with Sefofiris; appointed nurfes and pro¬ per perfons to take care of them, and had them treat¬ ed like his own child ; being perluaded that they who had been the conltant companions of his youth would prove the moft faithful minirters and fiddlers. As they grew up, they were inured to laborious exercifes ; and, in particular, were never permitted to tafte any food till they had performed a courfe of 180 furlongs, upwards of 22 of our miles. When the old king ima¬ gined they were fufficiently educated in the martial way he defigned them to follow, they were fent by way of trial of their abilities againft the Arabians.

On receiving this news, Sefoftris haftened from Thrace •, and at the end of nine years came to Pelu- fmm in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the fpoils of Alia. The treacherous bro¬ ther met him at this city ; and it is faid, with very little probability, that Sefoftris accepted of an invita¬ tion to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the reft of the royal family. During the continuance of the enter¬ tainment, Armais caufed a great quantity of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to deep j and as foon as they were retired to reft fet fire to the reeds. Sefoftris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of affifting him, ruffled through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thankf- giving for this wonderful deliverance, he made feveral donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire.

In or¬ der to prevent the incurfions of the Syrians and Ara¬ bians, he fortified the eaft fide of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelufium through the defert to Helio¬ polis, for 1874 miles. He raifed alfo an incredible number of vaft and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed fuch towns as had before been fituated too low, in order to fecure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the fea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile j and not only made an eafier communication between different places, but rendered the country in a great meafure im- paffable to an enemy.

"After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an unfarmountable obftacle to the right, it turned fuddenly to the left j and taking its courfe to the fouthward of Memphis, it fpread its waters through the fands of Libya. The prince we fpeak of caufed a new bed to be dug for it to the eaft of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and difcharge itfelf into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the caftle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was flill to be feen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day acrofs the deferts, pafling to the weft- ward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs ftill beftow upon it the name of Bahr Be/ama, “ or fea without wa¬ ter,” and it is now almoft choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A reflux of the fea was occafioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themfelves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the fands and mud carried along with them were colledled into heaps ; and thus the Delta, at firft very inconfiderable, rofe out of the fea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has fince been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raifing dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to He¬ rodotus, the Delta was in its infancy ; eight cubits of water being then fufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats paffed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial emi¬ nences, refembled the iflands of the Egean fea. At the time that Herodotus vifited this country, 15 cubits ■were neceffary to cover all the Lower Egypt ; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the fpace of two days journey to the right and left of the ifland.

"E G Y [ 61 the precife length of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian cubit •, and even to know the different alterations which that meafure had undergone among thofe people: But this nicety he thinks needlefs, looking upon the general fa£t to be fully eftablidied by what he had faid before. Mr Bruce, however, has treated the fubjedt with much greater accuracy. He obferves, that from the fituation of Canopus, the dillance betwixt Egypt and Cyprus, and the extenfion of the land to the north¬ ward, it appears that no addition of any confequence had been made to it for 3000 years part. The only argument left for the increafe of land therefore muft be taken from the nilometer. The ufe of this inftrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that fo it might be known whether the crop would be fufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exadted of them by the fovereign or not. The firft ftep was to know what fpace of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by menfuration, the next thing was to afcertain the produce of the ground upon an average. Thus becoming acquainted with the greateft and leaft crops produced, together with the exadl extent of ground overflowed, they were furnifh- ed with all the neceflary principles for conftru&ing a nilometer ; and nothing now remained but to eredl a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exadfly into cu¬ bits. This was accordingly done ; the pillar was firft divided into cubits, and thefe again were fubdivided into digits. The firft divifion of this kind was un¬ doubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man ; being the length of the arm from the middle of the round bone in the elbow to the point of the middle finger ; a meafure ftill in ufe among all rude nations. As no ftandard could be found by which this meafure might be exa&ly determined, authors have dif¬ fered very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and of an inch ; the other one foot and of a foot ; but Mr Bruce is of opinion' that both of thefe are too large. He found, by menfuration, the Egyptian cubit to be ex¬ actly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch ; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit ufed for determining the increafe of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increafe was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed ; but that in his time 16 or at leaft 15 cubits were neceffary to produce the fame eff-ft:. But to this account Mr Bruce obje&s, that Herodotus could have no certain information con¬ cerning the nilometer, becaufe he himfelf fays that the priefts, who alone had accefs to it, would tell him no¬ thing of the matter. Herodotus alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation ; and this fuperfluous quantity Mr Bruce fuppofes to have been conveyed in¬ to the defert for the ufe of the Arabs, and that by fuch a vaft drain the rile of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminilhed. But even granting that there was fuch a difference between the rife of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Hero¬ dotus, it does not appear that anv thing like it has appeared ever lince. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 9 ] E G Y 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that Egypt; eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in v the time of Moeris. From fome paffages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exer¬ tion of induftry to caufe this quantity of water pro¬ duce a plentiful crop ; but there is not the leaft reaion to fuppofe, that the very fame induftry was not ne¬ ceffary in the time of Moeris ; fo that ftill there is not any increafe of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian vifited Egypt, we are informed from unqueftionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the ftandard; both which accounts correfpond with that of Herodo¬ tus. Laftly, Procopius, who lived in the time of Jul* tinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requifite for a minimum. # # 13a From thefe accounts, fo various and difcordant, it is No increafe obvious that no certain conclufion can be drawn. ^ is not indeed eafy to determine the reafon of this dif- ^eafon- ference in point of fa£l. 1 he only conje&ure we can ^ fup* offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a fmafter pofed; quantity of water will anfwer the purpofe of producing a plentiful crop, fo it is not unreafonable to fuppofe that at different periods the induftry of the people has varied fo much as to occafion the difagreement in que- ftion.

"E G Y [ 620 ] E G Y Egypt. With regard to his other affertions concerning the city '“""—■v—of Metelis having been once a fea port, M. Volney proves M Sava ^aS Strabo unfairly, and consequently no rv’s opinion ftrefs is to be laid uPon ^em. The principal, indeed concerning the only, evidence which therefore remains, is the palfage the ifle ot already quoted from Homer, viz. that “ the illand of Pharos re- Pharos Js as far ditlant from one of the mouths of the Volney 1 * as a ve^el can one ^ay before the wind.” “ But (fays M. Volney) wThen Homer fpeaks of the diftance of this ifland, he does not mean its diflance from the (bore oppofite, as that traveller (M. Savary) has tranflated him, but from the land of Egypt and the river Nile. In the fecond place, by a day’s fail we mull not underftand that indefinite fpace which the veffels, or rather the boats of the ancient Greeks, could pafs through in a day $ but an accurate and determined meafure of 540 ftadia. This meafure is afcertained by Herodotus, and is the precife diftance between Pharos and the Nile, allowing, with M. d’Anville, 27,000 toifes to 540 Itadia. It is therefore far from being proved, that the increafe of the Delta or of the continent was fo rapid as has been reprefented ; and, if we were difpofed to maintain it, we Humid Hill have to explain how this fhore, which has not gained half a league from the days of Alexander, (hould have gained eleven in the far fhorter period from the time of Menelaus to that conqueror. The utmoft extent of the encroachment of this land upon the fea, however, may be learned from the words of Herodotus ; who informs us, that “ the breadth of Egypt, along the fea coall, from the gulf of Plin- thine to the lake Serbonis near Mount Cafius, is 3600 ftadia ; and its length from the fea to Heliopolis 1500 ftadia.” Allowing therefore the ftadium of Herodotus to be between 50 and 51 French toifes, the 1500 ftadia juft mentioned are equal to 76,000 toifes j which, at the rate of 57,000 to a degree, gives one degree and near 20 minutes and a half. But from the aftronomical obferva- tions of M. Niebuhr, who travelled for the king of Den¬ mark in 1761, the difference of latitude between Helio¬ polis, now called Alatarea, and the fea, being one degree 29 minutes at Damietta, and one degree 24 minutes at Rofetta, there is a difference on one fide of three minutes and a half, or a league and a half encroachment; and eight minutes and a half, or three leagues and a half, on the other.” Thus the difpute concerning the augmentation of the land of Egypt by the Nile feems to be abfolutely decid¬ ed } and the encroachments of it on the fea fo trifling, that we may juftly doubt whether they exift, or whether we are not entirely to attribute the apparent differences to thofe which certainly take place betwixt the ancient and modern menfuration. M. Volney gives a very par¬ ticular defcription of the face of the country $ but takes notice of the inconveniences under which travellers la¬ bour in this country, by which it is rendered extremely difficult to fay any thing certain with regard to the na¬ ture of the foil or mineral produflions. Thefe arife from the barbarity and fuperftition ©f the people, who imagine all the Europeans to be magicians and forcerers, who come by their magic art to difcover the treafures which the genii have concealed under the ruins.

"As the Nile does not always rife to a height fuffi- cient for the purpofes of agriculture, the former fove- reigns of Egypt were at vaft pains to cut proper ca¬ nals in order to fupply the deficiency. Some of thefe are ftill preferved, but great numbers are rendered ufe- lefs through the indolence or barbarity of their fuccef- fors. Thofe which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are bell taken care of by government. The laft is watched by an officer appointed for that purpofe, whofe office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bachria, who receive this fuper- fluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increafe of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by thofe who derive advantage fiom them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the pro¬ vince of Sharkia ; which, making part of the ifthmus of Suez, is the molt confiderable of Egypt, and the moft capable of a great increafe of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are pofieffed by the Arabs, would be no lefs fertile, were it not for the exceffive inclination thefe people have to deftroy, fo that they make war even with the fpontaneous prodtnftions oftheeaith.

The eye-brows are knit, the cheeks rile, the eye lids are contracted, and the mouth diftorted; and this ftate of contraction to which the features of the negroes are perpetually expofed in the hot climates they in¬ habit, is become particularly charaCteriftic.

"“ The folution of this difficulty will alfo folve that of the eledtric explofion, in which there is a collifion, as it were, of the two fluids, while yet they completely pafs one another. For ftill each furface of the glafs may be fuppofed to require its certain portion of eledtric mat¬ ter, and therefore cannot part with one fort without re¬ ceiving an equal quantity of the other.

"In the Shetland ides, the merry dancers, as the nor¬ thern lights are there called, are the conftant atten¬ dants of clear evenings, and afford great relief amid the gloom of the long winter nights. They commonly appear at twilight, near the horizon, of a dim colour, approaching to yellow ; fometimes continuing in that Hate for feveral hours, without any perceptible motion; and afterwards breaking out into ftreams of ftronger light, fpreading into columns, and changing (lowly in¬ to numberlefs different fhapes, and varying in colour from all the tints of yellow, to the moft obfeure ruffet brown. They often cover the whole hemifphere; then exhibiting the mod; brilliant appearance. Their motions at this lime are exceedingly quick, and they aftonifli the fpeclator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were feen before, Ikim briikly along the heavens, are fuddenly extinguiflied, and are fucceeded by a uniform dulky trad!. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the fame manner, and as fuddenly becomes a dark fpace. In fome nights, they affume the appearance of large columns, on one fide of the deepeft yellow, and on the other gradually changing, till it becomes undiflinguifhable from the Iky. They have generally a firong tremulous motion from one end to the other, continuing till the whole vanilhes. As for us, who fee only the extremities of thefe phenomena, we can have but a faint idea of their fplendour and motions. They differ in colour accord¬ ing to the (late of the atmofphere, and fometimes af¬ firming the colour of blood, they make a dreadful ap¬ pearance. The ruftie fages who obferve them become prophetic, and terrify the fpedlators with alarm of war, peftilence, and famine j nor indeed were thefe fuperfii- tious pn fages peculiar to the northern iflands: appear¬ ances of a fimilar nature are of an ancient date •, and they were difHuguiflred by the appellations of phafmata, trabes, and bolides, according to their forms and co¬ lours.

In Hudfon’s bay, it is faid to poffefsa variegated fplendour, equalling that of the full moon. “ In the north-eaft- ern parts of Siberia,” fays Gmelin, “ (befe northern lights are obferved to begin with fingle bright pillars rifing in the north, and almoft at the fame time in the north-eaft, which gradually increafing, comprehend a large fpace of the heavens, rufh about from place to place with incredible velocity, and finally almoft cover the whole Iky up to the zenith, and produce an appear¬ ance as if a vaft tent was fpread in the heavens, glitter¬ ing with gold, rubies, and fapphire.
