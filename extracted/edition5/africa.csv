"CUNOCEPHALI,in Mythology, (from K»»»,“dog,’v and KipxM, “ head,”) a kind of baboons, or animals with heads like thofe of dogs, which were wonder¬ fully endowed, and were preferved with great venera¬ tion by the Egyptians in many of their temples. It is related, that by their aftiftance the Egyptians found out the particular periods of the fun and moon ; and that one half of the animal w7as often buried, while- the other half furvived : and that they could read and write. This ftrange hiftory, Dr Bryant imagines, re¬ lates to the priefts of Egypt, ftyled cahen, to the no¬ vices in their temples, and to the examinations they were obliged to undergo, before they could be ad¬ mitted to the priefthood.

"In the fea, currents are either natural and general, as arifing from the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis 3 or accidental and particular, caufed by the waters being driven againft promontories, or into gulfs and ftraits, where, wanting room to fpread, they are driven back, and thus difturb the ordinary flux of the fea. Currents are various, and directed towards different parts of the ocean, of which fowe Z l 7 ] CUR are conflant, others periodical. The moft extraordi¬ nary current of the fea is that by which part of the Atlantic or African ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the curvature or bay of Africa which they call Fernando Poo ; viz. from weft to eaft* contrary to the general motion : and fuch is the force of the current, that when Ihips approach too near the Ihore, it carries them violently towards that bay, and deceives the mariners in their reckoning. There’ is a great variety of ftiifting currents, which do not laft, but return at certain periods : and thefe do, moft of them, depend upon and follow the anniverfary winds or monfoons, which by blowing in one place may caufe a current in another. Varenius informs us, that at Java, in the ftraits of Sunda, when the monfoons blow from the weft, viz. in the month of May, the currents fet to the call ward, contrary to the general motion. Between the ifland of Celebes and Madura, when the weftern monfoons fet in, viz. in December^ January, and February, or when the winds blow from the north-weft, or between the north and weft, the currents fet to the fouth-eaft, or between the foutli and eafl. At Ceylon, from the middle of March to Odfober, the currents let to the fouthward, and in the other parts of the year to the northward : becaufe at this time the fouthern monfoons blow, and' at the other the northern. Between Cochin-China and Ma¬ lacca, when the weftern msnfoons blow, viz. from April to Auguft, the currents fet eaftward againft the general motion 3 but the reft of the year they fet weft ward, the monfoon confpiring with the general motion. They run fo ftrongly in thefe feas, that un¬ experienced failors miftake them for waves that beat upon the rocks, known uiually by the name of break¬ ers. So for fome months after the 15th of February, the currents fet from the Maldives towards India cm the eaft, againft the general motion of the fea. On the ffiore of China and Cambodia, in the months of Odto- ber, November, and December, the currents fet to the north-weft, and from January to the fouth-weft,. whsn they run with fuch rapidity about the ftioals of Parcel, that they feem fwifter than an arrow.. A t Pulo Ccn- dore, upon the coaft of Cambodia, though the mon¬ foons are fhiftmg, yet the currents fet ftrongly to¬ wards the eaft, even when they blow to a contrary point. Along the coafts of the bay of Bengal, as far as the Cape Romania, at the extreme point of Malacca* the current runs fouthward in November and December. When the monfoons blow from China to Malacca, the fea runs fwiftly from Pulo Cambi to Pulo Condore on the coaft of Cambodia. In the bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope, there is a current particularly remarkable, where the ffa runs from eaft to weft to the landward j and this more vehemently, as it is oppofed by winds from a contrary dire&ion. The caufe is undoubtedly owing to fome adjacent ftiore which is higher than this.

Yet he rvas neverthe- lefs not the more humble on account of his ragged cloak, bag, and tub ; for one day entering Plato’s houfe, at a time when there was a fplendid entertain¬ ment there for feveral perfons of diftinftion, he jump¬ ed upon a very rich couch in all his dirt, faying, Cynics “ I trample on the pride of Plato.” “ Yes, (replied || Plato), but with great pride, Diogenes.” He had the Cynpfce- utmoft contempt for all the human race ; for he walked , the ftreets of Athens at noon-day with a lighted lan- thorn in his hand, telling the people, “ He was in fearch of a man.” Among many excellent maxims of morality, he held fome very pernicious opinions : for he ufed to fay that the uninterrupted good fortune of Harpalus, who generally palled for a thief and a robber, was a * teftimony againft the. gods.

"CYPRIANUS, Thascius Caxilius, a principal father of the Chriftian church, was born at Carthage in Africa, at the latter end of the fecond 01 beginning of the third century. We know nothing more of his parents than that they were Heathens ; and he himfelf continued fuch till the laft 12 years of his life.

Cyprian was alfo a married man himfelf 5 but as foon as he was convert¬ ed to the faith, he refolved upon a ftate of continence, which was thought a high degree of piety, as not be¬ ing yet become general. Being now a Chriftian, he was to give the ufual proof of the fincerity of his eon* verfion $ and that was by writing againft Paganifm and in defence of Chriftianity. With this view he compofed his piece De Gratia Dei, or “ concerning the grace of God,” which he addreffed to Donatus","Carthage, Carthage, Carthage",TN,5,Tunisia,Africa
"It is a work of the fame nature with the Apologetic of Tertullian, and the Oftavius of Minutius Felix. He next compofed a piece De Idolorum Vanitatc, or “ up¬ on the vanity of idols.” Cyprian’s behaviour, both before and after his baptifm, was fo highly pleafing to the biftiop of Carthage, that he ordained him a prieft a few months after. It was rather irregular to ordain a man thus in his very noviciate ; but Cyprian w'as fo extraordinary a perfon, and thought capable of doing fuch Angular fervice to the church, that it ftemed allowable in this cafe to difpenfe a little with the form and difeipline of it. For befides his known talents as a fecular man, he had acquired a high re¬ putation of fandlity fince his converfion ; having not only feparated himfelf from his wife, as we have ob- ferved before, which in thofe days was thought an ex¬ traordinary adt of piety, but alfo configned over all his goods to the poor, and given himfelf up entirely to the things of God. It was on this account no doubt, too, that when the bilhop of Carthage died the year- after, that is, in the year 248, none was judged fo proper to fucceed him as Cyprian. The quiet and re- pofe which the Chriftians had enjoyed during the laft 40 years, had, it feems, greatly corrupted their man¬ ners ; and therefore Cyprian’s firft care, after his ad¬ vancement to the bilhopric, was to corredl diforders and reform abufes.

"32. and N. Lat. 31. The prefent town Hands upon a different fite from the ancient Damietta, fo repeated¬ ly attacked by the European princes. The latter, ac¬ cording to Abulfeda, was “ a town furrounded by walls, and fituated at the mouth of the eaftern branch of the Nile.” Stephen of Byzantium informs us, that it was called Thamiatis under the government of the Greeks of the lower empire, but that it was then very mconfiderable. It increafed in importance every day, in proportion as Pelufium, which was frequently plun¬ dered, loll its power. The total ruin of that ancient town occafioned the commerce of the eaftern parts of the Delta to be transferred to Damietta. It was, how¬ ever, no longer a place of ftrength, when, towards the year 238 of the Hegira, the emperors of Conftantino- ple took poffeffion of it a fecond time. The import¬ ance of a harbour fo favourably fituated opened the eyes of the caliphs. In the year 244 of the Hegira, Elmetouakkel furrounded it with ftrong walls. This obftacle did not prevent Roger king of Sicily from ta¬ king it from the Mahometans in the year 550 of the Hegira. He did not, however, long enjoy his con- queft. Sal ah Eddin, who about that period mounted the throne of Egypt, expelled the Europeans from Da¬ mietta.

The Arabs, however, foon recovered it : but tired of keeping a place which continually drew upon them the moft wai nke nations of Europe, they totally deftroyed it, and rebuilt it further up in the country. This modern Damietta, firft called MencAie, as Abulfeda tells us, has preferved the memory of its origin in a fquare ftill called by that name. Writers in general have con¬ founded thefe two towns, afcribing to the one the at¬ tributes of the other. The modern Damietta is round¬ ed in a femicircle on the eaftern bank of the Nile, two leagues and a half from the mouth of it.

Similar to thefe is the hiftory of Hercules himfelf. But our author ob- ferves, that under the titles of OJiris, Perfeus, Mijrina, &c. the ancients fpoke of the exploits of a whole na¬ tion, who were no other than the Cuthites or Cufh- ites, the defcendants of Culh the fon of Ham and father of Nimrod. Thefe people fpread themfelves into the moft remote corners of the globe ; and hence the heroes whom they reprefented are always fet forth as conquering the whole world.—According to Dio¬ dorus Siculus, the Egyptian Oliris was the fame with the Dionufus of the Greeks. He is faid to have been twice born, and to have had two fathers and two mo¬ thers j to have been wonderfully preferved in an ark j to have travelled all over the earth \ taught the ufe of the vine, to build, plant, &c. The Indians claim him as a native of their country, though fome allow that he came from the weft. Of Cronus and Aftarte, it is faid that they went over the whole earth, dif- pofing of the countries as they pleafed, and doing good wherever they came. The fame is related of Oura- nus, Themis, Apollo, &c. though all their exploits are faid to have been the effects of conqueft, and their benevolence enforced by the fword. In a fi- milar manner he explains the hiftories of other heroes of antiquity ; and having thus, in the characters and hiftory of the moft celebrated perfonages, found traces of the hiftory of Noah and his family, our author proceeds to inquire into the memorials of the deluge itfelf, to be met with in the hiftory or religious rites of the different nations of antiquity. 4 “ We may reafonably fuppofe (fays he), that the par- ticulars of this extraordinary event would be grate-^ fully commemorated by the patriarch himfelf, and be met tranfmitted to every branch of his family j that they with in were made the fubjeft of domeftic converfe, where ^eaJ^en the hiftory was often renewed, and ever attended with avK 0lSj a reverential awe and horror, efpecially in thofe who had been witneffes to the calamity, and had experien¬ ced the hand of Providence in their favour. In pro- cefs of time, when there was a falling off from the truth, we might farther expedt, that a perfon of fo high a character as Noah, fo particularly diftinguilhed by the Deity, could not fail of being reverenced by his pofterity j and when idolatry prevailed, that he would be one of the firft among the fons of men to whom divine honours would be paid. Laftly, we might conclude, that thefe memorials would be inter¬ woven in the mythology of the Gentile world j and that there would be continual allufions to thefe ancient oc¬ currences in the rites and myfteries as they were prac- tifed by the nations of the earth. In conformity to thefe t „ s Varions titles by which Noah was DEL [136 Deluge, thefe fuppofitions, I fhall endeavour to (hew that thefe things did happen ; that the hiftory of the deluge was religioufly preferved in the firfl: ages j that every cir- cumftance of it is to be met with among the hiftorians and mythologies of different countries : and traces of it are to be found, particularly in the facred rites of Egypt and of Greece","Hercules, Providence","US,EG,GR",5,"United States,Egypt,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"
"“ Among the people of the eaft, the true name of the patriarch was preferved ; they called him Noas, Naus, and fometimes contracted Nous ; and many pla¬ ces of fanftity, as well as rivers, were denominated from him. Anaxagoras of Clazomene had obtained fome knowledge of him in Egypt. By him the pa¬ triarch was denominated Noas or Nous ; and both he and his difciples were fenfible that this was a foreign appellation $ notwithftanding which, he has aCted as if it had been a term of the Greek language. Eufebius informs us, that the difciples of Anaxagoras fay, ‘ that Nous is, by interpretation, the deity Dis or Dios; and they likewife efteem Nous the fame as Prome¬ theus, becaufe he was the renewer of mankind, and was faid to have faftiioned them again,1 after they had been in a manner extinCt. After this, however, he gives a folution of the ftory, upon the fuppofition that Nous is the fame with the Greek word vs#?, the mind : that ‘ the mind was Prometheia; and Prome¬ theus was faid to renew mankind, from new forming their minds, and leading them, by cultivation, from ignorance.1 “ Suidas has preferved, from fome ancient author, a curious memorial of this wonderful perfonage, whom he affe&s to diftinguifh from Deucalion, and ftyles Nannacus. According to him, this Nannacus was a perfon of great antiquity, and prior to the time of Deucalion. He is faid to have been a king, who forefeeing the approaching deluge, collefted every body together, and led them to a temple, where he offered up his prayers for them, accompanied with ] BEL many tears. There is likewife a proverbial expref- fion about Nannacus applied to people of great anti- 6 quity. ' 'J “ Stephanus gives great light to this hiftory, and fup- plies many deficiencies. “ The tradition is (fays he), that there was one formerly named Annaeus, the extent of whofe life was above 300 years. The people who were of his neighbourhood and acquaintance had inquired of an oracle how long he was to live j and there was an anfwer given, that when Annaeus died, all mankind would be deftroyed. The Phrygians, upon this ac¬ count, made great lamentations, from whence arofe the proverb re S7r< Airvax-y the lamentation of Annaeus, made ufe of for people in circumftances highly calamitous. When the flood of Deucalion came, all mankind were deftroyed, according as the oracle had foretold. Afterwards, when the furface of the earth began to be again dry, Zeus ordered Prome¬ theus and Minerva to make images of clay in the form of men ; and, when they were finiftred, he called the winds, and made them breathe into each, and render them vital.” From thefe hiftories Mr Bryant concludes as fol¬ lows : ^ However the ftory may have been varied, the principal outlines plainly point out the perfon who is alluded to in thefe hiftories. It is, I think, mani- feft, that Annaeus, and Nannacus, and even Inachus, relate to Noachus or Noah. And not only thefe, Inacl^s but the hiftories of Deucalion and Prometheus have Deucalion, a like reference to the patriarch 5 in the 600th year, and Prome- and not the 300th, of whofe life the waters pre. theus»the vailed upon the earth. He was the father of man-^mehWltk kind, who were renewed in him.

"HoAvever groundlefs the notions may be of the Avaters having retreated through thefe paffages, yet they ftiow Avhat impreflions of this event Avere retained by the Ammonians, who introduced fome hiftory of it where- ever they came. As different nations fucceeded one another in thefe parts, and time produced a mixture of generations, they varied the hiftory, and modelled it according to their notions and traditions ; yet the ground-work was always true, and the event for a long time univerfally commemorated. Jofcphus, Avho feims to have been a perfon of extenfive knowledge, and verfed in the hiftories of nations, fays, that this great occurrence was to be met Avith in the writings of all perfons Avho treated of the firft ages.

"It was a temple facred to Ofiris at Theba:- or, to fay the truth, it was itfelf called Theba; and both the city, faid to be one of the moft ancient in Egypt, as well as the province, were undoubtedly denominated from it. Now Theba was the name of the ark. It is the very word made ufe of by the facred writer ; fo that we may, I think, be affured of the prototype after which this temple was faihioned. It is faid in¬ deed to have been only 280 cubits in length j whereas the ark of Noah was 300. But this is a variation of only one-fifteenth in the whole : and as the ancient cubit was not in all countries the fame, we may fup- pofe that this difparity arofe rather from the manner of meafuring, than from any real difference in the. extent of the building. It was an idolatrous temple, faid to have been built by Sefoftris in honour of Ofiris. I have been repeatedly obliged to take notice of the ig¬ norance of the Greeks in refpeft to ancient titles, and have ftiown their mifapplication of terms in many inftances j efpecially in their fuppofing temples to have been ere&ed by perfons to whom they were in reality facred. Sefoflris was Ofiris ; the fame as Dionufus, Menes, and Noah. He is called Seifithrus by Abyde- nus j Xixouthros by Berofus and Apollodorus j and is reprefented by them as a prince in whofe time the de¬ luge happened. He was called Zuth, Xuth, and Zeus ; and had certainly divine honours paid to him",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"“ Paufanias gives a remarkable account of a temple of Hercules at Evulhra in Ionia j which he mentions as of the highelt antiquity, and very like thofe of Egypt.

Ariftides mentions, that at Smyrna, upon the feaft called Dionysta, a (hip ufed to be carried in proceflion. The fame cuftom prevailed among the Athenians at the Panathensea ; when what was termed the facred fliip was borne with great reverence through the city to the temple of Dameter at Eleufis. At Phalerus, near Athens, there were honours paid to an unknown hero, who was reprefented in the ftern of a fliip. At Olympia, the moft facred place in Greece, was a reprefentation of the like nature. It was a building like the fore-part of a fliip, which flood facing the end of the hippodromus $ and towards the middle of it was an altar, upon which, at the renewal of each olympiad, certain rites were performed","Hercules, Smyrna, Athens","US,EG,GR",5,"United States,Egypt,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"
"“ I think it is pretty plain that all thefe emblemati¬ cal reprefentations, of which I have given fo many in¬ ftances, related to the hiftory of the deluge, and the confervation of one family in the ark. I his hiftory was pretty recent when thefe works were executed in Egypt, and when the rites were firft eftabliftied : and there is reafon to think, that in early times moft fhrines of the Mizraim were formed under the refem- blance of a ftiip, in memory of this great event. Nay, farther, both fliips and temples received their names from thence, being ftyled by the Greeks, who bor¬ rowed largely from Egypt, Nxvs, and Naaj, and mari¬ ners Nutvrx, Nautce, in reference to the patriarch, who was varioully ftyled Noas, Nous, and Noah",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"a machine of this fabric. Adonis was hid in an ark by Venus, and was fuppofed to have been in a ftate of death for a year. Theocritus introduces a paftoral perfonage named Comates, who was expofed in an ark for the fame term, and wonderfully preferved. Of Ofiris being expofed in an ark we have a very remark¬ able account in Plutarch ; who mentions, that it was on account of Typhon, and that it happened on the 17th of the month Athyr, when the fun was in Scor¬ pio. This, in my judgment, was the precife time when Noah entered the ark, and when the flood came, which, in the Egyptian mythology, was called 7y- phon. 13 “ Typhon is one of thofe whofe charaifter has been^xplana- greatly confounded. This has arifen from two differ- ent perfonages being included under one name, ^ undoubtedly were diftinguifhed in the language of E- gypt. Typhon was a compound of Tuph or Tvpha- On; and fignified a high altar of the Deity. There were feveral fuch in Egypt, upon which they offered human facrifices ; and the cities which had thefe al¬ tars were ftyled Typhonian. But there was another Typhon, who was very different from the former, how¬ ever by miflake blended with that charaifter. By this was fignified a mighty whirlwind and inundation ; and it oftentimes denoted the ocean *, and particularly the ocean in a ferment. For, as Plutarch obferves, by Typhon was underftood any thing violent and unruly",Of,"EG,TR",5,"Egypt,Turkey","Africa,Asia"
"Through this the patriarch made his defcent; and at this point was the commencement of time. This hi- flory is obfcurely alluded to in the account of Typhon; of whom it is faid, that without any regard to time or place, he forced a paffage and burft into light ob¬ liquely through the fide of his mother. This return to light was defcribed as a revival from the grave ; and Plutarch accordingly mentions the return of Ofiris from Hades, after he had been for a long feafon in¬ clofed in an ark and in a ftate of death. This re¬ newal of life was by the Egyptians efteemed a fecond Hate of childhood. They accordingly, in their hiero¬ glyphics, defcribed him as a boy, whom they placed upon the lotus or water-lily, and called him Orus. He was the fuppofed fon of Ifis; but it has been fhown that Ifis, Rhea, Atargatis, were all emblems of the ark, that receptacle which was ftyled the mother of mankind. Orus is reprefented as undergoing from the Titans all that Ofiris fuffered from Typhon ; and the hiftory at bottom is the fame. Hence it is faid of Ifis, that {he had the power of making people im¬ mortal ; and that when {he found her fon Orus, in the midft of the waters, dead through the malice of the Titans, flie not only gave him a renewal of life, but alfo conferred upon him immortality.” In this manner does our author decipher almoft all the ancient fables, of which no fatisfa&ory folution was ever given before. He {hows that the primitive gods of Egypt, who were in number eight, were no other than the eight perfons faved in the ark; that almoft all the heathen deities had one way or other a reference to Noah. He {hows that he was chara&erifed under the titles of Janus, Nereus, Proteus, Oannes, Dagon, &c",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"I he Indians have a perfon whom they call Buto or Budo. T his is the fame as Boutus of Egypt, Battus of Gyrene, and Boeotus of Greece : the account gi¬ ven of him is fimilar to that of Typhon; for it is faid that he did not come to life in the ufual way, but made himfelf a paffage through the fide of his mother ; which mother is reprefented as a virgin. This hiftory, though now current among the Indians, is of great antiquity, as we may learn from the account given of this perfonage by Clemens Alexandrinus. “ There is a caft of Indians (fays he) who are difciples of Bou- tas. This perfon, on account of his extraordinary fan&ity, they look up to as a god.” The name of Boutas, Battus, and Boeotus, though apparently con¬ ferred upon the patriarch, yet originally related to the machine in which he was preferved. Of this fome traces may be found among the Greeks. One of the Ammonian names for the ark was Aren, or Arene • and Boeotus is faid by Diodorus Siculus to have been the fon of Neptune and Arne, which is a contraflion of arene the ark.

"One of thefe was called Kiakiack, or the God of Goas temple. The other is called the temple of Dagun ; and the doors and windows of it are perpetually {hut, fo that none can enter but the priefts. They will not tell of what ftiape the idol is, but only fay that it is not of human form. The former deity, Kiakiack, is repre- fented as afleep, of a human (hape, and 60 feet long ; and when he awakes, the world is to be deftroyed. As jfoon as Kiakiack has diffblved the frame and being of 4 i ] DEL this world, Dagun will gather up the fragments, and Delude, make a new one. I make no doubt but the true name <—■ y—— of the temple was lach-Iach, and dedicated to the fame god as the Jachufi in Japan. Mr Wife takes no¬ tice of the Grecian exclamation to Dionufus, when the terms lacche, 0 lacche, were repeated : and he fuppofes, with great probability, that the Peguan name had a reference to the fame deity. It is certain, that the worfhip of Dionufus prevailed very early among the nations in the eaft. The Indians ufed to maintain, that his rites firft began among them. Profeffor Bayer has drown, that traces of his worlhip are ftill to be ob- ferved among the Tamuli of Tranquebar. “ They have a tradition- (fays he), that there was once a gigan¬ tic perfon named Maidajhuren, who was born of Nifa- dabura near the mountain Meru.

"Marcellinus takes notice of a ftatue of Apollo named Cornells j which, in the time of the emperor Verus, was brought from Seleucia to Rome. This related to the fame deity as the preceding.

It is remarkable, that in Japan the pnefts and no¬ bility have the title of Garni. The emperor Quebacon- dono, in a letter to the Portuguefe viceroy, 1585, tells him that Japan is the kingdom of Chamis ; whom, fays he, we hold to be the fame as Scin, the origin of all things.

"“ This god was fuppofed (fays Mr Bryant) to have neither father nor mother. By Budha we are certain¬ ly to underftand the idolatrous fymbol called by fome nations Ruddo j the fame as ybngus and Eheba (names for the ark). In the mythology concerning it, we may fee a reference both to the machine itfelf and to the perfon preferved in it. In confequence of which we find this perfon alfo ftyled Bod, Budha, and Bud- do ; and in the weft Batus, Battus, and Bceotus. He was faid by the Indians not to have been born in the ordinary way, but to have come to light indire&ly through the fide of his mother. By Clemens of Alexandria he is called Bouta; and in the hiftory of this perfon, however varied, we may perceive a re¬ lation to the arkite deity of the fea, called Pofeidon or Neptune ; alfo to Arculus and Dionufus, ftyled Baotus and Thebanus. Kaempfer has a curious hiftory of a deity of this fort called Bhutto; whofe temple flood in the province of Bungo, upon the fea-fhore, near the village of loma. About a quarter of a German mile before you come to this village, flands a famous temple of the god Abutto ; which is faid to be very eminent for miraculoufly curing many invete¬ rate diftempers, as alfo for procuring a wind and good paffage. for this reafon, failors and palfengers al¬ ways tie fome farthings to a piece of wood, and throw it into the fea, as an offering to this Abutto, to obtain a favourable wind.

And though the ftory is told with fome variation, yet in all the circumftances of confequence it accords very happily with the mythology of Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It matters not how the emblems have by length of time been mifinterpreted. We have the mundane egg upon the waters, and the concomi¬ tant fymbol of the moon ; and the egg at la A opened by the afliftance of the facred fleer, upon which, the world iflues forth to this day.” The author proceeds afterwards to mention the great veneration paid in thefe parts to the ox and cow j and fays, that nobody dares injure them. One deity of the Japanefe was Canon, the reputed lord of the ocean. He was repre¬ fented in an ere<fl pofture, crowned w'ith a flower, and coming out of the mouth of a fifli. He is reprefented in the fame manner by the natives of India, and named Vijhnou and Macauter ; and he is to be found in other parts of the eaft.

"Among many other furprifing things, that author fays, concerning the Hyperborean itland, “ That its inhabi¬ tants believed that Apollo defeended into their illand at the end of every 19 years ; in which period of time the fun and moon, having performed their various revolu¬ tions, return to the fame point, and begin to repeat the fame revolutions. This is called by the Greeks the great year, or the cycle of Meton.” Their We are told both by Csefar and Mela, that the knowledge druids ftudied the liars as well as the fun and moon j of the ftars.ancl that they profeffed to know, and taught their difciples, many things concerning the motions of thefe heavenly bodies. From thefe teftimonies we may con¬ clude that the druids were acquainted with the pla¬ nets, diftinguifhed them from the fixed liars, and care¬ fully obferved their motions and revolutions. If this difeovery was the refult of their own obfervations, it would be gradual, and it would be a long time before they found out all the planets. They might perhaps have received fome aflillance and information from Py¬ thagoras, or from fome other quarter. But whether this difeovery of the planets was their own, or com¬ municated to them by others, it is highly probable that they were acquainted with the precife number of thefe wandering liars. Dio Cafiius fays, that the cullom of giving the name of one of the planets to each of the leven days of the week was an invention of the Egyp¬ tians, and from them was gradually communicated to all the other nations of the world ; and that in his time this cultom was fo firmly eltablilhed, not only among the Romans, but among all the reft of man¬ kind, that in every country it appeared to be a native inftitution. The knowledge of the planets, and per¬ haps the cuftom of giving their names to the days of the week, was brought out of Egypt into Italy by Pythagoras, more than 500 years before the beginning of the Chriftiaii era *, and from thence it could not be very long before it reached Gaul and Britain. Butv~-v-« though we have little or no reafon to doubt that the druids knew the number and obferved the motion of the planets, yet it may be queftioned whether they had difeovered the times in which they performed their fe- veral revolutions. Some of thefe liars, as Jupiter and Saturn, take fo great a number of years in revolving, that it required a very extraordinary degree of patience and attention to difeover the precife periods of their revolutions. If we could be certain that the ifland in which the ancients imagined Saturn lay afleep, was one of the Britilh ifles, as Plutarch intimates it was, we might be inclined to think that the Britilh druids were not ignorant of the length of the period in which the planet Saturn performs a revolution. For that fame au¬ thor, in another treatife, tells us, “ That the inhabi¬ tants of that illand kept every thirtieth year a folemn feftival in honour of Saturn, when his ftar entered into the fign oi Taurus.” If we could depend upon the above teftimony of Plutarch, we Ihould have one pofitive proof that the druids of the Britith ifles w’ere acquainted with the conftellations, and even with the ligns of the zodiac ; and that they meafured the revolutions of the fun and planets, by obfervmg the length of time betweeti their departure from and return to one of thefe figns* But we have no dirett evidence of this remaining in hiftory",Jupiter,"EG,IT,US",5,"Egypt,Italy,United States","Africa,Europe,North America"
"Though the druids were unacquainted with the Ara¬ bic cbaraflers, which are now in ule, we have no rea- fon to fuppofe that they were delfitute of marks or characters of fome other kind, which, in fome mea- fure, anfwered the fame purpofes, both in making and recording their calculations. In particular, we have reafon to think, that they made ufe of the letters of the Greek alphabet for both thefe purpofes. This feems to be plainly intimated by Crefar in the follow¬ ing expreffion concerning the druids of Gaul: “ In almolt all other public tranfaflions and private ac¬ counts or computations, they mske ule of the Greek letters.” This is further confirmed by w bst the fame Author fays of the Helvetii ; a people of the fame ori¬ gin, language, and manners, with the Gauls and Bri¬ tons. “ Tables were found in the camp of the Hel¬ vetii written in Greek letters, containing an account of all the men capable of bearing arras, who bad left their native country, and alfo feparate accounts of the boys, old men, and women.” There i-s hiftorical evidence of the druids being alfo well acquainted with geome¬ try. “ When any difputes arife (fays Ccefiir) about their inheritances, or any controverfies about the -li¬ mits of their fields, they are entirely referred to the dec.ifion of their druids.” But befides the knowledge of uienfuration which this implies, both Cuefar and Mela plainly intimate that the druids were converiant in the mofi fublime (peculations of geometry 5 “ in meafuring the magnitude of the earth, and even of the 9 world.” 11 in me- There are ftill many monuments remaining in uues.

"But thefe pretenfions of the druids to magic and divination, which contributed fo much to the advance¬ ment of their fame and fortune in their own times, have brought very heavy reproaches upon their memo¬ ry, and have made feme learned moderns declare that they ought to be expunged out of the catalogue of philofophers, and efleemed no better than mere cheats and jugglers. This cenfure is evidently too fevere, and might have been pronounced with equal juftice upon all- the ancient philofuphers of Egypt, Afiyria, Perfia, Greece, and Rome 5 who were great pretend¬ ers to magic and divination, as well as our druids. “ I know of no nation in the world (fays Cicero) either fo polite and learned, or fo favage and barbarous, as not to believe that future events are prefignified to us,, and may by fome men be difeovered and foretold.” The only conclufion therefore that can be fairly drawn, from the fuccefsful pretenfions of the Britifli druids to the arts of magic and divination, is this—-That they bad more knowledge than their countrymen and contem¬ poraries ; but had not fo much virtue as to refill the temp¬ tation of impofing upon their ignorance to their own ad¬ vantage","Rome, Cicero","US,EG,GR",5,"United States,Egypt,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"

At this period, too, the civil power loft its authority j and religion, which from that derives the means of preferving its unity, {hared the fame fate, and the Mahometans now experienced what had before befallen the Chriftians.

He was one of the mod extraordinary princes of whom hidory has preferved the memory. He taufed the fird caliphs, the companions of Mahomet, t6 be curfed in the mofques, and afterwards revoked the anathema : He compelled the Jews and Chndians to abjure their religion, and then permitted them to refume It. He prohibited the making dippers for women, to prevent them from coming out of their homes. He burnt one half of the city of Cairo for his diverfion, -while his foldiers plundered the other.

The Clyde waflies it on the fouth, and the Leven on the Aveft, both of which contain ex¬ cellent trout and falmon. The caftle of Dunbarton lies at a fmall diftance from the toAvn, on the point of land formed by the jun&ion of the Clyde and Leven; it is fituated on the top of a rock, which prefents a pi&urefque objedt: the rock divides about the middle, and forms two fummits : the fides are craggy, and the buildings upon it, though not of themfelves beautiful, have a good effeft, and, as Mr Gilpin obferves, “ ferve to give it an air of confequence.” The fortrefs is en¬ tered by a gate at the bottom ; and within the rampart, which defends the entrance, is the guard-houfe, and lodgings for the officers ; from hence the afcent is by a long flight of ftone fteps to the part where the rock divides : here is a ftrong battery, barracks for the gar- rifon, and a refervoir always filled with water ; above thefe, on the loAver fummit, are feveral batteries, Avhich command a moft extenfive range.

"Dundee, befide St Andrew’s church, has four o- ther churches, and five miniders on the legal edablifh- ment. The old church, in which were originally four places of worfhip, when entire, had been a very mag¬ nificent building, with a large fquare Gothic tower or fteeple 186 feethigh,on the wed end of the church. This building was in the form of a crofs, ererded by David carl of Huntingdon, brother to William I. of Scot¬ land (furnamed the Lion), and was dedicated to the virgin Mary. This he did on his return from the third crufade (in which with 500 of his countrymen he had accompanied Richard I. of England) anno 1189, in gra¬ titude for his deliverance from feveral imminent dan¬ gers, and particularly from drip wreck, by which he had nearly perifhed when in fight of this town. At the fame time he changed the name of the town from Al- le&um toDeiDonum, whence its prefent name is thought by many to be derived ; while others maintain that its name was Duntay, or “ the hill of Tay.” The word AlleElum in the Gaelic fignifies “ beautiful,” and har¬ monizes very well with the Scripture fenfe of the hill of God. The word Duntay has the very fame fignifi- cation, “ the Hill of God 5” and both agree with the delightful fituation of Dundee, and unite in giving it with propriety the name of Bonny Dundee. The hill rifes on the north of the town to a great height, and is called The Law of Dundee i /am being a Saxon word for a round hill fuch as it is.

"gin of By the overthrow of James IV. at the battle of town Flowden, the city of Edinburgh was overwhelmed ln*' with grief and confufion, that monarch having been attended in his unfortunate expedition by the earl of Angus, then provoft, with the reft of the magiftrates, and a number of the principal inhabitants, moft of whom perifhed in the battle. After this difafter, the inhabitants being alarmed for the fafety of their city, it was enabled that every fourth man ftiould keep watch at night ; the fortifications of the town were renewed, the wall being alfo extended in fuch a man¬ ner as to enclofe the Grafsmarket, and the field on which Heriot’s Hofpital, the Grey Friars Church, and Charity Workhoufe, Hand. On the eaft fide it was made to enclofe the College, Infirmary, and High School ; after which, turning to the north, it met the old wall at the Netherbow port. After this alarm was over, the inhabitants were gradually relieved from the trouble of watching at night, and a certain number of militia appointed to prevent difturbances ; who con¬ tinue to this day, and are known by the name of the Town Guard. Before thefe new enclofures, moft of the principal people lived in the Cowgate without the wall; and the burying place was fituated where the EDI Parliament Clofe now is. In our days of peace, when Edinburgh, no alarm of an enemy is at all probable, great part of ——y— the walls, with all the gates, have been taken down, and the city laid quite open, in order to afford more ready paffage to the great concourfe of people with whom the ftreet is daily filled. But at the period we fpeak of, not only were the inhabitants much lefs numerous by reafon of the fmall extent of the city, but it was depopulated by a dreadful plague j fo that, to flop if poffible the progrefs of the infedfion, all houfes and (hops were (hut up for 14 days, and fome where infedled perfons had died were pulled down al¬ together. s In 1504, the traft of ground called the Bwrror/^^Eredtion of Muir was totally overgrown with wood, though now wooden it affords not the fmalleft veftige of having been in^011!6** fuch a ftate. So great was the quantity at that time, however, that it was enadted by the town council, that whoever inclined to purchafe as much wood as was fufficient to make a new front for their koufe, might extend it feven feet into the ftreet. Thus the city was in a (hort time filled with houfes of wood inftead of ftone j by which, befides the inconvenience of ha¬ ving the ftreet narrowed 14 feet, and the beauty of the whole entirely marred, it became much more lia¬ ble to accidents by fire : but almoft all thefe are now pulled down 5 and in doing this a fingular tafte in the mafonry which fupported them is faid to have been dif- covered. 9 In 1542, a war with England having commenced Edinburgh through the treachery of Cardinal Beaton, an Engliffi cleHroyecI fleet of 200 fail entered the Forth j and having landed ^7 their forces, quickly made themfelves mailers of the 'a towns of Leith and Edinburgh.

On the death of his parents,., he gave all his eflate to the poor ; and travelled into France, where he retired into a wildernefs near the conflux of the Rhone with the fea, and continued there three years. Having obtained the reputation of ex¬ traordinary fanftity, various miracles were attributed to him ; and he founded a monaHery in Languedoc, known long after by the name of St Giles's.—In the reign of James II. Mr Preflon of Gorton, a gentleman whofe defeendants Hill poffefs an eHate in the county of Edinburgh, got pofTeflion of the arm of this faint; which relick he bequeathed to the church of Edin¬ burgh.

The affair is thus related by Manetho. It happened, in the reign of Timaus king of Egypt, that God being difpleafed with the Egyptians, they fuffered a great revolution : for a multitude of men, ignoble in their race, took courage, and, pouring from the eaft into Egypt, made war with the inhabitants •, who fubmitted to them with¬ out refiftance. The fhepherds, however, behaved with the greateft cruelty j burnt the cities, threw down the temples of the gods } and put to death the inhabitants, carrying the women and children into captivity. This people came from Arabia, and were called Hycfos, or king-fhepherds. They held Egypt in fubjeftion for 259 years; at the end of which period, they were obliged by a king of Upper Egypt, named Amofis, or Theth- imfis, to leave the country. This prince’s father had, it feems, gained great advantages over them, and fhut them up in a place called Aborts, or Avaris, contain¬ ing 10,000 acres of land. Here they were clofely be- fieged by Amofis, with an army of 400,000 men ; but at laft the king, finding himfelf unable to reduce them by force, propofed an agreement, which was readily accepted. In confequence of this agreement, the fliep- herds withdrew from Egypt with their families, to the number of 240,000 ; and, taking the way of the de- fert,entered Syria: but fearing the Affyrians, who were then very powerful, and matters of Afia, they enter¬ ed the land of Judaea ; and built there a city capable of holding fo great a multitude, and called it Jeru- falem",,"EG,SY",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic","Africa,Asia"

"They were, he fays, carriers to the Cufhites who lived farther to the fouth. The latter had built the many flately temples in Thebes and other cities of Egypt ; though, according to him, they had no dwelling places but holes or caves in the rocks. Being a commercial people, they remained at home collefling and prepa¬ ring their articles, which were difperfed by thu Bara- bers or fhepherds already mentioned. Thefe, from the nature of their employment, lived in moveable habi¬ tations, as the Tartars do at this day. By the He¬ brews, he tells us, they were called phut, h\s\- fiepherds by every other people ; and from the name bomber, the word Barabra 'is derived. By their employment, which was the difperfing the Arabian and African goods all over the continent, they had become a gr^at and powerful people ; and from their oppofite difpofitions and manners, became verv frequently enemies to the Egyptians. To one Salatis our author afcribes the deflruflion of Thebes in Upper Egypt, fo much cele¬ brated by Homer for its magnificence. But this cer¬ tainly cannot be the cafe ; for H >mer wrote long af¬ ter the time of Jofeph : and we find that even then the Egyptians had the (hepherds in abhorrence, in all probability becaufe thev had been grievoufiv oppreflfed by them. Mr B^uce counts three invafions of thefe people ; the firfl that of Salatis already mentioned, who overthrew the firft dynafly of Egyptian kings from Me- nes, and deftroyed Thebes : the fecond was that of Sabacco or So; for according to him this was not the name of a Angle prince, but of a people, and ligni- fies Jhepherdsi and the third, after the building of Mem- Egypt, phis, where 240,000 of them were befieged as above —v— mentioned. But accounts of this kind *f« evidently inconliftent in the higheft degree, ; for how is it pof- fible that the third invalion, antecedent to the building of Jerufalem, could be port trior to the fecund, if the latter happened only in the days of Heztkiah ?

"After an unknown interval of time from this mo¬ narch, reigned Sefoftris. He was the firft great war¬ rior whofe conquefts are recorded with any degree of diftin&nefs. In what age of the world he lived, is uncertain. Some chronologers, among whom is Sir Ifaac Newton, are of opinion, that he is the Sefac or Shifhak, who took Jerufalem in the reign of Re- hoboam the fon of Solomon. Others, however, place him much earlier; and Mr Whifton will have him to be the Pharaoh who refufed to part with the If- raelites, and was at laft drowned in the Red fea. Mr Bryant endeavours to prove that no fuch perfon ever exilted ; but that in his hiftory, as well as that of many ancient heroes, we have an abridgement of that of the Cufhites or Babylonians, who fpread themfelves over great part of the then known world, and everywhere brought the people in fubjeflion to them. His reign is reckoned the raoft extraordinary part of the Egyp¬ tian hiftory ; and the following feems to be the leaft fabulous account that can be got of it. The father of Sefoftris was told in a dream, by the god Vulcan, that his fon, who was then newly born, or perhaps ftill unborn, fhould be lord of the whole earth. His fa¬ ther, upon the credit of this vifion, got together all the males in the land of Egypt that were born on the fame day with Sefofiris; appointed nurfes and pro¬ per perfons to take care of them, and had them treat¬ ed like his own child ; being perluaded that they who had been the conltant companions of his youth would prove the moft faithful minirters and fiddlers. As they grew up, they were inured to laborious exercifes ; and, in particular, were never permitted to tafte any food till they had performed a courfe of 180 furlongs, upwards of 22 of our miles. When the old king ima¬ gined they were fufficiently educated in the martial way he defigned them to follow, they were fent by way of trial of their abilities againft the Arabians. In this expedition Sefoftris proved fuccefsful, and in the end fubdued that people who had never before been con¬ quered. He was fent to the we ft ward, and conquered the greateft part of Africa ; nor could he be flopped in his career till lie arrived at the Atlantic ocean","Bryant, Vulcan","EG,US,RO",5,"Egypt,United States,Romania","Africa,North America,Europe"
"Whilft he was on this expedition, his father died j and then Sefoftris refolved to fulfil the prediifJion of Vulcan, by a&ually conquering the whole world. As he knew that this muft take- up a long time, he pre¬ pared for his journey in the beft manner portable. The kingdom he divided into 56 provinces, and endeavour¬ ed to fecure the affeflions of the people by gifts both of money and land. He forgave all who had been guilty c offences, and difeharged the debts of all his foldiers. He then conftituted his brother Armak th® j E G Y [ 592 j E G Y Egypt, the fupreme regent; but forbade him to ufe the diadem, y—aiicj commanded him to offer no injury to the queen or her children, and to abflain from the royal concubines",Vulcan,"EG,RO",5,"Egypt,Romania","Africa,Europe"
"He crofled the Ganges, and eredled pillars on its banks ; and from thence he is faid to have marched eaft ward to the very extremity of the Afiatic conti¬ nent. Returning from thence, he invaded the Scy¬ thians and Thracians \ but all authors do not agree that he conquered them. Some even affirm, that he was overthrown by them with great flaughter, and ob¬ liged to abandon a great part of his booty and mili¬ tary ftores. But whether he had good or bad fuc- cefs in thefe parts, it is a common opinion that he fettled a colony in Colchis. Herodotus, however, who gives the moft particular account of the conquefts of this monarch, does not fay whether the colony was de- fignedly planted by Sefoftris : or whether part of his army loitered behind the reft, and took up their refi- dence in that region. From his own knowledge, he af- ferts, that the inhabitants of that country were undoubt¬ edly of Egyptian defcent. This was evident from the perfonal refemblance they bore to the Egyptians, who were fvvarthy complexioned and frizzle haired; but more efpecially from the conformity of their cuftoms, par¬ ticularly circumcifion. ' The utmoft boundary of this mighty monarch’s con¬ quefts, however, was in the country of Thrace ; for beyond this country his pillars were nowhere to be feen. Thefe pillars he was accuftomed to fet up in every country which he conquered, with the following 1 infcription, or one to the fame purpofe : “ Sefoftris, kings of kings, and lords of lords, fubdued this country by the power of his arms ” Befides thefe, he left alfo ilatues of himfelf; two of which, according to Hero¬ dotus, were to be feen in his time j the one on the road between Ephefus and Phocaea, and the other be¬ tween Smyrna and Sardis : they were armed after the Ethiopian and Egyptian manner j holding a javelin in one hand and a bow in the other.

"the world unfiniftied, were the want of provifions for his army, and the difficulty of the pafles. Moft pro¬ bably, however, his return was haftened by the intelli¬ gence he received from the high pried of Egypt, con¬ cerning the rebellious proceedings of his brother j who, encouraged by his long abfence, bad alfumed the dia¬ dem, violated the queen, and alfo the royal concu¬ bines. On receiving this news, Sefoftris haftened from Thrace •, and at the end of nine years came to Pelu- fmm in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the fpoils of Alia. The treacherous bro¬ ther met him at this city ; and it is faid, with very little probability, that Sefoftris accepted of an invita¬ tion to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the reft of the royal family. During the continuance of the enter¬ tainment, Armais caufed a great quantity of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to deep j and as foon as they were retired to reft fet fire to the reeds. Sefoftris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of affifting him, ruffled through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thankf- giving for this wonderful deliverance, he made feveral donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire. He then took vengeance on his brother Armais, faid to be the Danaus of the Greeks, who, being on this occafion driven out of Egypt, withdrew into Greece. ^ Sefoftris now laid afide all thoughts of war, and ap-jiisgre; plied himfelf wholly to fuch works as might tend to works, the public good, and his own future reputation. In or¬ der to prevent the incurfions of the Syrians and Ara¬ bians, he fortified the eaft fide of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelufium through the defert to Helio¬ polis, for 1874 miles. He raifed alfo an incredible number of vaft and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed fuch towns as had before been fituated too low, in order to fecure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the fea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile j and not only made an eafier communication between different places, but rendered the country in a great meafure im- paffable to an enemy. He eredled a temple in every city in Egypt, and dedicated it to the fupreme deity of the place j but in the courfe of fuch a great under¬ taking as this neceffarily muft have been, he took care not to employ any of his Egyptian fubjefts. 'Ihus he fecured their aftedlion, and employed the vaft multi¬ tude of captives he had brought along with him ; and to perpetuate the memory of a tranfaflion fo remark¬ able, he caufed to be infcribed on all thefe temples, “ No one native laboured hereon.” In the city of Memphis, before the temple of Vulcan, he raifed fix gigantic ftatues, each of one (lone.

The Babylonians particularly were concerned in this revolt, and laid wafte the coun¬ try to fome extent $ but being offered a pardon and a place to dwell in, they were pacified, and built for therm felves a city, which they called Babylon. Towards the conquered princes who waited on him with their tri¬ bute the Egyptian monarch behaved with unparalleled infolence. On certain occafions he is faid to have un- harnafled his horfes, and, yoking kings together, made them draw his chariot. One day, however, obferving one of the kings who drew his chariot to look back upon the wheels with great earneftnefs, he alked what made him look fo attentively at them ? ,The unhappy prince replied, “ O king, the going round of the wheel puts me in mind of the viciffitudes of fortune : for as every part of the wheel is uppermoft and lowermolt by turns, fo it is with men j who one day fit upon a throne, and on the next are reduced to the vileft degree of flavery.” This anfwer brought the infulting conqueror to his fenfes j fo that he gave over the practice, and thenceforth treated his captives with great humanity",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa

Sethon now applied to his foldiers, but in vain: they unanimoufly perfifted in refufing to march under his banner.

Perhaps, indeed, his defign originally was rather to pillage than to con¬ quer ; and therefore, on his return, his vaft empire va- niftied at once. Pfammitichus, however, endeavoured to extend his dominions by making war on his neigh¬ bours ; but by putting more confidence in foreign auxi¬ liaries than in his own fubjedts, the latter were fo much offended, that upwards of 200,000 fighting men emigrated in a body, and took up their relidence in Ethiopia. To repair this lofs, Pfammitichus earneftly applied himfelf to the advancement of commerce ; and opened his ports to all ftrangers, whom he greatly ca- reffed, contrary to the cruel maxims of his predecef- fors, who refufed to admit them into the country.

Apries complied with his requeft, and fent a powerful army to his relief. jj The Egyptians were defeated with great ftaught- r; and thofe who returned complained that the army had been fent off by Apries in order to be deitroyee, and that he might tyrannize without controul over the remain¬ der of his fubjeCts.

Apries fent one Amafis, a particular friend, in whom he thought he could confide, to bring back his people to a lenfe of their duty. But by this friend he was betrayed ; for Amafis, taking the op¬ portunity of the prefent ferment, cauled himfelf to be proclaimed king. Apries then defpatched one Patar- bemis, with orders to take Amafis, and bring him alive before him. This he found impoflible, and therefore returned without his prifoner ; at which the king was foenragtd, that he commanded Patarbemis’s noie and ears to be cut off. This piece of cruelty completed his ruin ; for when the reft of the Egyptians who con¬ tinued faithful to Apries beheld the inhuman mutila¬ tion of fo worthy and noble a perfon as Patarbemis was, they to a man deferted Apries, and went over to Amafis",Sidon,"LY,EG,LB",5,"Libya,Egypt,Lebanon","Africa,Africa,Asia"
"He confined Apries in one of his palaces, but treated him with great care and refpeft. The people, how¬ ever, were implacable, and could not be fatisfied while he enjoyed his life. Amafis, therefore, at laft found himfelf obliged to deliver him into their hands. Thus the predi<5tion received its final completion : Apries was delivered up to thofe who fought his life; and who no fooner had him in their power, than they ftrangled him, and laid his body in the fepulchre of his ancef- tors . ,p1Jjn_ During thefe inteftine broils, which muft have great- • ed by ly weakened the kingdom, it is probable that Nebu- • buchad- chadnezzar invaded Egypt. He had been for 13 years i zar. before this employed in befieging Tyre, and at laft had nothing but an empty city for his pains. To make himfelf fome amends, therefore, he entered Egypt, mi- ferably haralfed the country, killed and carried away great numbers of the inhabitants, fo that the country did not recover from the effefts of this incurfion for a long time after. In this expedition, however, he feems not to have aimed at any permanent conqueft, but to have been induced to it merely by the love of plunder, and of this he carried with him an immenfe quantity to s Babylon",Tyre,"EG,LB",5,"Egypt,Lebanon","Africa,Asia"

That good order might be kept la^16, among fuch vaft numbers of people, Amafis enabled a law, by which every Egyptian was bound once a-year to inform the governor of his province by what means he gained his livelihood ; and if he failed of this, to put him to death. The fame puniftiment he decreed to thofe who could not give a fatisfa&ory account of themfelves",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"This monarch wTas a great favourer of the Greeks, and married a woman of Grecian extrafl. To many Greek cities, as well as particular perfons, he made confiderable prefents.

"■ends This great profperity, however, ended with the death mbytes of Amafis, or indeed before it. The Egyptian mo- rla°^ narch had fome how or other incenfed Cambyfes king of Perfia. The caufe of the quarrel is uncertain ; but whatever it was, the Perfian monarch vowed the de- ftrufl i' n of Amafis.

"At this dangerous crifis alfo, the Egyptian monarch And Po!y- imprudently made Polycrates the tyrant of Samos hiscrates ty- enemy. This man had been the moll remarkable per haps of any recorded in hiftory, for an uninterrupted courfe of fuccefs, without the intervention of one lingle unfortunate event. Amafis, who was at this time in ftrift alliance with Polycrates, wrote him a letter, in which, after congratulating him on his profperity, he told him that he was afraid left his fuccefles were to® many, and he might be fuddenly thrown down into the greateft mifery. For this reafon he advifed him voluntarily to take away fomething from his own hap- pinefs ; and to call away that which would grieve him moft if he was accidentally to lofe it. Polycrates fol¬ lowed his advice, and threw into the fea a fignet of ineftimable value. This, however, did not anfwer the intended purpofe. The fignet happened to be fwal- lowed by a fifh, which was taken a few days after¬ wards, and thus wTas reftored to Polycrates. Of this Amafis was no fooner informed, than, confidering Po¬ lycrates as really unhappy, and already on the brink of deftru6fion, he refolved to put an end to the friendlhip which fubfifted between them. For this purpofe he defpatched a herald to Samos, commanding him to acquaint Polycrates, that he renounced his alliance, and all the obligations between them •, that he might not mourn his misfortunes with the furrow of a friend",Of,"TR,EG",5,"Turkey,Egypt","Asia,Africa"
"Thus Amafis left Polycrates at liberty to a6t againft him, if he chnfe to do fo ; and accordingly he offered to aflift Cambyfes with a fleet of (hips in his Egyptian expedition",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Amafis had not, however, the misfortune to fee the calamities of his country. He died about 525 years before Chrift, after a reign of 44 years ; and left the 2I kingdom to his fun Pfammenitus, juft as Cambyfes was Egypt in- approaching the frontiers of the kingdom. The newvadedby prince was fcarce feated on the throne, when the Per-(-'amhy^es* fians appeared. Pfammenitus drew together what forces he could, in order to prevent them from entering the kingdom. Cambyfes, howmver, immediately laid liege to Pelufium, and made himfelf mafter of it by the fol¬ lowing ftratagem : he placed in the front of his army a great number of cats, dogs, and other animals that were deemed facred by the Egyptians.

"The rapid fuccefs of the Perfians ftruck with fuch terror the Libyans, Cyreneans, Barcseans, and other dependents or allies of the Egyptian monarch, that they immediately fubmitted. Nothing now remained bur to difpofe of the captive king, and revenge on him and his fubjefls the cruelties which they had commit¬ ted. This the mercilefs vidflor executed in the fevereft manner. On the 10th day after Memphis had been taken, Pfammenitus and the chief of the Egyptian no¬ bility were ignominioufly fent into one of the fuburbs of that city. The king being there feated in a pro¬ per place, faw his daughter coming along in the habit of a-poor flave with a pitcher to fetch water from the river, and followed by the daughters of the greateft families in Egypt, all in the fame miferable garb, with pitchers in their hands, drowned in tears, and loudly bemoaning their miferable fituation. When the fathers faw their daughters in this diftrefs, they burft into tears, all but Pfammenitus, who only caft his eyes on the ground and kept them fixed there. After the young women, came the fon of Pfammenitus, with 2000 of the young nobility, all of them with bits in their mouths and halters round their necks, led to execution. This was done to expiate the murder of the Perfian herald and the Mitylenean failors ; for Cambyfes caufed ten Egyptians of the firft rank to be publicly executed for every one of thofe that had been flain. Pfammenitus, however, obferved the fame conduft as before, keep¬ ing his eyes ftedfaftly fixed on the ground, though all the Egyptians around him made the loudeft lamenta¬ tions. A little after this he faw an intimate friend and companion, now advanced in years, who having been plundered of all he had, was begging his bread from door to door in the fuburbs. As foon as he faw this man, Pfammenitus wept bitterly *, and calling out to him by his name, ftruck himfelf on the head as if be had been frantic. Of this the fpies who had been fet over him to obferve his behaviour, gave immediate no¬ tice to Cambyfes, who thereupon fent a mefl'enger to inquire the caufe of fuch immoderate grief. Pfamme¬ nitus anfwered, That the calamities of his own family confounded him, and were too great to be lamented by any outward figns of grief ^ but the extreme diftrefs of a bofom friend gave more room for reflexion, and therefore extorted tears from him.

"“ Ptolemy Euergetes, having received from his father the fevereignty of Egypt, Libya, Syria, Phoenice, Cyprus, Lycia, Caria, and the other Cyclades, affem- bled a mighty army of horfe and foot, with a gi-eat fteet, and elephants, out of 1 rogloditia and Ethiopia 5 lome of which had been taken by his father, and the reft by ‘ himfelf, and brought from thence, and trained up for war : with this great force he failed into Afia j and having conquered all the provinces which lie on this fide the Euphrates, Cilicia, Parephylia, Ionia, the Ktl- lefpont, and Thrace, he crofted the river with ""11 the forces of the conquered countries, and the kings of thofe nations, and reduced Mefopotamia, Babylonia, Sufiana, Perfia, Media, and all the country as far as Baclria.” On the king’s return from this expedition, he paffed through. Jerufaletn, where he offered many facrifices to the God of Ifrael, and ever afterwards expreffed a great favour for the Jewifti nation. At this time, the jews were tributaries to the Egyptian monarchs, and paid them annually 20 talents of filver. This tribute, however, Onias, who was then high prieft, being of a very covetous difpofitkm, had for a long time negle<fled to pay, fo that the arrears amounted to a very large lorn. Soon after his return, therefore, Ptolemy fent one cf his courtiers named Athenian to -demand the money, and defired him to acquaint^ the Jews that he would make war upon them in cale of a refuial. A young man, however, named Jofeph^ nephew to U- nias, not only found means to avert the king’s anger, but even got himfelf chofen his receiver-general, and by his faithful difeharge of that important truft, con¬ tinued in high favour with Ptolemy as long as he lived. , Ptolemy Euergetes having at laft concluded a peace with Seleucus the fucceffor of Antiochus Theus king of Syria, attempted the enlargement of his dominions on the fouth fide. In this he was attended with fuch fuccefs, that he made himfelf mafter of all the coafts of the Red fea, both on the Arabian and Ethiopian fides, quite down to the ftraits of Babelraandel. On his re¬ turn he-was met by ambafladors from the Acheeans, im¬ ploring his afliftance againft the Etolians and Lacedae¬ monians. This the king readily promifed them : but they having in the mean time engaged Antigonus king of Macedon to fupport them, Ptolemy was fo much of¬ fended, that he fent powerful fuccours to Cleomenes king of Sparta ; hoping, by that means,, to humble both the Achaeans and their new ally Antigonus. In this, however, he was difappointed , for Cleomenes, af- Cleornenes- ter having gained very confiderable advantages over the enemy, was at laft entirely defeated in the battle ®f r(j^u ^ Sellafia, and obliged to take refuge in Ptolemy’s domi-Egypt< nions. He was received by the Egyptian monarch with the greateft demonftrations 01 kindnefs, a yeatiy penfion of 24 talents was aftigned him, with a promife of reftoring him to the Spartan throne ; but before this could be accomplilhed, the king of Egypt died, in the 27th year of his reign, and was fucceeded by his fon Ptolemy Philopater",,"EG,SY,ET,LY,CY",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic,Ethiopia,Libya,Cyprus","Africa,Asia,Africa,Africa,Asia"

But after the death of Ptolemy Euergetes, the Egyptian empire being governed only by weak or vicious monarchs, quickly declined, and from that time makes no confpicuous figure in hiftory. ^ Ptolemy Philopater began his reign with the murder Ptolemy of his brother ; after which, giving himfelf up to all Philopater manner of licentioufnefs, the kingdom fell into a kind ^crud ty-- of anarchy.

"Extraordi- During the reign of Philopater happened a very ex- nary ftory traordinary event with regard to the Jews, which is the raenti°ned in the Maccabees*. The king of Egypt, * Lib iii. 2. while his Syrian expedition, had attempted to en- 3, 4, 5. ter the temple of Jeruialem ; but being hindered by the Jews, he was filled with the utmoft rage againft the whole nation. On his return to Alexandria, he refolved to make thofe who dwelt in that city feel the firft effects of his vengeance. He began with publifh- ing a decree, which he caufed to be engraved on a pillar eredfed for that purpofe at the gate of his palace, ex¬ cluding all thofe who did not facrifice to the gods wor- ftiipned by the king. By this means the Jews were debarred from fuing to him for juftice, or obtaining his prote£l:ion when they happened to ftand in need of it. By the favour of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Soter, and Euergetes, the Jews enjoyed at Alexandria the fame privileges with the Macedonians. In that metropolis the inhabitants were divided into three ranks or claffes. In the firft were the Macedonians, the original founders of the city, and along with them were enrolled the Jews ; in the fecond were the mer¬ cenaries who had ferved under Alexander 5 and in the third the native Egyptians. Ptolemy now, to be revenged of the Jews, ordered, by another decree, that they ftiould be degraded from the firft rank, and enrolled among the native Egyptians. By the fame decree it was ena&ed, that all of that nation fliould ap¬ pear at an appointed time before the proper officers, in order to be enrolled among the common people; that at the time of their enrollment they ffiould have the mark of an ivy leaf, the badge of Bacchus, imprefled with a hot iron on their faces ; that all who were thus marked ftiould be made flaves ; and, laftly, that if any one ftiould ftand out againft this decree, he ftiould be immediately put to death. That he might not, how¬ ever, feem an enemy to the whole nation, he declared, that thofe who facrificed to their gods ftiould enjoy their former privileges, and remain in the fame clafs.

But however this was, the Alexandrians de- fpairing of his ever being able to recover his liberty, raifed to the throne his brother Ptolemy, who took the name of Euergetes II. but was afterwards called Phyfcon or “ the great-bellied,” on account of the prominent belly which by his gluttony and luxury he had acquir¬ ed. He was fcarce feated on the throne, however, when Antiochus Epiphanes, returning into Egypt, drove out Phyfcon, and reftored the whole kingdom except Pelufiura, to Philometor.

They next made themfelves mailers of Alex¬ andria ; and, after that, overran all the Upper Egypt",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Saladin was left with a confiderable garrifon in Alexan¬ dria ; but Afadoddin was no fooner gone, than the crufaders laid fiege to that city. This at laft obliged Afadoddin to return to its relief. The great Ioffes he had fuflained in this expedition probably occafioned his agreeing to a treaty with Shawer, by which he engaged to retire out of Egypt, upon being paid a fum of money",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Afadoddin was no fooner gone, than Shawer enter¬ ed into a frefh treaty with the Franks. By this new alliance he was to attack Nuroddiri in his own domi¬ nions, as he was at that time engaged in quelling fome revolters, which would effe&ually prevent his fending any more forces into Egypt. This treaty fo provoked the Syrian prince, that he refolved to fufpend his other conquefts for fome time, and exert his whole ftrength in the conqueft of Egypt",,"EG,SY",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic","Africa,Asia"
"Bv this time the crufaders had reduced Pelufium, and made a confiderable progrefs in the kingdom, as well as in fome other countries, through the divifions which reigned among the Mahometan princes. In fuch places as they conquered, they put almoft every body to the fword ; Chriftians as well as Mahometans; felling their prifoners for {laves, and giving up the towns to be plundered by the foldiers. From Pelu¬ fium they marched to Cairo •, which was then in no porture of defence, and in the utmofl confufion, by reafon of the divifions which reigned in it. Shawer, therefore, as foon as he heard of their approach, cau- fed the ancient quarter called Mefr to be fet on fire, and the inhabitants to retire into the other parts. He alfo prevailed upon the caliph to folicit the affiflance of Nuroddin ; which the latter was indeed pretty much inclined of himfelf to grant, as it gave him the fairell opportunity he could have wiibed for, both of driving the crufaders out of Egvpt, and of feizing the king¬ dom to himfelf. For this purpofe he had already raifed an army of 60,000 horfe under his general Afadoddin; and, on the receipt of Al Aded’s meffage, gave them orders to fet out immediately. The crufaders were now arrived at Cairo; and had fo clofely befieged that place, that neither Shawer nor the caliph knew any thing of the approach of the Modem army which was haftening to their relief.

Shawer alfo, confcious of his perfidious condudl, was no lefs affiduous in attending pundlually upon him. But having invited the general and fome others to an entertainment, he had formed a fcheme of having them feized and murdered. The plot, however, being difcovered, Shawer himfelf had his head cut off, and Afadoddin was made vizir in his Head. He did not, however, long enjoy his new dignity j for he died two months and five days after his inftalment, being fucceeded in his office of vizir by his nephew Sala-Sahcfin b» din. comes vizi The new vizir was the youngeft of all the grandees°f Egypt, who afpired to that office, but had already given fome fignal proofs of his valour and conduft. What deter¬ mined the caliph to prefer him to all the reft is not known; but it is certain that fome of them were highly difpleafed with his promotion, and even publicly de¬ clared that they would not obey him. In order to gain thefe to his intereft, therefore, Saladin found it necef- fary to diftribute among the m part of the vaft treafures left by his uncle ; by which means he foon governed Egypt without controul, as bad been cuftomary with the vizirs for fome time before. Soon after his being inftalled into the office of vizir, he gave a total defeat to the negroes who guarded the royal palace, and had oppofed his eledlion ; by which means, and a ftrong garrifon he had placed in the caftle of Cairo, his power became firmly eftabliffied. Though he had not the leaft intention of continuing in his allegiance to Nu¬ roddin, he did not think it prudent at firft to declare himfelf. He fent for his father, however, and the reft of his family, who were in Nuroddin’s dominions, in order, as he faid, to makp them partakers of his gran¬ deur and happinefs. Nuroddin did not think proper to deny this requert ; though, being already jealous of the great power of Saladin, he infilled that his family ffiould confider him only as one of his generals in E- gypt- A good underftanding fubfifted between Nuroddin and Saladin for fome time, which did not a little con¬ tribute to raife the credit of the latter with the Egyp¬ tians. In 1169, Nuroddin fent him orders to omit the name of Al Aded, the caliph of Egypt, in the pu¬ blic prayers, and fubftitute that of the caliph of Bagdad in its place. This uas at any rate a dangerous at¬ tempt ; as it might very readily produce a revolt in fa¬ vour of Al Aded: or if it did not, it gave Saladin an opportunity of engroffing even that fmall remnant of power which was left to the caliph. Al Aded, how¬ ever, was not fenfible of his difgrace; for he was onSeizesAe his deathbed, and part recovery, when Nuroddin’s or-effe<Ssof ders were executed. After his death, Saladin feized on1*16 ca^ all his wealth and valuable effedls; which confifted of jewels of prodigious fize, fumptuous furniture, a library containing teyp1' 84 )ire$ to crown",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Saladin was now arrived at the higheft pitch of wealth, power, and grandeur. He was, however, ob¬ liged to behave with great circumfpedlion with regard to Nuroddin : who ftill continued to treat him as his vaffal, and would not fuffer him to difpute the leall of his commands. He relied for advice chiefly on his fa¬ ther Ayub who was a confummate politician, and very ambitious of feeing bis fon raifed to the throne of Egypt. He therefore advifed Saladin to continue fted- faft in his refolutions ; and, whilft he amufed Nuroddin with feigned fubmiflions, to take every method in his power to fecure himfelf in the pofleflion of fo valuable a kingdom. Nuroddin himfelf, however, was too great a mailer in the art of diflimulation to be eafily impofed on by others ; and therefore, though he pretended to be well pleafed with Saladin’s conduct, he was all this time raifing a powerful army, with which he was fully determined to invade Egypt the following year. But while he meditated this expedition, he was feized with a quinfyat the caftle of Darnafcus, which put an end to his life, in the year uyfl* Saladin, though now freed from the apprehenfions of fuch a formidable enemy, dared not venture to af- futne the title of Sovereign, while he faw the fucceffor of Nuroddin at the head of a very powerful army, and no lefs defirous than able to difpoffefs him. For this reafon his firll care was to fecure to himfelf an afylum, in cafe he thould be obliged to leave Egypt altogether",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"After this good fortune, Saladin, now fare of a con¬ venient place of refuge in cafe of any misfortune, af¬ firmed the title of Sultan or fovereign of Egypt j and was acknowledged as fuch by the greater part of the flates. The zeal of the Egyptians for the Fatemite caliphs, however, foon produced a rebellion. One AY Kanx, or Kan%anaddowla, governor of a city in Upper Egypt, alTembled a great army of blacks, or rather fwarthy natives j and marching diredtly into the lower country, was there joined by great numbers of other Egyptians. Againft them Saladin defpatched his bro¬ ther Malek, who foon defeated and entirely difperfed them.

Saladin, however, marched to the relief of the city with fuch furprifing expedition, that the crufaders were feizt d with a hidden panic, and fled with the utmoft precipita¬ tion, leaving all their military engines, ftores, and bag¬ gage behind.   87 In the year 1175, the inhabitants of Damafcus beg-Saladin ged of Saladin to accept the fovereignty of that city and its dependencies*, being jealous of the minifter, mafCU3t who had the tuition of the reigning prince, and who governed all with an abfolute fvvay. The application was no fooner made, than the fultan fet out with the utmoft celerity to Damaicus, at the head of a chofen detachment of 700 horfe. Having fettled his affairs in that city, he appointed his brother Saif A1 Iflam go¬ vernor of it j and fet out for Hems, to which he imme¬ diately laid fiege.

"In 1176 Saladin returned from the conqueft of Syria, and made his triumphal entry into Cairo. Here, hav¬ ing refled himfelf and his troops for fome time, he began to encompafs the city with a wall^ 29,000 cubits in length, but which he did not live to finilh. Next year he led a very numerous army into Palefline a- gainft the crufaders. But here his ufual good fortune failed him. His army was entirely defeated. Forty thoufand of his men were left dead on the field j and the reft fled with fo much precipitation, that, having no towns in the neighbourhood where they could (bel¬ ter themfelves, they traverfed the vaft defert between Paleftine and Egypt, and fcarce flopped till they teached the capital itfelf. The greateft part of the army by this means periflied ; and as no water was to be had in the defert above mentioned, almoft all the beads died of third before the fugitives arrived on the confines of Egypt. Saladin himfelf feemed to have been greatly intimidated 5 for in a letter to his brother A1 Malek, he told him, that “ he was more than once in the moft imminent danger •, and that God, as he ap¬ prehended, had delivered him from thence, in order to referve him for the execution of fome grand and impor¬ tant defign.” In the year 1182, the fultan fet out on an expedi¬ tion to Syria with a formidable army, amidft the accla¬ mations and good vvifties of the people.

Notwithftand- ing all this, he told him, he would grant him his life, if he would embrace Mahometanifm. This condition, however, was refufed *, and the fultan, with one ftroke of his fcimitar, cut off the prince’s head.

This proved the means of preferving that city, and alfo of re-eftablifhing their affairs for the prefent.

"In 1193 Saladin died, to the inexpreffible grief of all true Mahometans, who held him in the utmoft ve¬ neration. His dominions in Syria and Paleftine were ftiared out among his children and relations into many petty principalities. His fon Othman fucceeded to the crown of Egypt ; but as none of his fucceffors pnffeffcd the enterprifing genius of Saladin, the hiitoiy from that time till the year 1250 affords nothing re- ^ markable. At this time the reigning fultan Malek A1 Mamlouk: Salek was dethroned and {lain by the Mame/ucs or Mam-becomt /ouks, as they are called, a kind of mercenary ioldiers“ia^ers^ who ferved under him. In confequence of this revolu- ’ tion, the Mamlouks became mailers of Egypt, and, chofe a fultan from among themfelves.—rI hefe Mam¬ louks are thought to have been young Turks or Tar¬ tars, fold to private perfons by the merchants, irom whom they were bought by the fullan, educated at his expence, and employed to defend the maritime places of the kingdom. The reafon of this inflitution origi¬ nally was, that the native Egyptians were become fo cowardly, treacherous, and effeminate, Irom a long cnurfe of flavery, that they were unfit for arms. 1 he Mamlouks, on the contrary, made moft excellent fol¬ diers } for having no friends but amongit their own corps, they turned all their thoughts to their own proteffion. ^ According to M. Volney, they came originally frem ^ccount Mount Caucafus, and are diftinguiffied by the flaxen them, colour of their hair. Here they were found by the crulader, and were by them called Mame/ucs, or more corn 611y Mamlouks The expedition of the Tartars in 1227 proved indiredlly the means of introducing them into Egypt. Thefe horrible conquerors, having flaugh- tered and maffacred tils they were weary, brought along with them an immenfe number of flaves o{ both {exes, with whom they filled all the markets in Afia. The Turks, taking advantage of the opportunity, purehafed about 12,000 young men, whom they bred up in the profeffion of arms, in which they foon attained to great perfection ; but becoming mutinous, like the Roman pretorian bands, :hey turned their arms again!! their mafter*, and in 1250 depoitd and murdered the caliph, as has been already related",Roman,"EG,SY,RO",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic,Romania","Africa,Asia,Europe"
"The Mamiouks having got poffeffion of the govern¬ ment, and neither underiianding nor putting a value upon any thing befides the art of war, every fpecies of learning decayed in Egypt, and a great degree of bar- barifm was introduced.

"The Borgites, as well as the former, affumed the name of Mamlouis; and were famous for their valour and ferocity of condufl. They were almoft perpetu¬ ally engaged in wars either foreign or domellic $ and their dominion lafted till the year 1517, when they were invaded by Selim the Turkirti fultan. The Mamlouks defended themft'lves with incredible valour ; notwith- ftanding which, being overpowered by numbers, they u'ere defeated in every engagement. The fame year, their capital, the city of Cairo, was taken, with a ter¬ rible flaughter of thofe who defended it. I he fultan was forced to flv *, and, having colle&ed all his force, ventured a decifive battle. The moft romantic efforts of valour, however, were infufficient to cope with the innumerable multitude which compofed the 'furkith army. Moft of bis men were cut in pieces, and the un¬ happy prince himfelf was at laft obliged to take (belter in a marfh. He was dragged from his hiding-place, where he had flood up to the (boulders in water, and foon after put to death. With him ended the glory, and almoft the exiftence, of the Mamlouks, who were now everywhere fearcbed for and cut in pieces",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"This was the laft great revolution in the Egyptian affairs: a revolution very little to the advantage of the natives, who may well doubt whether their ancient or modern conquerors have behaved with the greater de¬ gree of barbarity. Selim gave a fpecimen of his go¬ vernment, the very day after his being put in full pof- feftion of it, by the death of Tuman Bey the unfortunate fultan above mentioned. Having ordered a theatre to be erefted with a throne upon it on the banks of the Nile, he caufed all the prifoners, upwards of 30,000 in number, to be beheaded in his prefenee, and their bodies thrown into the river",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa

With this view, he chofe from among the Mamlouks who had efcaped the general maffacre a divan, or council of regency, confiding of the pacha and chiefs of the feven military corps. The former was to notify to this council the orders of the Porte, to fend the tribute to Conftantinople, and provide for the fafety of government both external and internal j while, on the other hand, the members of the council had a right to rejedt the orders of the pacha, or even of depofing him, provided they could affign fufficient reaLns. All civil and political ordinances muft alfo be ratified by them. Befides this, he formed the whole body into a republic ; for which purpofe he iffued an edidt to the ro^ following purpofe: “ Though, by the help of the Al-HisediA mighty, we have conquered the whole kingdom of E-forare- gypt with our invincible armies ; neverthelefs our bene-Pubhc",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa

"“ Given and figned by our clemency to the republic of Egypt.” Thus the power of the Mamlouks ftill continued in a very confiderable degree, and by degrees increafed fo much as to threaten a total lofs of dominion to the Turks. During the laft 50 years, the Porte having relaxed from its vigilance, fuch a revolution has taken place, that the Turkifh power is now almoft reduced to nothing. But in order to underftand this, we mult confider the way in which the race of Mamlouks is continued or multiplied in Egypt. This is not in the ordinary way, by marriage : on the contrary, M. Vol- ney affures us, that “ during 350 years in which there have been Mamlouks in Egypt, not one of them has left fubfifting iflue : all their children perifli in the firrt or fecond defeent. Almoft the fame thing holds good with regard to the Turks j and it is obferved, that they can only fecure the continuance of their families by marrying women who are natives, which the Mam¬ louks have always difdained. The means by which they are perpetuated and multiplied are the fame by which they were firft eftabliftied, viz. by flaves brought from their original country. From the time of the Moguls this commerce has been continued on the banks of the Cuban and Phafis in the fame manner as it is carried on in Africa, by the wars among the ho- ilile tribes, and the mifery or avarice of the inhabi¬ tants, who fell their children to ftrangers. The flaves thus procured are firft brought to Conftantinople, and afterwards difperfed through the empire, where they are purchafed by the wealthy. When the Turks fub- dued Egypt (fays M. Volney), they (hould undoubtedly have prohibited this dangerous traffic •, their omitting which feems about to difpoffefs them of their conqueft, and which feveral political errors have long been pre¬ paring.",,"EG,CU",5,"Egypt,Cuba","Africa,North America"
"From that moment the beys acquired an afcendancy over the foldiers, who till then had treated them with difdain •, and this could not but continually intreafe, fince their governments procured them confiderable riches. Thefe they employed in creating themfelves friends and creatures. They multiplied their flaves ; and after emancipating them, employed all their intereft to promote them to various employments, and advance them in the army. Thefe upftarts, retaining for their patrons the fame fuperftitious veneration common in the Eaft, formed fa&ions implicitly devoted to their plea- fure.” Thus, about the year 1746, Ibrahim, one ofAuthorit the kiayas (d) of the janizaries, rendered himfelf inufurPedl reality mafter of Egypt ; having managed matters fo^rahlm well, that of the 24 beys or fangiacs eight were of his houfehold. His influence too was augmented by alwavs leaving vacancies in order to enjoy the emoluments him¬ felf j while the officers and foldiers of his corps were attached to his intereft : and his power was completed by gaining over I^odoan, the moft powerful of all the colonels, to his intereft. Thus the pacha became alto¬ gether unable to oppofe him, and the orders of the ful- tan were lefs rtfpecled than thofe of Ibrahim. On his death in 1757, his family, i. e. his enfranchifed flaves, continued to rule in a defpotic manner.

It is moft commonly fuppofed, however, that Ali Bey was born among the Abazans, a people of Mount Caucafus 5 from whom next to the Circaffians, the Haves moft valued by the Turks, and other nations who deal in that commodity, are to be ob¬ tained. Having been brought to a public fale at Cairo, He Ali Bey was bought by two Jew brothers named Ifaac bought ar and Youfef, who made a prefent of him to Ibrahimeducated r Kiaya",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa

On this he appeared fuddenly in that city •, and in one night killed four of the beys who were inimical to his defigns, banhhed the reft, and affumed the whole power to him¬ felf. Still, however, his ambition was not fatisfied ; and he determined on nothing lefs than to throw off his dependence on the Porte altogether, and become fultan of Egypt.

"The Porte being at that time on the eve of a danger¬ ous war with Ruffia, had not leifure to attend to the proceedings of Ali Bey ; fo that the latter had an op¬ portunity of going forward with his enterprifes very .comes vigoroufly.

With this view, he fitted out fome veffels at Suez ; and manning them with Mamlouks, commanded the bey Haflan to fail with them to Jedda, and feize upon it, while a body of cavalry under Mohammed Bey advanced againft the town.

Thus Ali Bey found him¬ felf at once deprived of all his expectations of con- quelt 5 and what was worfe, found a traitor whom he durll not punifli at the head of his forces. A fudden reverfe of fortune now took place. Several vefl'els laden with corn for Sheik Daher were taken by a Ruflian privateer 5 and Mohammed Bey, whom he defigned to have put to death, not only made his efcape, but was fo well attended that he could not be attacked. His fol¬ lowers continuing daily to increafein number, Moham¬ med foon became fafficiently flrong to march towards Cairo; and, in the month of April 1772, having de- 117 feated the troops of Ali in a rencounter, entered the He is driven city fword in hand, while the latter had fcarce time to Cairo and ^ efcaPe 800 Mamlouks. With difficulty he was enabled to get to Syria by the affiflance of Sheik Daher, whom he immediately joined with the troops he had with him.

"Confiding in thefe promifes, Ali Bey imprudently fet out with his Mamlouks and 1 500 Safadians given him by Daher; but had no fooner entered the defert which feparates Gaza from Egypt, than he was attacked by a body of 1000 chofen Mamlouks who were lying in wait for his arrival. They were commanded by a young bey, named Mourad; who being enamoured of the wife of Ali Bey, had obtained a promife of her from Mohammed, in cafe he could bring him her hufband’s head. As foon as Mourad perceived the dull by which the approach of Ali Bey’s army was announced, he rufhed upon him, attacked, and took prifoner Ali Bey himfelf, after wounding him in the forehead with a fa- bre. Being conduced to Mohammed Bey, the latter pretended to treat him with extraordinary refpeft, and ordered a magnificent tent to be eredled for him ; but in three days he was found dead of his w'ounds, as was given out; though fome affirm, perhaps with equal rea- fon, that Ije was poifoned",Gaza,"EG,PS",5,"Egypt,Palestine, State of","Africa,Asia"
"After the death of Ali Bey, Mohammed Bey tookisfucceed upon him the fupreme dignity; but this change of by Mohai mailers proved of very little fervice to the Egyptians.med At firft he pretended to be only the defender of the rights of the fultan, remitted the ufual tribute to Con- ftantinople, and took the cuftomary oath of unlimited obedience ; after which he folicited permiffion to make War upon Sheik Daher, the ally of Ali Bey. The reafon of this requefl was a mere perfonal pique ; and' as foon as it was granted, he made the moft diligent preparations for war. Having procured an extraordi¬ nary train of artillery, he provided foreign gunners, and gave the command of them to an Englifhman named j2i Robinjbn. He brought from Suez a cannon 16 feet His exped long, which had for a confiderable time remained ufe-'tionaga‘‘ lefs; and at length, in the month of February i776,Shtjik he appeared in Syria with an army equal in number to a that which he had formerly commanded when in the fervice of Ali Bey. Daher’s forces, defpairing of be¬ ing able to cope with fuch a formidable armament, abandoned Gaza, which Mohammed immediately took pofieffion of, and then marched towards a fortified town named Yafa.

Sheik Daher himfelf fled, and Mohammed foon became mafter of Acre alfo",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Here he behaved with his ufual cruelty, and abandoned the city to be plundered by his foldiers. The French merchants claimed an exemption, and it was procured with the utmoft difficulty : nor was even this likely to be of any confequence j for Mohammed, informed that the treafures of Ibrahim kiaya of Daher had been de- pofited in that place, made an immediate demand of them, threatening every one of the merchants with death 124 if the treafures were not inftantly produced.

This gave fuch offence to Morad, who fufpedted fume plot againft himfelf, that he left Cairo. A war betwixt the two rivals was now daily expelled, and the armies continued for 25 days in fight of tach other, only fepa- rated by the river. Negociations took place ; and the five exiled beys, finding themfelVes abandoned by Mo¬ rad, took to flight, but were purfued and brought back to Cairo. Peace feeraed now to be re-ettablifhed ; but the jealoufy of the two rivals producing new in¬ trigues, Morad was once more obliged to leave Cairo in 1784. Forming his camp, however, directly at the gates of the city, he appeared fo terrible to Ibrahim, that.the latter thought proper in his turn to retire to the defert, where he remained till March 1785.

This great extent of country, from the kingdom of Barca to Gaza, is ei¬ ther overflowed by the river, or capable of being fo $ ■which thus fertilizes in a high degree a trafl of coun¬ try feemingiy devoted to perpetual barrennefs on ac¬ count of the want of rain and the heat of the cli¬ mate.’' According to the teftimonxes of both Mr Bruce andfoaft 0f]| M.

"The earth no longer watered, and continually expofed to the burning ardour of the fun, is converted into a barren land. In thofe places where formerly were feen rich fields and flourilhing towns, on the Pelufiac, the Tari&ic, and the Mendefian branches, which all ftrike out from the canal of Damielta, nothing is to be found at this day but a few miferable hamlets, furrounded by date trees and by deferts. Thefe once navigable canals are rtow no more than a vain refemblance ot what they were: they have no communication with the lake Men- zall, but what is merely temporary, on the fwelling of the Nile ; they are dry the remainder of the year. By deepening them by removing the mud depofited by the river fince the Turks have made themfelves mafters of Egypt, the country they pafs through would be again fertilized, and the Delta recover a third of its great- nefs.” np Concerning this ifland it has been the opinion of aSavary’s great many, even from very ancient times, that it wasacc0*^M produced by the mud brought down by the inunda-jj^ tions of the Nile : and this opinion we find adopted in (jelta",Delta,"EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"the flrongeft manner by M. Savary. His account of the fuppofed rife of the. Delta, and indeed of the greateft part of Egypt, is to the following purpofe",Delta,"EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"In E G Y [ 617 ] E G Y t In thofe early ages where hiftory has not fixed any epoch, a certain people defcended from the mountains near the catarafts into the valley overflowed by the Nile, and which w'as then an uninhabitable morafs overgrown with reeds and canes. In what manner, or from what motive, thefe people were induced to defcend from their ancient habitations to fuch a place, or how they found means to penetrate into a morafs which he exprefsly tells us was impenetrable, we are not informed, neither is it to our prefent purpofe to inquire. At that time, however, the fea bathed the feet of thofe mountains where the pyramids are built, and advanced far into Libya. It covered alfo part of the ifthmus of Suez, and every part of what we now call the Delta formed a great gulf. After many ages the Egyptians, by what means is unknown, at leait not fpecified by our author (though they ought to have been fo, as the country it feems was then overflowed not only by the river but by the ocean), formed canals to carry off the ftagnant waters of the Nile j oppofed ftrong dykes to its ravages j and, tired of dwelling in the caverns of rocks, built towns and cities upon (pots elevated either by nature or art. Already the river was kept within its bounds, the habitations of men were out of the reach of its inundations, and experience had taught the peo¬ ple to forefee and announce them. One of the kings of Egypt undertook to change the courfe of the river","Suez, Delta","EG,LY,CA",5,"Egypt,Libya,Canada","Africa,Africa,North America"
"After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an unfarmountable obftacle to the right, it turned fuddenly to the left j and taking its courfe to the fouthward of Memphis, it fpread its waters through the fands of Libya. The prince we fpeak of caufed a new bed to be dug for it to the eaft of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and difcharge itfelf into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the caftle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was flill to be feen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day acrofs the deferts, pafling to the weft- ward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs ftill beftow upon it the name of Bahr Be/ama, “ or fea without wa¬ ter,” and it is now almoft choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A reflux of the fea was occafioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themfelves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the fands and mud carried along with them were colledled into heaps ; and thus the Delta, at firft very inconfiderable, rofe out of the fea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has fince been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raifing dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to He¬ rodotus, the Delta was in its infancy ; eight cubits of water being then fufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats paffed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial emi¬ nences, refembled the iflands of the Egean fea. At the time that Herodotus vifited this country, 15 cubits ■were neceffary to cover all the Lower Egypt ; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the fpace of two days journey to the right and left of the ifland.

Sometimes, s—-y--— however, the Nile rifes to 22 cubits ; and the caufe of this phenomenon is the mud for fo many years accu¬ mulated on the ifland. Here, in the fpace of 3284 years, we fee the Delta elevated 14 cubits. Our author wrote in 1777, and informs us that he twice made the tour of the ifland during the time of the inundation","Cairo, Delta","EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"“ The river (fays he) flowed in full ftreams in the great branches of Rofetta and Damietta, as well as in thofe which pafs through the interior part of the country ; but it did not overflow the lands, except in the lower parts, where the dykes were pierced for the purpofe of watering the plantations of rice. We muft not, how¬ ever, imagine, as feveral travellers pretend, that this ifland will continue to rife, and that it will become un¬ fruitful. As it owes its increafe to the annual fettling of the mud conveyed thither by the Nile, when itceafes to be overflowed it will no longer increafe in height, for it is demonftrated that culture is not fufficient to raife land. ** “ It is natural to imagine that the Delta has in- creafed in length as well as in height; and of this we may look upon the following faft to be a remarkable proof. Under the reign of Pfammiticus, the Mile- fians, with 30 veffels, landed at the mouth of the Bol- bitine branch of the Nile, now called that of Rojetta, where they fortified themfelves.

"travellers, particularly Mr Bruce, who has given a pretty long differtation upon it, as well as many occa- 4 I fional E G Y [ 61 fional remarks through the courfe of his work. He begins with obferving, i. That the country of Egypt is entirely a valley bounded by rugged mountains ; whence it might feem natural to imagine that the Nile, overflowing a country of this kind, would be more ready to wafli away the foil than add to it. 2. It is obferved by Dr Shaw, and the fame is confirmed by our author, that there is a gentle Hope from the mid¬ dle of the valley to the foot of the mountains on each fide ; fo that the middle, in which is the channel of the Nile, is really higher than any other part of the valley. Large trenches are cut acrof- the country from the channel of the river, and at right angles with it, to the foot of the mountains. 3. As the river fwells, the canals become filled with water, which naturally de- fcending to the foot of the mountains, runs out at the farther end, and overflows the adjacent level country",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"4. When the water, having attained the lowed ground, begins to ftagnate, it does not acquire any motion by reafon of the canal’s being at right angles with the channel of the Nile, unlefs in the cafe of exceflive rains in Ethiopia, when the water by its regurgitation again joins the dream. In this cafe, the motion of the cur¬ rent is communicated to the whole mafs of waters, and every thing is fvvept away by them into the fea. 5. It has been the opinion of feveral authors, that there was a neceflity for meafuring the height of the inundation on account of the quantity of mud brought down annually by the waters, by which the landmarks were fo covered, that the proprietors could not know their own grounds after the river fubfided. But whatever might be the reafon of this covering of the landmarks in ancient times, it is certain that the mud left by the Nile could not be fo in the time of Herodotus, or during any period of time afligned by that hiftorian j for he afligns only one foot of increafe of foil throughout Egypt in an hundred years from the mud left by the river •, the in¬ creafe during one year, therefore, being only the hun¬ dredth part of a foot, could not cover any landmark whatever. Befides, the Egyptian lands are at this day parted by huge blocks of granite, which frequently have gigantic heads at the end of them : and thefe could not, at the rate mentioned by Herodotus, be covered in feveral thoufand years. 6. The Nile does not now bring down any great quantity of mud •, and it is abfurd to fuppofe that it can at prefent bring down as much as it did foon after the creation, or the ages imme¬ diately fucceeding the deluge. Throughout Abyflinia, according to the teftimony of our author, the channel of every torrent is now worn to the bare rock, and al- moft every rivulet runs in a hard ftony bed, all the loofe earth being long ago wafhed away ; fo that an annual and equable increafe of the earth from the fediment of the waters is impoffible. 7. Our author made a great number of trials of the water of the Nile during the time of its inundation in different places. At Baf- boch, when juft coming down from the cultivated parts of Abyflinia, and before it enters Sennaar, the fediment is compofed of fat earth and fand, and its quantity is exceedingly fmall. At the jumflion of the Nile and Aflaboras the quantity of fediment is very little augmented ; confiding ftill of the fame materials, but now moftly fand. At Syene the quantity of fedi¬ ment was almoft nine times greater than before ; but was now compofed almoft entirely of fand, with a very 8 ] E G Y fmall quantity of black earth. The conclufion of our author’s experiments, however, is different from what- we fhould have been led to expett from thofe juft men¬ tioned. “ The experiment at Rofetta (fays he) was not fo often repeated as the others : but the refult was, that in the ftrength of the inundation the fediment con¬ fided moftly of fand •, and, towards the end, was much the greater part earth. I think thefe experiments con- clufive, as neither the Nile coming frefh from Abyflinia, nor the Atbara, though joined by the Mareb, likewife from the fame country, brought any great quantity of foil from thence.” 8. Our author goes on to obferve, that had the Nile brought down the.quantities of mud which it has been faid to do, it ought to have been moft charged with it at Syene j as there it contained the whole that was to be conveyed by it into Egypt. Inftead of this, how¬ ever, the principal part of the fediment at this place was fand j and this is very naturally accounted for from the vaft quantities of fand taken up by the winds in the deferts between Gooz and Syene. Here our traveller frequently faw vaft pillars of this kind of fand, which is fo fine and light as to form an impalpable powder, traverfing the defect in various directions. Many of thefe were driven upon the river $ and when it became calm in the evening, fell down into it entirely ; thus affording materials for the many fandy iflands to be met with in the Nile",Atbara,"EG,ET,SD",5,"Egypt,Ethiopia,Sudan","Africa,Africa,Africa"
"9. Mr Bruce adopts the opinion of thofe who fup¬ pofe that there has been a continual decreafe of water fince the creation of the wrorld. In this cafe, therefore, if the land of Egypt had been continually increafing in height while the water that was to cover it decreafed j there muft have been frequent famines on account of the want of a fufficient inundation. But fo far is this from being the cafe, that, according to the teftimony of feveral Arabian MSS. there had not, when Mr Bruce was in Egypt, been one fcarce feafon from the lownefs of the inundation for 34 years 5 though during the fame fpace they had three times experienced a famine by too great an abundance of water, which carried away the millet",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The ftrongeft arguments which the advocates for theopii increafe of land in Egypt can make ufe of is, that venous- the meafures by which the quantity of inundation i**j^jr“ie determined are fmaller now than in former times ; and rife 0f 1 thefe fmall meafures are faid to have been introduced ir by the Saracens. On this Mr Bruce very juftly ob-cientu ferves, that fuch an expedient could not have anfwer- ed any good purpofe •, as no decreafe of the meafure could have augmented the quantity of corn produced by the ground. M. Savary obferves, that, to render his calculation concerning the growth of land in Egypt abfolutely exatft, it would be necefiary to determine - th© Egypt",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"E G Y [ 61 the precife length of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian cubit •, and even to know the different alterations which that meafure had undergone among thofe people: But this nicety he thinks needlefs, looking upon the general fa£t to be fully eftablidied by what he had faid before. Mr Bruce, however, has treated the fubjedt with much greater accuracy. He obferves, that from the fituation of Canopus, the dillance betwixt Egypt and Cyprus, and the extenfion of the land to the north¬ ward, it appears that no addition of any confequence had been made to it for 3000 years part. The only argument left for the increafe of land therefore muft be taken from the nilometer. The ufe of this inftrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that fo it might be known whether the crop would be fufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exadted of them by the fovereign or not. The firft ftep was to know what fpace of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by menfuration, the next thing was to afcertain the produce of the ground upon an average. Thus becoming acquainted with the greateft and leaft crops produced, together with the exadl extent of ground overflowed, they were furnifh- ed with all the neceflary principles for conftru&ing a nilometer ; and nothing now remained but to eredl a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exadfly into cu¬ bits. This was accordingly done ; the pillar was firft divided into cubits, and thefe again were fubdivided into digits. The firft divifion of this kind was un¬ doubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man ; being the length of the arm from the middle of the round bone in the elbow to the point of the middle finger ; a meafure ftill in ufe among all rude nations. As no ftandard could be found by which this meafure might be exa&ly determined, authors have dif¬ fered very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and of an inch ; the other one foot and of a foot ; but Mr Bruce is of opinion' that both of thefe are too large. He found, by menfuration, the Egyptian cubit to be ex¬ actly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch ; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit ufed for determining the increafe of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increafe was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed ; but that in his time 16 or at leaft 15 cubits were neceffary to produce the fame eff-ft:. But to this account Mr Bruce obje&s, that Herodotus could have no certain information con¬ cerning the nilometer, becaufe he himfelf fays that the priefts, who alone had accefs to it, would tell him no¬ thing of the matter. Herodotus alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation ; and this fuperfluous quantity Mr Bruce fuppofes to have been conveyed in¬ to the defert for the ufe of the Arabs, and that by fuch a vaft drain the rile of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminilhed. But even granting that there was fuch a difference between the rife of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Hero¬ dotus, it does not appear that anv thing like it has appeared ever lince. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 9 ] E G Y 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that Egypt; eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in v the time of Moeris. From fome paffages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exer¬ tion of induftry to caufe this quantity of water pro¬ duce a plentiful crop ; but there is not the leaft reaion to fuppofe, that the very fame induftry was not ne¬ ceffary in the time of Moeris ; fo that ftill there is not any increafe of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian vifited Egypt, we are informed from unqueftionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the ftandard; both which accounts correfpond with that of Herodo¬ tus. Laftly, Procopius, who lived in the time of Jul* tinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requifite for a minimum. # # 13a From thefe accounts, fo various and difcordant, it is No increafe obvious that no certain conclufion can be drawn. ^ is not indeed eafy to determine the reafon of this dif- ^eafon- ference in point of fa£l. 1 he only conje&ure we can ^ fup* offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a fmafter pofed; quantity of water will anfwer the purpofe of producing a plentiful crop, fo it is not unreafonable to fuppofe that at different periods the induftry of the people has varied fo much as to occafion the difagreement in que- ftion. This would undoubtedly depend very much upon their governor ; and indeed Strabo informs us that it was by the care of the governor Petronius, that fuch a final 1 quantity of water was made to anfwer the purpofe","Roman, Memphis, Adrian","EG,US,CY,RO,GR",5,"Egypt,United States,Cyprus,Romania,Greece","Africa,North America,Asia,Europe,Europe"
"The conclufion drawn by Mr Bruce from the whole of the accounts above related, is, that from them it is moft probable that no increafe of land has been indicated by the nilometer from the time of Moeris to that of Jufti- nian. _ *35 On the conqueft of Egypt by the Saracens, their1™*111 barbarous and ftupid caliph deftroyed the nilometer,” caufing another to be built in its ftead, and afterwards fixed the ftandard of paying tribute confiderably below what it had ufually been. The Egyptians were thus kept in continual terror, and conftantly watched the new nilometer to obferve the gradual increafe or de- creafe of the water. On this he ordered the new nilo¬ meter to be deftroyed, and another to be conftru&ed, and aft accefs to it to be denied to the people. Which prohibition is ftill continued to Chriftians; though our author found means to get over this obftacle, and has given a figure of the inftrument itfelf. That the people might not, however, be fuppofed to remain in total ig¬ norance of their fituation, he commanded a proclamation to be daily made concerning the height of the water, but in fuch an unintelligble manner that nobody was made any wifer ; nor, according to our author, is the proclamation underftood at this day. From his own ob- fervations, however, Mr Bruce concludes, that 15 cubits are now the minimum of inundation, and as this coin¬ cides with the accounts of it in the times of Herodotus and Adrian, he fuppofes with great probability, that the fame quantity of water has been neceffary to over¬ flow this country from the earlieft accounts to the pre¬ fect time",Adrian,"EG,US",5,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"E G Y [ 620 ] E G Y Egypt. With regard to his other affertions concerning the city '“""—■v—of Metelis having been once a fea port, M. Volney proves M Sava ^aS Strabo unfairly, and consequently no rv’s opinion ftrefs is to be laid uPon ^em. The principal, indeed concerning the only, evidence which therefore remains, is the palfage the ifle ot already quoted from Homer, viz. that “ the illand of Pharos re- Pharos Js as far ditlant from one of the mouths of the Volney 1 * as a ve^el can one ^ay before the wind.” “ But (fays M. Volney) wThen Homer fpeaks of the diftance of this ifland, he does not mean its diflance from the (bore oppofite, as that traveller (M. Savary) has tranflated him, but from the land of Egypt and the river Nile. In the fecond place, by a day’s fail we mull not underftand that indefinite fpace which the veffels, or rather the boats of the ancient Greeks, could pafs through in a day $ but an accurate and determined meafure of 540 ftadia. This meafure is afcertained by Herodotus, and is the precife diftance between Pharos and the Nile, allowing, with M. d’Anville, 27,000 toifes to 540 Itadia. It is therefore far from being proved, that the increafe of the Delta or of the continent was fo rapid as has been reprefented ; and, if we were difpofed to maintain it, we Humid Hill have to explain how this fhore, which has not gained half a league from the days of Alexander, (hould have gained eleven in the far fhorter period from the time of Menelaus to that conqueror. The utmoft extent of the encroachment of this land upon the fea, however, may be learned from the words of Herodotus ; who informs us, that “ the breadth of Egypt, along the fea coall, from the gulf of Plin- thine to the lake Serbonis near Mount Cafius, is 3600 ftadia ; and its length from the fea to Heliopolis 1500 ftadia.” Allowing therefore the ftadium of Herodotus to be between 50 and 51 French toifes, the 1500 ftadia juft mentioned are equal to 76,000 toifes j which, at the rate of 57,000 to a degree, gives one degree and near 20 minutes and a half. But from the aftronomical obferva- tions of M. Niebuhr, who travelled for the king of Den¬ mark in 1761, the difference of latitude between Helio¬ polis, now called Alatarea, and the fea, being one degree 29 minutes at Damietta, and one degree 24 minutes at Rofetta, there is a difference on one fide of three minutes and a half, or a league and a half encroachment; and eight minutes and a half, or three leagues and a half, on the other.” Thus the difpute concerning the augmentation of the land of Egypt by the Nile feems to be abfolutely decid¬ ed } and the encroachments of it on the fea fo trifling, that we may juftly doubt whether they exift, or whether we are not entirely to attribute the apparent differences to thofe which certainly take place betwixt the ancient and modern menfuration. M. Volney gives a very par¬ ticular defcription of the face of the country $ but takes notice of the inconveniences under which travellers la¬ bour in this country, by which it is rendered extremely difficult to fay any thing certain with regard to the na¬ ture of the foil or mineral produflions. Thefe arife from the barbarity and fuperftition ©f the people, who imagine all the Europeans to be magicians and forcerers, who come by their magic art to difcover the treafures which the genii have concealed under the ruins. So deep rooted is this opinion, that no perfon dares walk alone in the fields, nor can he find any one willing to accompany him j by which means he is confined to the banks of the river, and it is only by comparing the ac- 3 counts of various travellers that any ledge can be acquired","Sava, Delta, Damietta","EG,IT,CA,FR",5,"Egypt,Italy,Canada,France","Africa,Europe,North America,Europe"
"and the fame beautiful appearance is continued all the way to Cairo. As we proceed farther up the river, he fays, that nothing can more refemble the appearance of the country than the marfhes of the Lower Loire, or the plains of Flanders : inftead, hovvever, of the numer- ; ous trees and country houfes of the latter, we rouft imagine fome thin woods of palms and fycamores, with a few villages of mud-walled cottages built on artificial mounds. All this part of Egypt is very low and flat, the declivity of the river being fo gentle, that its wa¬ ters do not flow at a greater rate than one league in an hour. Throughout the country nothing is to be feen but palm trees, Angle or in clumps, which become more rare in proportion as you advance j with wretched vil¬ lages compofed of huts with mud Avails, and a bound- lefs plain, which at different feafons is an ocean of frefh water, a miry morafs, a verdant field, or a dully defert y and on every fide an extenfive and foggy horizon, where the eye is wearied and difgufted. At length, towards the junction of the two branches of the river, the moun¬ tains of Cairo are difcovered on the eaft ; and to the fouth-weft three detached maffes appear, which from their triangular form are known to be the pyramids","Cairo, Cairo",EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"From comparing his own obfervations with thofe of other travellers, our author concludes, that the balls of all Egypt from Afouan (the ancient Syene) to the Me-- diterranean, is a continued bed of calcareous ftone of whitifh hue, and fomewhat foft, containing the fame kind of (hells met with in the adjacent feas, and which forms the imrnenfe quarries extending from Saouadi to Manfalout for the fpace of more than 25 leagues, ac¬ cording to the teftimony of Father Sicard. ,36 As this country has been more recently vifited by Reynier’ men of eminent abilities and profound refearch, who appear to have examined every obje£l that prefented itfelf with a philofopher’s eye, we beg leave to add to the teftimonies of the authors already mentioned, the fubftance of the French general Reynier’s account of the face of the country.

"In Upper Egypt, a chain of mountains prefent them- felves to the eye of the traveller on either fide of the Nile. The valley between thefe mountains, through which the courfe of the river is direct'd, is nearly five leagues broad, which the periodical inundations of the river completely cover. T his valley alone is inhabit¬ ed, and fufceptible of cultivation. The eaftern chain of mountains, by which the Nile is feparated from the Red fea, furpafles that on the weft in refpeft of height, terminating by precipices towards the valley, affuming in different places the appearance of an immenfe wall, broken irregularly by narrow valleys, which have owed their origin to the fudden and temporary torrents of winter, and ferve for pafles over thefe ftupendous mountains. The weftern chain, by which the valley of the Nile is feparated from that of Ouafis, has in general a gradual and gentle declivity,, although it becomes more abrupt towards Siout, and is fteep from the angle formed by the Nile towards Hennh, till it reaches3Syene, at which place the mountains have a more confiderable height, affording but a narrow paf- fage to the river",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The diftance between thefe two chains of mountains is increafed as you approach Cairo, the eaftern chain terminating near the extremity of the Red fea, without the appearance of any junction with the Arabian moun¬ tains, which have a fimilar termination. The weftern chain declines towards Fayoum, taking a north-weft dire&ion near Grand Cairo, and forming the Mediter¬ ranean eoaft in a direction to the weft. Lower Egypt lies between thefe two great chains of mountains and the fea, which has moft probably been formed, at lealt in a great meafure, by the flime or mud which the ri¬ ver Nile depofits, as it is interfered by its branches, and a vaft number of canals",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The feven branches by which the Nile anciently emptied itfelf into the Mediterranean, are at prefent ic- duced to two, viz. thofe of Damietta and Rofetta",Damietta,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The cutting of canals to effer the equilibrium of the water, the channels of which were afterwards neglected, would diminifti the quantum of water in one branch and increafe it in another. The fait water mingling with the frefh, would deftroy the fecundity of the Egypt, ground in fome places, and thus induce the inhabitants "" » 1 to fearch for habitations where they might find the earth more fertile",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"It has already been obferved, that the principal part of Lower Egypt owes its exiftence to the depofition of mud or earth by the Nile, which alfo formed the banks at the different mouth of that river. The mud of the Nile would firft cover the low ground neareft to its bed or channel, and the increafe of land from the de¬ pofition of mud would be more gradual in its progrels in diftant parts, from which circumftance would arife the formation of lake*. Thefe in their turn would be gradually filled up by the land growing out of the de- pofited mud of the river, which of confequence would increafe the boundaries of Lower Egypt, by taking from the fea j but as it is natural for the fea to refill fuch encroachments, it is probable that the ground formed by the depofited mud of the Nile will no longer continue to increafe in one direflion without diminilh- ing in another. The experience of centuries paft has fully evinced, that the fea has aiftually taken more from the extent of Egypt than has been compenfated by the mud of the Nile. By the Ample operation of natural caufes it may be fafely concluded, that if nature and art do not co-operate •, if the water is permitted to increafe, and the channels of the different branches are allowed to be augmented, the fea will continue to fnatch new lands from the inhabitants, which appears to be the inevitable doom of Egypt, while it continues in the hands of a people who are ignorant and unculti¬ vated",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"In addition to the branches and chief canals already mentioned, there are numerous canals in Lower Egypt by which it is interfered. Thefe convey the waters of the inundation, which dykes in different diftrifls ferve to retain. By thefe waters the more elevated grounds are fertilized, and other cantons in fucceflion, after which they are poured into the lakes, or are loft in the fea. The fwelling of this remarkable river com¬ mences about the fummer folftice, reaching its utmoft extent in the autumnal equinox $ and after appearing for a few days in all its native majefty, it gradually begins - Egypt",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Nor would an army deftined to defend Egypt find it- felf free from very confiderable embarraffment during the continuance of the inundation j for as a confider¬ able part of its movements would unavoidably be made on that element, they would be from the nature of things both tedious and difficult",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa

"The only metal faid by the ancients to be produced {n Egypt is copper. On the road to Suez are found great numbers of thofe ftones called Egyptian flints and pebbles, though the bottom is a hard, calcareous, and fonorous ftone. Here alfo M. Volney tells us, that the ftones above mentioned, and which refemble petri¬ fied wood, are to be met with. Thefe, he fays, are in the form of fmall logs cut flanting at the ends, and might eafily be taken for petrifadhons, though he is convinced that they are real minerals",Suez,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"F. Sicard mentions two lakes, from the water of which is produced annually a great quantity of fait containing much mineral alkali : and M. Volney in¬ forms us, that the whole foil of this country is impreg¬ nated with fait; fo that, upon digging to fome depth in the ground we always meet with brackilh water im¬ pregnated in fome degree with the mineral alkali as well as with common fait. The two lakes mentioned by Sicard are fituated in the defert to the weft of the Delta •, and are three or four leagues in length, and about a quarter of a league in breadth, with a (olid and ftony bottom. For nine months in the year they are without water ; but in the winter time there oozes out of the earth a reddith violet coloured water, which fills the lakes to the height of five or fix feet. This being evaporated by the return of the heat, there remains a bed of fait two feet thick and very hard, which is bro¬ ken in pieces with iron bars ; and no lefs than 30,000 quintals are procured every year from thefe lakes. So great is the propenfity of the Egyptian foil to produce fait, that even when the gardens are overflowed for the fake of watering them, the furface of the ground, af¬ ter the evaporation and abforption of the water, ap¬ pears glazed over with fait. I he water found in the wells contains mineral alkali, marine fait, and a little nitre. M. Volney is of opinion, that the fertile mould of Egvpt, which is of a blackifh colour, differs effen- tially from that of the other parts } and is derived frorn the internal parts of Ethiopia along with the waters of the Nile. This feema to contradift what he had before advanced againft M. Savary concerning the increafe of the land of Egypt by means of the w’aters of this river: but there is no reafon at all to fuppofe this kind of earth to be of a foreign origin •, it being always the refult of vegetation and cultivation. Even the moft barren and fandy fpots in the world, if properly water- ] E G Y ed, and fuch vegetables planted in them as would grow Egypt, there, in time would be covered with this black earth ' 'f~mm as well as others : and of this kind of artificial formation of foil, travellers give us a remarkable initance in the garden of the monks at Mount Sinai, where the country is naturally as barren as in any place of the world",Delta,"EG,ET,CA",5,"Egypt,Ethiopia,Canada","Africa,Africa,North America"
"“ The monks of Sinai (fays Dr Shaw), in a long procefs of time, have covered over with dung and the {’weepings of their convent near four acres of naked rocks : which produce as good cabbage, roots, lalad, and all kinds of pot-herbs, as any foil and climate whatfoever. They have likevvife raifed olive, plum, almond, apple, and pear trees, not only in great num¬ bers, but of excellent kinds. The pears particularly are in fuch efteem at Cairo, that there is is a prefent of them fent every year to the baftiaw and perfons of the firft quality. Neither are their grapes inferior in fize and flavour to any whatfoever : it being fully demon- ftrated, by what this little garden produces, how far an indefatigable induftry can prevail over nature •, and that feveral places are capable of culture and improve¬ ment which were intended by nature to be barren, and which the lazy and llothful have always fuffered to be fo.” 143 From this general account of the country, we may Natural reafonably conclude, that the natural fertility of Egypt fertility of • 1 1 .1 r _ EcrvDt not is not diminilhed in modern times, provided the ^ame dimmiftied, pains were taken in the cultivation of it as formerly j but this is not to be expefted from the prefent degene¬ rate race of inhabitants. “ The Delta (fays M. Savary) is at prefent in the moft favourable ftate for agriculture",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Waihed on the cart and weft by two rivers formed by the divifion of the Nile, each of which is as large and more deep than the Loire, interfered by innumerable rivulet* •, it prefents to the eye an immenfe garden, all the different compartments of which may be eafily watered. During the three months that the Thebais is under water, the Delta poffeffes fields covered with rice, barley, vegetables, and winter fruits. It is alio the only part of Egypt where the fame field produces two crops of grain within the year, the one of rice, the other of barley.” The only caufe of all this fertility is the Nile, with¬ out which the whole country would foon become an un¬ inhabitable defert, as rain falls very feldom in this part of the world. It flows with a very gentle ftream through the flat country, and its waters are very muddy, fo that they mult have time to fettle, or even require filtration ^ before they can be drunk. For purifying the water, tviett70a 0f the Egyptians, according to M. Volney, ufe bitter purifying almonds, with which they rub the veffel containing it, cooling and then the water becomes light and good •, but on what principle this ingredient aits we cannot pretend to determine. Unglazed earthen veffels filled with wa¬ ter are kept in every apartment *, which by a continual evaporation through their porous fubflance, render the contained fluid very cool even in the greateft heats",Delta,"EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"

About this time it has ufually rifen five or fix cubits; and when it has rifen to 16, great rejoicings are made, and the people cry out Woffah Allah, that is, that God has given them abundance. This commonly takes place about the latter end of July, or at fartheft before the 20th of Augult ; and the fooner it takes place, fo much the greater are the hopes of a good crop. Sometimes, though rarely, the neceffary increafe does not take place till later. In the year 1705, it did not fwell to 16 cubits till the 19th of September ; the confequence of which was that the country was de¬ populated by famine and pefiilence",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Mr Bruce informs us, that this is placed between Geeza and Cairo, on the point of an ifland named Rhoda about the middle of the river, but fomewhat nearer to Geeza. It is a round tower with an apartment, in the middle of which is a ciftern neatly lined with mar¬ ble. The bottom of this ciftern reaches to that of the river, and there is a large opening by which the water has free accefs to the infide. The rife of the water is indicated by an o£Iagonal column of blue and white marble, on which are marked 20 peeks or cubits of 22 inches each. The two lowermoft of thefe have no fub- divifions ; but each of the reft is divided into 24 parts r called digits ; the whole height of the pillar being 36-y!, feet 8 inches",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"As the Nile does not always rife to a height fuffi- cient for the purpofes of agriculture, the former fove- reigns of Egypt were at vaft pains to cut proper ca¬ nals in order to fupply the deficiency. Some of thefe are ftill preferved, but great numbers are rendered ufe- lefs through the indolence or barbarity of their fuccef- fors. Thofe which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are bell taken care of by government. The laft is watched by an officer appointed for that purpofe, whofe office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bachria, who receive this fuper- fluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increafe of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by thofe who derive advantage fiom them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the pro¬ vince of Sharkia ; which, making part of the ifthmus of Suez, is the molt confiderable of Egypt, and the moft capable of a great increafe of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are pofieffed by the Arabs, would be no lefs fertile, were it not for the exceffive inclination thefe people have to deftroy, fo that they make war even with the fpontaneous prodtnftions oftheeaith. A number of other canals run through the Delta ; and the veftiges of thofe which watered the provinces to the eaftward and weft ward, (how that in former times thefe were the beft cultivated parts of Egypt. “ We may alfo prefume (fays the baron de Tott), from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the conftru&ion of the canal, and the natural level of the lands which encompafs the lake Mareotis, and extend themfelves weft ward to the kingdom of Barca, that this country, at prefent given up to the Arabs, and almoft defert, was once fufficiently rich in productions of every kind to furnifh the city of Alexander with its whole fubfiftence.” I The air and climate of Egypt are extremely hot,AjrXa^ not only from the height of the fun, which in fummerclimate approaches to the zenith, but from the w'ant of rain and Egypt* from the vicinity of thofe burning and fandy deferts which lie to the fouthward. In the months of July and Auguft, according to M. Volney, Reaumur’s thermo¬ meter (lands, even in the moft temperate apartments, at the height of 24 or 25 degrees above the freezing point ; and in the fouthern parts it is faid to rife ftill higher. Hence, he fays, only two feafons (hould be diftinguiftied in Egypt, the cool and the hot, or fpring and fummer. The latter continues for the greateft part of E G Y oF the year, viz. from March to November or even ■Monger : for by the end of February the fun is intoler¬ able to a European at nine o’clock in the morning","Cairo, Alexandria, Alexandria, Cairo, Damietta, Suez, Gaza, Delta, Alexandria, March","EG,US,PS,CA,GB",5,"Egypt,United States,Palestine, State of,Canada,United Kingdom","Africa,North America,Asia,North America,Europe"
"It might naturally be imagined, that as for three months in the year Egypt is in a wet and mardiy fituation, the excedive evaporation and putrefaction of the dagnating waters would render it Very unhealthy",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"But this is by no means the cafe. The great drynefs of the air makes itabforh vapours of all kinds with the utmod avidity j and thefe rifing to a great height, are carried off by the winds either to the fouthward or northward, without having time to communicate anv of their pernicious effe&s. This drynefs is fo remark¬ able in the internal parts of the country, that defn meat expofed to the open air does not putrefy even in fum¬ mer, but foot) becomes hard and dry like wood. In the deferts there are frequently dead carcafes thus dried in filch a manner, and become fo light, that one may ea- fny lift that of a camel with one hand. In the mari¬ time parts, however, this dryntfs of the air is not to be expeCIed. They difcover the fame degree of moidure which ufually attends fuch fituations. At Rofetta and Alexandria, iron cannot be expofed to the air for 24 hours without ruding. According to M. Volnev, the air of Egypt is alfo flrongly impregnated with falts: for which opinion he gives the following reafon : “ The dones are corroded by natrum (mineral alkali or foda), and in moid places long crydallifcations of it are to be found, which might be taken for faltpetre. The wall of the lefuits garden at Cairo, built with earth and bricks, is everywhere covered with a erud of this natrum as thick as a crown piece : and when this garden has been overflowed by the waters of the kalidj (canal), the ground, after they have drained off, appears fparkling on every fide with crydals, which certainly wete not brought thither by the water, as it diows no fign of fait either to the tade or by didillation.”—But what¬ ever may be the quantity of fait contained in the earth, it is certain that M. Volney’s opinion of its coming thi¬ ther from the air cannot be jud. The fait in quedion is excedively fixed, and cannot be didipated into the air without the violent heat of a glafshoufe furnace •, and even after this has been done, it will not remain diffuf- ed through the atmofphere, but quickly falls back again","Alexandria, Cairo","EG,US",5,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"f 625 1 E G Y breathed it.

"By reafon of the great drynefs of the air, Egypt is exempted from the phenomena of rain, hail, fnow, thunder, and lightning. Earthquakes are alfo feldom heard of in this country; though fometimes they have been very fatal and deltruflive, particularly one in the year 1112. In the Delta it never rains in fummer, and very feldom at any other time. In 1761, however, fuch a quantity of rain unexpe&edly fell, that a great number of houfes, built with mud walls, tumbled entire¬ ly down by being foaked with the water, to which they were unaccudomed. In the Higher Egypt the rain is dill led frequent ; but the people, fenfible of the advantages which accrue from it, always rejoice when any falls, however infufficient to anfwer the pur- 14a pofe.

In Egypt they are denominated “ winds of 50 days,” becaufe they moft commonly prevail during the 50 days preced¬ ing and following the equinox; though, fhould they blow conftantly during one half of that time, an uni- verfal deftrudtion would be the confequence. Of thefe travellers have given various deferiptions. M. Volney fays, that the violence of their heat may be compared to that of a large oven at the moment of drawing out the bread. They always blow from the fouth ; and are undoubtedly owing to the motion of the atmofphere over fuch vaft trails of hot fand, where it cannot be fupplied by a fufficient quantity of moiflure. When they begin to blow, the Iky lofes its ufual ferenity, and aflumes a dark, heavy, and alarming afpeft, the fun himfelf laying afide his ufual fplendour, and becoming of a violet colour. This terrific appearance feems not to be occafioned by any real haze or cloud in the atmo¬ fphere at that time, but folely to the vaft quantity of fine fand carried along by thofe winds, and which is fo exceflively fubtile that it penetrates everywhere. The motion of this wind is always rapid, but its heat is not intolerable till after it has continued for fome time. Its pernicious qualities are evidently occafioned by its ex- ceflive avidity of moifture. Thus it dries and flirivels up the fkin ; and by doing the fame to the lungs, will in a ftiort time produce fuffocation and death.

Df the in- The inhabitants of Egypt may now be diflinguifhed nahitants of jnto four gifliniT races of people,,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Sgypt* I. Xhe Arabs, who may be fubdivided into three claffes. 1. The poiierity of thofe who fettled here immediately after the conqueft of the country by Amrou Ebn A1 As, the caliph Omar’s general. 2. The Magrebians, or Weflern Arabs, who at different times have migrated from the countries to the wellward of Egypt, and are defcended from the Saracen con¬ querors of Mauritania. 3. The Bedouins, or Arabs of the defert, known to the ancients by the name of Scenites, or dwellers in tents. I he firfl of thefe claffes are now found among the hufbandmen and artizans 5 and are diflinguifhed from the others by being of a more rebuff habit of body, as well as of a larger 11a- ture than the others. They are in general five feet four inches high j and many of them attain two or three inches more, and are mufcular without being tlelhy",,"EG,MR",5,"Egypt,Mauritania","Africa,Africa"
"Like the former, they apply themfeives to agriculture and mechanical occupations. The Bedouins pafs their lives among the rocks, ruins, and fequeftrated places where they can find water ; fometimes uniting in tribes and living in low fmoky tents, and Hutting their ha¬ bitations from the defert to the banks of the river and back again, as bell fuits their conveniency. Their time of inhabiting the defert is the fnring ; but after the inundation they take up their refidence in Egypt, in or¬ der to profit by the fertility of the country. Some farm lands in the country, which they cultivate, but change annually. In general, all thefe Bedouins are robbers, and are a great terror to travellers as well as to the hul- bandmen j but though their number is eftimated at not lefs than 30,000, they are difperfed in fuch a manner that they cannot attempt any thing of confe- ’quence",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"II. The Copts are defeendants of thofe inhabitants of Egypt whom the Arabs fubdued, and who were com- pofed of original Egyptians, Periians and Greeks. M",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Volney is of opinion that their name of Copts is only an abbreviation of the Greek word Aigouptios, an Egyptian. They are principally to be met with in the Said, though fome alfo inhabit the Delta. 1 hey have all a yellowilh dufky complexion, puffed up vifage, fwoln eyes, flat nofes, and thick lips j and in fail the exadt countenance ot a mulatto. M. Volney, from a view of the fphynx, and finding its features to be fuch as is juft now deferibed, concludes, that the ancient E- gyptians were real negroes j which he thinks is likewife confirmed by a paffage in Herodotus, where he con¬ cludes, that the inhabitants of Colchis were defcended from the Egyptians, “ on account of the blacknefs of their fkins and frizzled hair.” M. Volney alfo re¬ marks, that the countenance of the negroes is fuch as exadtly reprefents that ftate of contraction aflumed by our faces when ftrongly affefted by heat. The eye-brows are knit, the cheeks rile, the eye lids are contracted, and the mouth diftorted; and this ftate of contraction to which the features of the negroes are perpetually expofed in the hot climates they in¬ habit, is become particularly charaCteriftic. Excef- five cold and fnow produces the lame effcCt 5 and hence this kind of countenance is alfo common among the Tartars j while, in the temperate climates, the features are proportionably lengthened, and the whole counte¬ nance expanded",Delta,"CA,GR,EG",5,"Canada,Greece,Egypt","North America,Europe,Africa"
"The Copts profefs the Chriftian religion, but follow the herefy of the Eutychians, whence they have been perfecuted by the Greeks ; but having at laft got the better of their adverfaries, they are become the depofi- taries of the regifters of the lands and tribes. At Cairo they are called writers; and are the intendants, fecre- taries, and collectors for government. The head of their clafs is writer to the principal chief; but they are all hated by the Turks, to whom they are Haves, as well as by the peafants whom they opprefs. Iheir language bears a great refemblance to the Greek •, but they have five letters in their alphabet, as well as a number of words in their language, which may be con- fidertd as the remains of the ancient Egyptian. Thefe are found to bear a near refemblance to the dialeCts of fome of the neighbouring nations, as the Arabic, Ethio¬ pian, Syriac, &c. and even of thofe who lived on the banks of the Euphrates. The language of the Copt', however, lias fallen into difufe for upwards of 300 years",,"GR,EG",5,"Greece,Egypt","Europe,Africa"
"On the conqueft of the country by the Saracens, the latter obliged the people to learn their language ; and about the year 722 the ufe of the Greek tongue was prohibited throughout the whole of their empire : the Arabic language then of courfe became univerfal ; while the others, being only met with in books, foon became totally negleCted. The true Coptic, therefore, though there is a tranflation of the fcriplures and many books of devotion written in it, is underftoqd by nobody, not even the monks and priefts. < III. The Turks, who have the title of being mailers of Egypt, but are chiefly to be met with at Cairo, where they poffefs the religious and military employments",Cairo,"EG,GR",5,"Egypt,Greece","Africa,Europe"
"T’hefe people, as has already been mentioned, are the real matters of Egypt $ and in order to fecure them- felves in the poffeffion of the country, they have taken feveral precautions. One of the principal of thefe is the degradation of the two military corps of azabs and janizaries, both of which were formerly very for¬ midable. J hey have been able to effect this only in confequence of the corrupt and wretched government of the I urks; for before the revolt of Ibrahim Kiaya, the J urkidr troops, which ought to have con fitted of 40,000, were reduced to lefs than half that num¬ ber through the avarice and malverfation of their officers. Their degradation was completed by Ali Bey j who having firlt difplaced all the officers who gave him any umbrage, left their places vacant, and fo reduced the confequence of the whole, that the azabs and ja¬ nizaries are now only a rabble of vagabonds, who dread the Mam looks as much as the meanett of the populace",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The principal body of the Mamlouks refide at Cairo j but many of them are difperfed through the country, in order to keep up their authority, coileft the tribute, and opprefs the people : yet it ffiould feem very eafy for'the Porte to difpoflefs them of this ufurped autho¬ rity, as their number is fuppofed not to exceed 8 500, in¬ cluding among thefe a great many youth under 20 years of age",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The Mamlouks are all horfemen •, and as war is ac¬ counted the only honourable employment among them, it is reckoned difgraceful to walk on foot, none but cavalry being accounted foldiers. The other inha¬ bitants are allowed only the ufe of mules and alfes ; and the fame mark of indignity is impofed upon Eu¬ ropeans •, though by proper management and liberal prefents, this may be got over. In the year 1776 Lord Algernoun Percy, afterwards Lord Louvaine, and the earl of Charlemount, obtained permiffion to ride up¬ on horfeback. The Mamlouks, however, are not incited to this continual - appearance on horfeback merely by their fuppofed fuperiority to the reft of the inhabitants; it is rendered neceflary by their drefs, which is extreme- ly unwieldy and cumberfome. It confifts of a wide Ihirt of thin yellowith-coloured cotton ; over which is a gown of Indian linen, or fome of the light fluffs of Damafcus or Aleppo. Over this is a fecund covering of the fame form and widenefs, with fleeves reaching down to the ends of the fingers. The former covering is called antari, and the latter caftan. The caftan is ufually made of filk or fome finer fluff than the un¬ der garments ; and both of them are fattened by a long belt, which divides the whole drefs into two bundles. Over all thefe they have a third, named djon- /ia, confiding of cloth without lining, and made nearly fimilar to the others, but that the fleeves are cut in the elbow. This coat is lined, fometimes even in fummer, with fur ; and as if all this was not fufll- cient, they have an outer covering called the beniche, which is the cloak or robe of ceremony ; and fo com¬ pletely covers the body, that even the ends of the fingers are not to be feen. Thus, when the beniche and other accoutrements are on, the whole body appears like a long fack, with a bare neck and bald head covered «ith a turban thruft out of it. This turban is called v""- a kaouk; and is of a cylindrical form, yellow, and turned up on the outfide with a roll of muflin artifici¬ ally folded up. On their feet they have a fuck of yel¬ low leather reaching up to the heeb, flippers without any quarters, which confequently are always ready to be left oehind in walking. Laftly, to complete this extra¬ ordinary drefs, they have a kind of pantaloon or trore¬ fers, long enough to reach up to the chin, and fo large that each of the legs is big enough to contain the,whole body •, but that they may walk more at their eafe un¬ der fuch a number of impediments, they tie all the loofe parts of their drefs with a running fafti. “ Thus Twaddled (fays M. Volney), we may imagine the Mam¬ louks are not very a6tive walkers ; and thofe who are not acquainted by experience with the prejudices of dif¬ ferent countries, will find it fcarcely poffible to believe that they look on this drefs as exceedingly commodi¬ ous. In vain we may objeft that it hinders them from walking and encumbers them unneceffarily on horfe¬ back ; and that in battle a horfeman once difmounted is a lort man. They reply, It is the cujlom, and. every objection is anfwered.” In the accoutrements of their horfes, the Mamlouks are almoft equally abfurd. The faddle is a clumfy piece of furniture, weighing with the faddle-cloths not lefs than 25 pounds ; while the weight of the ftirrups is never lefs than 9 or 10 pounds, nay, frequently ex¬ ceeds 13. On the back part of the iaddle rifes a truf- fequin about eight inches in height, while a pummel before proje&s four or five inches, in fuch a manner as to endanger the breaft of the horfeman if he fhould happen to ftoop. Inftead of a ftufted frame, they have three thick woollen coverings below the faddle ; the whole being faftened by a furcingle, which, inftead of a buckle, is tied with leather thongs in very compli¬ cated knots, and liable to flip. Inftead of a crupper they have a large martingale which throws them upon the horfes ffioulders. The ftirrups are made of copper, longer and wider than the foot, having circular edges an inch high in the middle, and gradually declining to¬ ward each end. The edges are (harp, and ufed inftead of fpurs, by which means the poor animal’s fides are much wounded. 1 he weight of the furniture has al¬ ready been mentioned ; and is the more ridiculous as the Egyptian horfes are very fmall. The bridle is equally ill contrived, and greatly injures tie horfe’s mouth, efpecially by reafon cf the violent method they have of managing the animal. Their ufual way is to put the horfe to a full gallop, and fuddenly flop him when at full fpeed. Thus checked by the bit, he bends in his hind legs, ttiffens the fore ones, and moves along as if he fcarce had joints in his body: yet, notwithftand- ing all thofe difadvantages, our author acknowledges that they are vigorous horfemen, having a martial ap¬ pearance which pleafes even ftrangers",Aleppo,"SY,IN,EG",5,"Syrian Arab Republic,India,Egypt","Asia,Asia,Africa"
"hilt to the point, but 30 at leaft in the curve. The reafon of the preterenee given to the crooked blade is, that the effect of a llraight one depends merely on the force with which it tails, and is confined to a {'mall fpace, but that of a crooked one is continued longer by the aftion of the arm in retiring. The Mamlouks commonly procure their labres trom Conftantinople, or other parts of Europe*, but the beys rival each other in thofe of Perfia, and fuch as are fabricated of the an¬ cient It tel of Damafcus. For thefe they frequently pay as high as 40I. or 50I. iterling *, but though it mult be allowed that the edge of thefe weapons is exquifiiely keen, yet they have the defeat of being almoft as brittle as glafs. The whole education and employment of the Mamlouks confilts in the exercife of thefe weapons, or what is conducive to it *, fo that we {hould imagine they might at lalt become altoge¬ ther irrefiitible. Every morning the greater part of them exercife themfelves in a plain near Cairo, by firing their carbines and piftols in the moil expeditious man¬ ner, having an earthen velfel for a mark to (hoot at *, and the perfon who breaks it is highly applauded by the beys who attend in order to encourage them. Here alfo they exercife themfelves in the ufe of the fabre, as well as of the bow and arrows *, though they do not any longer make ufe of thefe laft in their engagements",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"In their engagements they have neither order, difci- pline, nor even fubordination ; fo that their wars are only fcenes of robbery, plunder, add. tumultuary en¬ counters, which begin very often fuddenly in the fireets of Cairo without the leaft warning. If the contention happens to be transferred to the country, it is ftill car¬ ried on in the fame manner. The ftrongeft or moft daring party purfues the other. If they are equal in courage, they will perhaps appoint a field of battle, and that without the leaft regard to the advantages of fituation, but fighting in platoons, with the boldeit champions at the head of each. After mutual defian¬ ces, the attack begins, and every one ehoofes out his man. After difcharging their fire-arms, if they have an opportunity they attack with their fabres *, and fuch as happen to be difmounted are helped up again by their fervants *, but if nobody happens to be near, the fervants will frequently kill them for the fake of the money they carry about them.

Hence they generally leave them to carry on the diJpute by themfelves ; and being always fare of finding a mafter who will employ them, they generally return quietly to Cairo until lome new revolution takes place. . .157 The mode of living among the Mamlouks is exceed-Their ex- ingly expenfive, as may eafily be conceived from whatp^five 'va7 has already been related.

I he chiefs are diftinguilhed from the vulgar by the trinkets and pre¬ cious ftones they wear; by riding Arabian horfes of 200I. or 300I. value, wearing (bawls of Caftmiire in value from 25I. to 50I. each, with a variety of pelifles, the cheapeft ot which cofts above 20I.

Inftead of thefe, diamonds, emerald*, and rubies, are now fubftiluted ; and to the(e they add French ftuff* and laces. In other refpedls the chara61er of the Mamlouks is almoft the word that can be imagined. Without affection, tie, or Their bad connexion with each other or with the reft of man-character, kind, they give themfelves up without controul to the moft enormous vices ; and, according to M. Volriey, they are at once ferocious, perfidious, feditious, bale, deceitful, and corrupted by every fpecies of debauch¬ ery, not excepting even the unnatural vice ; of which he tells us not one is free, this being the very firft leffon each of them receives from his mafter, all being originally (laves, as has already been mentioned. ^ As thefe are the preferat governors of Egypt, we Miferable may eafily judge that the condition of the common ftate of the people cannot be very agreeable. The greater part^gJP1^115* of the lands indeed are in the hands of the Mamlouks, beys, and profeflbrs of the law, the property of all others being verv precarious. Contributions are to be paid, or damages repaired, every moment; and there is neither right of fucceflion nor inheritance for real property, but every thing muft be purchafed from go¬ vernment.

"The only food allowed them is dora or Indian millet, from which they make a kind of taftelefc bread ; and of this, with water and raw onions, confifts all their fare throughout the year. They efteem themfelves happy, therefore, if along with thefe they can fometimes procure a little honey, cheefe, four milk, or a few dates.

"Though the climate of Egypt is far from being un¬ healthy ; yet there arc not a few difeafes which feem to be peculiar to it, and to have their origin either from the conflitution of the atmofphere, or the manner of living of the inhabitants. One of thefe till lately has been fuppofed to be the plague j which opinion we find fupported by Dr Mead, who has endeavoured to affign a natural reafon why it fliould take its origin in this country. But it is now univerfally agreed, that the plague never originates in the interior parts of Egypt, but always begins at Alexandria, paffing fuc- ceffively from thence to Rofetta, Cairo, Damietta, and the reft of the Delta. It is likewife obferved, that its appearance is always preceded by the arrival of fome veffel from Smyrna or Conftantinople j and that if the plague has been very violent in either of thefe cities, the danger of Egypt is the greater. On proper in¬ quiry, it is found to be really a native of Conftantinople j from whence it is exported by the abfurd negligence of the Turks, who refufe to take any care to prevent the fpreading of the infeflion. As they fell even the clothes of the dead without the lealt ceremony, and fhips laden with this pernicious commodity are fent to Alexandria, it is no wonder that it ffiould foon make its appearance there. As foon as it has reached Cairo, the European merchants ffiut themfelves up with their families in their Mans or lodgings taking care to have no further communication with the city. Their pro- vifions are now depofited at the gate of the khan, and are taken up by the porter with iron tongs ; who plunges them into a barrel of water provided for the purpofe. If they have occafion to fpeak to any per- fon, they take care to keep at fuch a diftance as to avoid touching or even breathing upon each other","Alexandria, Cairo, Damietta, Delta, Smyrna, Alexandria, Cairo","EG,US,CA",5,"Egypt,United States,Canada","Africa,North America,North America"
"30 ] 'EG t By thefe precautions they certainly efcape the general calamity, except by accident j and it not long ago happened that the difeafe was conveyed by a cat into the dwellings of the French merchants in Cairo 5 by which two were infe&ed, and one died. In this man¬ ner they are imprifoned for three or four months, without any other amufement than walking on their terraces in the evenings, cards, or converfation with one another. There is a remarkable difference betwixt the plague at Confxantinople and in Egypt. In the former it is moil; violent in fummer; and in' the latter in winter, ending there always in the month of June",Cairo,"EG,FR",5,"Egypt,France","Africa,Europe"
"It is alio remarkable, that the. water-carriers of Egypt, whofe backs are conftantly wet from the nature of their occupation, never have the plague. It ap¬ pears in Egypt every fourth or fiith year, when it makes fuch ravages as would depopulate the country, were it not for the vaft concourfe of llrangers which arrive here every year from all parts of the Turkiffi empire",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"A malady which feems in reality to be peculiar to Egypt is blindnefs. This is fo common at Cairo, as M. Volney informs us, that out of 10O people whom he has met on the flreet, he might reckon 20 quite blind j 10 without the fight of one eye j and 20 others with their eyes red, purulent, or blemifhed",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The venereal difeafe, which, for reafons belt known to themfelves,. the inhabitants call the bleffed evil, is fo general at Cairo, that one half of the inhabitants are infc&ed. It is extremely difficult to cure, though the fymptoms are comparatively very mild, infomuch that people who are infeided witlv it will frequently live to the age of 80 ; but it is fatal to children born with the infection, and exceedingly dangerous to fuch as emi¬ grate to a colder climate",Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Befides thefe, there are two uncommon difeafes met with in Egypt, viz. a cutaneous eruption which returns annually ; and a fwelling of the tefticles, which often degenerates into an enormous hydrocele. The former comes on towards the end of June or beginning of July, making its appearance in red fpots and pimples all over the body, occafioning a very troublefome itching. The caufe of this diilemper, in M. Volney’s opinion, is the corruption of the waters of the Nile, which towards the end of April become very putrid, as has already been obferved. After this has been drunk for fome time, the waters of the inundation, which are freffi and wholeforae, tend to introduce fome change in the blood and humours; when a cutaneous eruption is the natural eonfequence",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"The hydrocele mofl commonly attacks the Greeks and Copts ; and is attributed to the quantity of oil thev make ufe of, as well as to their frequent hot- bathing. Our author remarks, that “ in Syria as well as in Egypt, conftant experience has ffiown, that brandy diftilled from common figs, or from the fruit of the fycamore tree, as well as from dates and the fruit of * the nopal, has a moft immediate effeft on the tefticles, which it renders hard and painful the third or fourth day after it has been drunk ; and if the ufe of it be not difeontinued, the diforder degene¬ rates into a confirmed hydrocele. Brandy diftilled from dried raifins has not the fame effeft : this is al- wavs mixed with anifeeds ; and is very ftrong, being diftilled three times. The Chriftians of Syria and the Copts of Egypt make great ufe of it ; the latter efpecially drink whole bottles of it at their (upper. I imagined this an exaggeration ; but I have myfelf had ocular proofs of its truth, though nothing could equal Jfly aftonifliment that fuch exceffes do not produce in- 1 ] E G Y ftant death, or at leaf! every fymptom of the moft; in- Egypt, fenfibie drunkennefs.” ——",,"EG,SY",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic","Africa,Asia"
"In the fpring feafon malignant fevers prevail in this country ; concerning which our author mentions no re¬ markable particular, but that eggs are a kind of poi- fon, and that bleeding is very prejudicial.

This flourifhing ftate of commerce in ^,^iaer“ the midft of the mofl; defperate barbarity and defpotifm is owing to three caufes. 1. That all the commodities confumed in Egypt are colledled within the walls of that city. 2. That the Mamlouks and all the people of property refide in that place, and there fpend their whole revenues. 3. By the fituation of this city it is a centre of circulation ; correfponding with Arabia and India, by the Red lea ; with Abyffinia and the in¬ terior parts of Africa, by the Nile ; and with Europe anfl the Turkiffi empire, by means of the Mediterra¬ nean. A caravan comes here annually from Abyffinia, bringing from 1000 to 1200 (laves, with gum, ivory, gold dull, oftrich-feathers, parrots, and monkeys.— Another, which fets out from the extreme parts of Mo¬ rocco, takes in pilgrims for Mecca from all that country as far fouth as the mouth of the river Senegal","Cairo, Mecca","EG,IN,SN,SA",5,"Egypt,India,Senegal,Saudi Arabia","Africa,Asia,Africa,Asia"

Proceeding thence to Cairo, it joins the Egyptian caravan ; and then felling out both toge¬ ther, they take their journey toMecca, from whence they return in one hundred days ; but the Morocco pilgrims, who have ftill 600 leagues to go, are upwards of a year in returning.

During the proper feafon there are alfo a number of veffels in the road of Damietta, unloading hogfheads of tobacco from Latakia, vaft quantities of which are confumed in this country. For this commodity rice is taken in, exchange ; while other veffels bring clothing, arms, furs, paffengers, and wrought filk from Conflantinople","Cairo, Suez, Damietta, Latakia","EG,SY",5,"Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic","Africa,Asia"
From fo many fources we need not wonder that the commerce of Cairo fhould be in a very flourifhing date,Cairo,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"In 1783, according to the report of the commiffioner- general of the cuftoms, it amounted to no lefs than 6,250,000!. ; but notwithllanding this (how of Wealth, the trade carried on at Cairo contributes very little to the enriching of the neople. This will readily appear, when we confider, that great part of the coffee and ether merchandife brought from India is exported to foreign countries, the value being paid in goods from Turkey and other European countries ; while the coun¬ try confumption confifts entirely, or moftiy, in articles of luxury already finiffied, and the produce given in re¬ turn is moftiy in raw materials",Cairo,"IN,TR,EG",5,"India,Turkey,Egypt","Asia,Asia,Africa"
"Schemes have frequently been proje£led of enlarging Etyi !l 164 through thet_]ie corTimerce Gf Egypt by cutting through the ifth- ' uesT"" Tnus Suez> and thus joining the Mediterranean and Red feas by a canal. This is looked upon by M",,EG,5,Egypt,Africa
"Volney as impra£ticable» He owns, indeed, that no objection can arife from the diftance, which is not more than 18 or 19 leagues 5 neither does any ob- ftacle arife from mountains, or the inequality of levels, the whole being a fandy barren plain. The difficulty, which he confiders as infuperable, proceeds from the nature of the correfponding coafts of the Mediterra¬ nean and Red feas ; both of which are low and fandy, where the waters form lakes, fhoals, and moraffes, fo that fhips cannot come within a confiderable diflance of either ; and it would be fcarce poffible to cut a per¬ manent canal amidft thefe fhifting fands ; not to men¬ tion, that the fhore is deftitute of harbours, which muff be entirely the work of art. The country, befides, has not a drop of frefh water, which it would therefore be neceffary to bring as far as from the Nile. The btfl me¬ thod of effe&ing this junftion, therefore, is by means of the river itfelf; and for this the ground is perfectly well calculated. This has been already done by feveral Egyptian princes, particularly Sefoftris $ and the canal is faid to have been 170 feet wide, and deep enough for large veffels.

The conqued of Egypt was therefore projected, as a preparatory dep towards the fubjugation of the Ead Indies, to be effeCted by reaching the In¬ dian ocean through the idhmus of Suez. This was a daring, a defperate undertaking ; and no military cha¬ racter of which France could boad, was confidered as equal to its fuccefsful execution but the hero of Maren¬ go.

After a number of fubfequent battles and inferior Ikirmilhes which the republicans fought with various fuccefs, they feemed willing to evacuate Egypt upon certain conditions, which met with the approba¬ tion of Sir Sidney Smith ; but they were afterwards re- jefted by a fpeciefc of policy for which it is difficult to account, and frelh obftacles were thrown in the way of the propofed evacuation. This was an event much to be defired by the republicans, according to the opinion of fome, while the French denied that the neceffity of fuch a meafure ever exifted.

"In the mean time Britain was not idle, but affive in the organization of an army deflined to invade Egypt, and compel the French troops to evacuate that country, which was too contiguous to her inettimable polfeulons in the Eaft Indies 5 and the command of it was given to that gallant and highly refpeftable officer, the late ge¬ neral Sir Ralph Abercromby, who appeared of!

A falfe attack on the left of the Britiffi army was the com¬ mencement of hoftilities, but the French were ftill more anxious to turn the right of their opponents, which they attempted in vain. With the fame fuccefs they made an attack upon the central devifion. About 200 pri- foners fell into the hands of the Britiffi ; but as their cavalry was much inferior to that of the enemy, whofe retreat was alfo covered by cannon on the oppofite hills, they could not purfue their advantages. The lofs of the Britiffi at this time was very confiderable, but the mod irreparable part of it was the lofs of the com¬ mander in chief, who was mortally wounded on the 21 ft, and died on the 28th of the famevmonth.
