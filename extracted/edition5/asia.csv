"CUNOCEPHALI,in Mythology, (from K»»»,“dog,’v and KipxM, “ head,”) a kind of baboons, or animals with heads like thofe of dogs, which were wonder¬ fully endowed, and were preferved with great venera¬ tion by the Egyptians in many of their temples. It is related, that by their aftiftance the Egyptians found out the particular periods of the fun and moon ; and that one half of the animal w7as often buried, while- the other half furvived : and that they could read and write. This ftrange hiftory, Dr Bryant imagines, re¬ lates to the priefts of Egypt, ftyled cahen, to the no¬ vices in their temples, and to the examinations they were obliged to undergo, before they could be ad¬ mitted to the priefthood. The Egyptian colleges were fituated upon rocks or hills, called caph, and from- their confecration to the fun, caph-el; whence the Greeks deduced KSpfljXjj, and fromctf/zf»-c«/>/$-e/they form¬ ed x.vvtKYi<p£6X'js. So that cahen-caph-el was fome royal feminary in Upper Egypt, whence they draughted novi¬ ces to fupply their colleges and temples. By this etymology he explains the above hiftory. The death si- cup of one part, while the other furvived, denoted the re¬ gular fucceftion of the Egyptian priefthood. The cu- \10cephali are alfo found in India and other parts of the world.

"CURACOA, or CuRASSOW, one of the larger An¬ tilles iflands, formerly iubjedl to the Dutch j fituated in W. Long. 68i 30* N. Lat. 1 2. 30. This ifland is little elfe than a bare rock, about ten leagues long and five broad •, lying three leagues off the coaft of Vene¬ zuela. It has an excellent harbour, but the entrance is difficult. The bafon is extremely large, and conve¬ nient in every refpedl ; and is defended by a fort fkil- fully conftrudled, and always kept in repair. The rea- fon of forming a fettlement upon this barren fpot, was to carry on a contraband trade with the Spanilh colonies on the continent j but after fome time the method of managing this trade was changed. Curaffow itfelf became an immenfe magazine, to which the Spaniards reforted in their boats to exchange gold, filver, va¬ nilla, cocoa, cochineal, bark, {kins, and mules, for ne¬ groes, linen, filks, India fluffs, fpices, laces, ribbands, quickfilver, fteel, and iron-ware.

"In the fea, currents are either natural and general, as arifing from the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis 3 or accidental and particular, caufed by the waters being driven againft promontories, or into gulfs and ftraits, where, wanting room to fpread, they are driven back, and thus difturb the ordinary flux of the fea. Currents are various, and directed towards different parts of the ocean, of which fowe Z l 7 ] CUR are conflant, others periodical. The moft extraordi¬ nary current of the fea is that by which part of the Atlantic or African ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the curvature or bay of Africa which they call Fernando Poo ; viz. from weft to eaft* contrary to the general motion : and fuch is the force of the current, that when Ihips approach too near the Ihore, it carries them violently towards that bay, and deceives the mariners in their reckoning. There’ is a great variety of ftiifting currents, which do not laft, but return at certain periods : and thefe do, moft of them, depend upon and follow the anniverfary winds or monfoons, which by blowing in one place may caufe a current in another. Varenius informs us, that at Java, in the ftraits of Sunda, when the monfoons blow from the weft, viz. in the month of May, the currents fet to the call ward, contrary to the general motion. Between the ifland of Celebes and Madura, when the weftern monfoons fet in, viz. in December^ January, and February, or when the winds blow from the north-weft, or between the north and weft, the currents fet to the fouth-eaft, or between the foutli and eafl. At Ceylon, from the middle of March to Odfober, the currents let to the fouthward, and in the other parts of the year to the northward : becaufe at this time the fouthern monfoons blow, and' at the other the northern. Between Cochin-China and Ma¬ lacca, when the weftern msnfoons blow, viz. from April to Auguft, the currents fet eaftward againft the general motion 3 but the reft of the year they fet weft ward, the monfoon confpiring with the general motion. They run fo ftrongly in thefe feas, that un¬ experienced failors miftake them for waves that beat upon the rocks, known uiually by the name of break¬ ers. So for fome months after the 15th of February, the currents fet from the Maldives towards India cm the eaft, againft the general motion of the fea. On the ffiore of China and Cambodia, in the months of Odto- ber, November, and December, the currents fet to the north-weft, and from January to the fouth-weft,. whsn they run with fuch rapidity about the ftioals of Parcel, that they feem fwifter than an arrow.. A t Pulo Ccn- dore, upon the coaft of Cambodia, though the mon¬ foons are fhiftmg, yet the currents fet ftrongly to¬ wards the eaft, even when they blow to a contrary point. Along the coafts of the bay of Bengal, as far as the Cape Romania, at the extreme point of Malacca* the current runs fouthward in November and December. When the monfoons blow from China to Malacca, the fea runs fwiftly from Pulo Cambi to Pulo Condore on the coaft of Cambodia. In the bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope, there is a current particularly remarkable, where the ffa runs from eaft to weft to the landward j and this more vehemently, as it is oppofed by winds from a contrary dire&ion. The caufe is undoubtedly owing to fome adjacent ftiore which is higher than this. In the ftraits of Gibraltar the currents almoft conftantly drive to the eaftward, and carry ftiips into the Medi¬ terranean 3 they are alfo found to drive the fame way into St George’s channel","March, Along, Malacca, Malacca","CN,KH,IN,GI,MY,GN,MV,GB",5,"China,Cambodia,India,Gibraltar,Malaysia,Guinea,Maldives,United Kingdom","Asia,Asia,Asia,Europe,Asia,Africa,Asia,Europe"
"The natural appetites above-mentioned, differ from habit in the following particular : they have an unde¬ termined diredlion toward all objedls of gratification in general ; whereas an habitual appetite is diredled to a particular objedt : the attachment we have by ha¬ bit to a particular woman, differs widely from the na¬ tural paffion which comprehends the whole fex j and D the (a) Violent love, without affedlion, is finely exemplified in the following ftory. When Conftantinople was taken by the Turks, Irene, a young Greek of an illuftrious family, fell into the hands of Mahomet II. who was at that time in the prime of youth and glory. His favage heart being fubdued by her charms, he fhut him- felf up with her, denying accefs even to his minifters. Love obtained fuch afcendant as to make him frequent¬ ly abandon the army, and fly to his Irene. War relaxed, for vidlory was no longer the monarch’s favourite paffion. The foldiers, accuftomed to booty, began to murmur, and the infedlion fpread even among the com¬ manders. The Baffia Muftapha, confulting the fidelity he owed his mafter, was the firft who durft acquaint him of the difcourfes held publicly to the prejudice of his glory. The fultan, after a gloomy filence, formed his refolution. He ordered Muftapha to affemble the troops next morning j and then with precipitation retired to Irene’s apartment. Never before did that princefs appear fo charming j never before did the prince beftow fo many warm careffes. To give a new luftre to her beauty, he exhorted her women next morning to beftow their utmoft art and care on her drefs. He took her by the hand, led her into the middle of the army, and pulling off her veil demanded of the baflias with a fierce look, whether they had ever beheld fuch a beauty ? After an awful paufe, Mahomet with one hand laying hold of the young Greek by her beautiful locks, and with the other pulling out his fcimitar, fevered the head from the body at one ftrnke. Then turning to his grandees, with eyes wild and furious, “ This fword (fays he), when it is my will, knows to cut the bands of love.” However ftrange it may appear, we leatn from experience, that defire of enjoyment may confift with the moft brutal averfion, directed both to the fame woman.

"The natives pronounce it tear, or -zaar; and this, by corruption (it has been fancied), from Cafar, “ em- peror,” from fome imagined relation to the Roman emperors. But this etvmology does not feem corre£E When the czar Peter formerly required of the Euro¬ pean courts an acknowledgement of his imperial titles, i, and that the appellation of Emperor tt\ould never be omitted, there was great difficulty made about it, elpecially at the court of Vienna ; which occafioned him to produce the famous letter, written in the Ger¬ man tongue, from Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, to Vaffili Ivanovitch, confirming a treaty of alliance offenfive and defenfive againft Sigifmund king of Po¬ land. In this difpatch, which is dated Auguft the 4th, 1514, and is ratified with the feal of the golden bull, Maximilian addreffts Vaffili by calling him Kayfer and Herrfcher aller Rujfen, “ emperor and ruler of all the Ruffias.” But independently of this document, there could be no doubt that the foreign courts, in their intercourfe with that of Mofcow, ftyled the fove- reigns indilcriminately Great Duke, Czar, and Em¬ peror. With refpeft to England in particular, it is certain that in Chancellor’s Account of Ruffia, fo early as the middle of the 16th century, Ivan Vaffilie- vitch II. is called Lord and Emperor of all Ruf/ia ; and in the Englith difpatches, from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Anne, he is generally addreffed under the fame appellation.

But ^ the moft particular hillory of the deluge, and the near¬ ed of any to the account given by Mofes, is to be found in Lucian. He was a native of Samofata, a city of Comagene, upon the Euphrates, a part of the world where memorials of the deluge were par¬ ticularly preferved, and where a reference to that hi ‘lory was Continually kept up in the rites and worlhip of the country.

The prefent world is peopled from the fons of Deucalion j having increafed to fo great a number from one perfon. In refpef! to the former brood, they were men of violence, and lawlefs so their dealings. They regarded not oaths, nor ob- ferved the rights of hofpitality, nor {bowed mercy to thofe who (ued for it. On this account they were doomed to deftruflion ; and for this purpofe there was a mighty eruption of waters from the earth, attended with heavy {bowers from above j fo that the rivers {welled, and the fea overflowed, till the whole earth was covered with a flood, and all flefli drowned. Deu- calion' alone was preferved to repeople the world, i his mercy was fhown to him on account of his piety and juftice. His prefervatiun was effedted in this man¬ ner : He put all his family, both his fons and their wives, into a vaft ark which he had provided, and he went into it himfelf. At the fame time animals of every fpecies, boars, horfes, lions, ferpents, whatever lived upon the face of the earth, followed him by pairs; all which he received into the ark, and experienced no evil from them ; for there prevailed a wonderful harmony throughout, by the immediate influence of the Deity. Thus were they wafted with him as long as the flood endured.’ After this he proceeds to mention, that upon the difappearing of the waters, Deucalion went forth from the ark, and raifed an altar to God ; but he tranfpofes the feene to Hierapolis in Syria, where the natives pretended, as has been al¬ ready mentioned, to have very particular memorials of 9 the deluge",,"AM,SY",5,"Armenia,Syrian Arab Republic","Asia,Asia"

As the deity, in the (econd temple of Syrian, to which ftrangers were not admitted, was not of a hit¬ man form, and was called Dagun, we may eafily con¬ ceive the bidden'ehara£ler under which he was defcri- bed.

But by Dagon is fignified the very perfon through whom the earth has been already reftored when it was in a ftate of ruin, and by whom mankind was renewed. Dagon and Noah, I have ftiown to be the fame. Viftinou is reprefented, like Dagon, under the mixed figure of a man and a fifti, or rather of a man, a princely figure, proceeding from a fifti.

It is remarkable, that in Japan the pnefts and no¬ bility have the title of Garni.

About a quarter of a German mile before you come to this village, flands a famous temple of the god Abutto ; which is faid to be very eminent for miraculoufly curing many invete¬ rate diftempers, as alfo for procuring a wind and good paffage. for this reafon, failors and palfengers al¬ ways tie fome farthings to a piece of wood, and throw it into the fea, as an offering to this Abutto, to obtain a favourable wind.

"The horfe of Neptune was another emblem, as was alfo the hippopotamus or river-horfe. The people of Elis made ufe of the tortoife for the fame purpofe, and reprefented Venus as refting upon its back. Some traces of thefe hieroglyphics are to be found in Japan, which were certainly carried thither by the Indie E- thiopians",,JP,5,Japan,Asia
"“ From an account of a temple of Daiboth (probably the fame with Daibod) at Meaco in Japan, we may perceive that the people there fpeak of the renewal of the world at the deluge as the real creation, which I have fhown to be a common miftake in the hiftories of the event. And though the ftory is told with fome variation, yet in all the circumftances of confequence it accords very happily with the mythology of Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It matters not how the emblems have by length of time been mifinterpreted. We have the mundane egg upon the waters, and the concomi¬ tant fymbol of the moon ; and the egg at la A opened by the afliftance of the facred fleer, upon which, the world iflues forth to this day.” The author proceeds afterwards to mention the great veneration paid in thefe parts to the ox and cow j and fays, that nobody dares injure them. One deity of the Japanefe was Canon, the reputed lord of the ocean. He was repre¬ fented in an ere<fl pofture, crowned w'ith a flower, and coming out of the mouth of a fifli. He is reprefented in the fame manner by the natives of India, and named Vijhnou and Macauter ; and he is to be found in other parts of the eaft. Father Boufhet mentions a tradi¬ tion among the Indians concerning a flood in the days of Vithnou which covered the whole earth. It is moreover reported of him, that feeing the prevalence of the waters, he made a float *, and being turned into a fifh, he fleered it with his tail. This perfon, in the account of the Banians by Lord, is called Menow; which certainly fhould be expreffi d Men-Now. It is faid, that in the Shafter of this people, a like hiftory is given of the earth being overwhelmed by a deluge, in which mankind perilhed 5 but the world was after¬ wards renewed in two perfons called Menou and Cete- roupa. Vilhnou is deferibed under many characters, which he is faid at times to have aflumed. One of thefe, according to the bramins of Tanjour, was that of Rama Sami. This undoubtedly is the fame as Sama Rama of Babylonia, only reverfed : and it relates to that great phenomenon the Iris ; which was generally accompanied with the dove, and held in veneration by the Semarim","Shafter, Sama, Rama","JP,EG,SY,GR,IN,US,ES,NI",5,"Japan,Egypt,Syrian Arab Republic,Greece,India,United States,Spain,Nicaragua","Asia,Africa,Asia,Europe,Asia,North America,Europe,North America"

TbisC ina* prince had, according to fome, the body, according to others the head, of a lerpent. If we may believe the Japanefe hiftorians, he began his reign above 21,000 years before Chrift.

"Hiftory of “ The hiftory of Japan is divided into three aeras $ Japan. which confifl. of gods, demigods, and mortals. The perfon whom the natives look upon to be the real founder of their monarchy is named Synmu ; in whofe reign the Sintoo religion, the moft ancient of the country, was introduced. It was called Sin-sju and Chami-mitfa ; from Sin and Chami, the deities which were the objects of worlhip. At this time it is faid that 600 foreign idols avere brought into Japan. To the Sintoo religion was afterwards added the Budfo, together with the worlhip of Amida. This deity they commonly reprefented with the head of a dog, and elleemed him the guardian of mankind. This re¬ ligion was mere complicated than the former, and abounded with hieroglyphical reprefentations and my- fterious rites. It is the fame which 1 have termed the Arhite Idolatry, wherein the facred fleer and cow were venerated. The deity was reprefented upon the lotus and upon a tortoife, and oftentimes as proceeding from a filh. In this alfo, under the charafter of Bud- ka, we may trace innumerable memorials of the ark, and of the perfon preferved in it. The author above, having mentioned the- eleventh emperor inclufive from Syn-Mu, tells us, that in his time thefe rites began",,JP,5,Japan,Asia
"‘In his reign Budo, otherwife called A’oZ'O/aj', came over from the Indies to Japan j and brought with him, upon a white horfe, his religion and do£lrines.’ We find here, that the object of worlhip is made the perfon who introduced it (a miftake almoft univerfally preva¬ lent) ; otherwife in this fhort account what a curious hiftory is unfolded ! “ The only people to whom we can have recourfe for any written memorials concerning thefe things are the inhabitants of India Proper. They were, we find, the perfons who introduced thefe hieroglyphics both in China and Japan. It will therefore be worth while to confider what they have tranfmitted concern¬ ing their religious opinions ; as we may from hence obtain Hill greater light towards explaining this fym- bolical worfhip. Every manifeftation of God’s good* nefs to the world was in the firft ages expreffed by an hieroglyphic j and the Deity was accordingly de- fcribed under various forms, and in different atti¬ tudes. I hefe at length were miftaken for real tranf- %urations j and ’Vifhnou was fuppofed to have ap¬ peared in different fhapes, which were flvled incarna¬ tions. In one of thefe he is reprefented under the fi¬ gure before mentioned, of a princely perfon coming out of a fifh. In another he appears with the head of a boar,-treading upon an evil daemon, which deems to be the fame as the Typbon of the Egyptians. On his head he fupports a lunette, in which are feen cities, towers, in fhort, all that the world contains. In Baldaeus we have a delineation and hiftory of this in¬ carnation. Kircher varies a little in his reprefenta- tion, yet gives him a fimilar figure of the Deity, and ftyles him Vi/hnou Barachater. By-this I ftiould think was fignified Vifhnou, 4‘ -the offspring of the filh.” The bramins fay, that there was a time when the fer- pent with a thoufand heads withdrew itfelf, and would not fupport the world, it was fo overburdened with fin. Upon this the earth funk in the great abyfs of 44 ] £> E L waters, and mankind and all that breathed perilhed. neiu But Vilhnou took upon himfelf the form above de- '! ^ fcribed, and diving to the bottom of the fea, lifted up the earth out of the waters,,and placed it, together with the ferpent of a thoufand heads, upon the back of a tortoife. ^ “ In the third volume of M. Perron’s Zendavefta Acc<>unt of there is an account given of the cofmogony of thethe cofmo' Perfees ; alfo of the fubfequent great events that en- deWe'^ fued. The fupreme Deity, called by him Ormifdaygw<!bythe is faid to have accomplilhed the creation at fix dif-^erfees» ferent intervals. He firft formed the heavens j at the fecond the waters; at the third the earth. Next in order were produced the trees and vegetables: in the fifth place were formed birds and fifties, and the wild inhabitants of the woods; and in the fixth and laft place, he created man. The man thus produced k faid to have been an ox-like perfon, and is defcribed as confiding of a purely divine and a mortal part",,"JP,CN",5,"Japan,China","Asia,Asia"
"He is fpoken of both as a ftar and a fun. At the fame time he is mentioned as a perfon upon earth under three forms. By Tafchter is certainly fignified De AJhter; the fame perfon whom the Greeks and Sy¬ rians reprefented as a female, and called AJlarte. She was defcribed horned, and fometimes with the head of a bull; fuppofed to proceed from an egg ; and they efteemed her the fame as Juno and the moon. At laft it was thought proper to bring an univerfal inun¬ dation over the face of the earth ; that all impurity might be walhed away ; which being aecompliftied rby Tafchter, every living creature perilhed, and the earth was for fome time entirely covered. At laft, the wa¬ ters retreating within their proper bounds, the moun¬ tain of Albordi in Ferakh-kand firft: appeared ; which the author compares to a tree, and fuppofes that all other mountains proceeded from it. After this there was a renewal of the world ; and the earth was reftored to its .priftine ftate. The particular place where Or- mifda planted the germina from whence all things were to fpring, was Ferakh-kand, which feems to be the land of Arach; the country upon the Araxes in Armenia.” Thus we have given an ample fpecimen of this very ingenious author’s method of reafoning, and difcover- •ing traces of the facred hiftory even in things which have been thought leaft to relate to it. That the ’Greeks and weftern nations had fome knowledge of DEL [ ! Deluge, tlie flood, has never been denied ; and from what has t——v-— been already related, it appears that the fame has per¬ vaded the remoteft regions of the eaft. The know¬ ledge which thefe people have of the fall of man, and the evil confequences which enfued, cannot, according to our author, be the confequences of their intercourfe with Chriflians : for their traditions afford neither any traces of Chriftianity, nor its founder. Whatever truths may be found in their writings, therefore, muft be de¬ rived from a more ancient fource. “ There are (fays he) in every climate fome fhattered fragments of ori¬ ginal hiftory ; fome traces of a primitive and univerfal language : and thefe may be obferved in the names of deities, terms of worfhip, and titles of honour, which prevail among nations widely feparated, who for ages had no connexion. The like may be found in the names of pagodas and temples; and of fundry other obje&s which will prefent themfelves to the traveller",,AM,5,Armenia,Asia
"Ions ieem principally to have been that he could not partial de- conceive how an univerfal deluge could happen. “ To luge, effeft this (fays he) many miracles muft have concur¬ red 5 but God works no miracles in vain. What need was there to drown thofe lands where no men lived, or are yet to be found ! ’Tis a.foolifb thing to think that mankind had multiplied fo much before the flood as to have overfpread all the earth. How flow and fluggifh the firft men were in propagating their kind, is evident from hence, that Noah was but the ninth in a lineal defcent from Adam. They are quite wide of the truth, therefore, who think mankind to have fpread over all the earth in the days of Noah, who perhaps at that time had not extended themlelves beyond the borders of Syria and Mefopotamia : but no realon ob¬ liges us to extend the inundation of the deluge be¬ yond thofe bounds which are inhabited 5 yea, it is al¬ together abfurd to aver,, that the effeft of a punifhment inflitfted upon mankind only, fhould extend to thofe p aces where no men lived. Although we fhould there¬ fore believe that part of the earth only to have been overflowed.",,SY,5,Syrian Arab Republic,Asia
"and which may be all fummed up in the three follow-yet^ ing articles: 1. The impoflibility, in a natural way, of accounting for the quantity of water, neceffary to overflow the whole world ; 2. The fmall number of mankind fuppofed at that time to have exifted on the earth ; and, 3. The inutility of an univerfal de¬ luge, when the divine purpofts could have been equal¬ ly well anfwered by a partial one. But to all this we may make one general anfwer, that a partial deluge is in the nature of things impoflible. We cannot imagine that the waters could accumulate upon any country without going off to the fea, while the lat¬ ter retained its ufual level ; neither can we fuppofe any part of the fea to remain above the level of the reft. On the fuppofition of Bifliop Stillingfleet, there¬ fore, that the deluge extended over the whole conti¬ nent of Afia, we know that it muft have covered the high mountains of Ararat, on which the ark reftedj Caucafus, Taurus, &c. The height of Ararat is in- determined, as no traveller of any credit pretends to have sfcended to its top; but from the diftance at which it is feen, we can fcarce look upon it to be in¬ ferior to the moft celebrated mountains of the old continent*.

"This confideration alone is fufficient to (how, that if there was a deluge at all, it muft have been univerfal with regard to the world as well as the human race j and the poflibility of fuch a deluge by natural means has already been evinced. Under the article Antedi¬ luvians it is (hown, that, according to the mod mo¬ derate compulation, the world mud have been vadly more full of people than at prefent. The lead calcu¬ lation there made indeed feems incredible, fince, ac¬ cording to it, the world mud have contained upwards of 68,719 times as many inhabitants as are at prefent to be met with in the empire of China, the mod po¬ pulous country in the world : but China bears a much larger proportion to the habitable part of the world than this. The violences exercifed by mankind upon one another have always been the means of thinning their numbers, and preventing the earth from being overdocked with inhabitants •, and the drong expref- fion in Scripture, that the “ earth was filled with vio¬ lence diows that it mud have gone to an extraordi¬ nary height. But though this violence mud have un¬ doubtedly thinned the old world of its inhabitants, it mud likewife have difperfed fome of them into didant regions. There is therefore no reafon for fuppofing that before the fiood the human race were not driven into the remoted regions of the habitable world, or that America was deditute of inhabitants then more than it is at prefent. At any rate, the fchemes of Vodius and Coetlogon, who would confine the whole race of mankind to a fmall part of Afia, mud appear evidently futile and erroneous in the highed degree",,CN,5,China,Asia
"“ If now this fuppofition be embraced, by it we prefently clear ourfelves of many difficulties concern¬ ing the propagation of animals in the world, and their confervation in the ark ; as how the unknown kind of ferpent in Brazil, the flow-bellied creature in the In¬ dies, and all thofe drange fpecies of animals feen in the Wed Indies, (hould either come into the ark of Noah, or be conveyed out of it into thofe countries which are divided by fo vad an ocean on one fide, and at lead fo large a trad of land on the other. Befides, fome kind of animals cannot live out of the climate where they are ; and there are many forts of animals difcovered in America, and the adjoining idands, which have left no remainder of themfelves in thefe parts of the world. And it feems drange, that thefe diould propagate in thofe parts of the world from the place of the dood, and leave none at all of their number be¬ hind them in thefe parts whence they were propaga- ted.” ... 35 To this Mr Cockburn, in his treatife on the deluge, Replies by- replies, 1. That as it pleafed God to create only one Mr ^ock“ man and one woman at the beginning, and their pode-^urn’ rity were fufficient to overfpread the earth, it might well be fuppofed to be furnidied with animals from an original p-ur of each. 2. On the fuppofition of many pairs of brute animals having been created originally, they mud, when the human race were few in number, have multiplied to fuch a degree as to render the world uninhabitable. In confirmation of this, he informs us from the accounts of the Indian miffionaries, that in 36 the kingdom of Champua in the Indies, the river cal- Countries led bv the natives TYflacorew, but by the Portuguefe rei^r<[c!

"fpoils of the fea, the {hells and other marine bodies, v~“ are left in fuch prodigious numbers, and in heaps upon heaps in the earth, befides thofe which have long fince periflied, that they could not have been left in fuch quantities, had not the feas occupied much the fame fpace as they do now.” This argument, however, is thought by Mr Cockburn to be alfo inconclufive : “ For (fays he), 1. Animal food, whether fiffi or flefli, was not ufed by mankind before the deluge : but, 2. Suppofe it had, yet for the firft 500 years the num¬ ber of mankind was but ftnall, and likely at a great dillance from the fea j fo that the increafe of all kinds of fiffi during fo long a time muft have been prodigi¬ ous. We need not be furprifed, then, at the immenfe quantities of the exuvias of marine animals left on the earth by the deluge. But the r^afon he brings to prove that the feveral continents of the world were encompafled with feas as they are now, viz. that as there are different forts of fifties in the different feas of the world, fo the exuviae of the fame kind are ge¬ nerally found upon contiguous lands, does not always hold, fince there are fome (hells found in the continent which are ftrangers to the parts of the fea contermi¬ nous to thefe continents. That the feas in the pre¬ fent earth are vaftly more extended, and confequently the dry land fo much lefs in proportion, may likewife be inferred from the great multitude of iflands that lie near the (bores of the greater continents, if it be true what fome allege, that they are parts broken off by the deluge from the main land, which before that reached to and beyond them. And though iflands are thought to be rarely found in the great ocean, yet there have of late been found in the midft of the Indian ocean vaft clufters of iflands, &c",,IN,5,India,Asia

We read, however, that in the time of Ariftotle divers ufed a kind of kettle, to enable them to continue longer under the water j but the man¬ ner in which it was employed is not clearly deferi- bed. The oldeft information which we have of the ufe of the diving-bell in Europe, is that of John Taifnier, who was born in Hainault in 1509, and had a place at court under Charles V. whom he attended on his voyage to Africa. He relates in what man¬ ner he faw at Toledo, in the prefence of the emperor and feveral thoufand fpe&ators, two Greeks let them¬ felves down under water, in a large inverted kettle, with a burning light, and rife up again without being wet. It appears that this art was then new to the emperor and the Spaniards, and that the Greeks were caufed to make the experiment in order to prove the poflibility of it.” “ When the Englifh, in 1588, difperfed the Spanifh fleet, called the Invincible Armada, part of the (hips went to the bottom, near the Ifle of Mull, on the weft- ern coaft of Scotland *, and fome of thefe, according to the account of the Spanifh prifoners, contained great riches.

In the year 1665, a perfon was fo fortunate as to bring up forne cannon, which, however, were not fufficient to defray the expences. Of thefe attempts, and the kind of diving bell ufed in them, the reader will find an ac¬ count in a work printed at Rotterdam in 1669, an<^ entitled G.

In the year 1680, William Phipps, a native of America, formed a project for ftarching and unload¬ ing a rich Spanilh (hip funk on the coaft of Hifpaniola ; and reprefented his plan in fuch a plaufible manner, that King Charles II. gave him a Ihip, and furniftied him with every thing neceflary for the undertaking. He fet fail in the year 1683 •, but being unfuccefsful, re¬ turned again in great poverty, though with a firm con- viflion of the poftibility of his fcheme. By a fubfcrip- tion, promoted chiefly by the ,duke of Albemarle, the fon of the celebrated Monk, Phipps was enabled, in 1687, to try his fortune once more, having previoufly engaged to divide the profit according to the twenty ftiares of which the fubfcription confifted. At firft all his labour proved fruitlefs ; but at laft, when his pa¬ tience was almoft entirely exhaufted, he was fo lucky as to bring up, from the depth of fix or feven fathoms, fo much treafure that he returned to England with the value of two hundred thoufand pounds fterling. Of this fuin he himfelf got about fixteen, others fay twenty thoufand, and the duke ninety thoufand pounds. After he came back, fome perfons endeavoured to perfuade the king to feize both the Ihip and the cargo, under a pretence that Phipps, when he folicited for his ma- jefty’s permiflion, had not given accurate information refpefting the bufinefs. But the king anfwered, with much greatnefs of mind, that he knew Phipps to be an honeft man, and that he and his friends fhould lhare the whole among them had he returned with double the value.

In reality, the chords carry exaXly the fame notes, are figured in the fame manner, are employed upon the fame chord of the tone, in luch a manner, that frequenny we cannot dif- cern which of the two chords the author employs, but by the afliftance of the fubfequent chord, which re- folves it, and which is different in thefe different cafesi To make this diftinXion, we muft confider the dia¬ tonic progrefs of the two notes which form the fifth and the fixth, and which, conftituting between them the interval of a fecond, muft one or the other confti- tufe the diffonance of the chord. Now this progrefs is determined by the motion of the bafs. Of thefe two notes, then, if the fuperior be the diffonance, it will rile by one gradation into the fubfequent chord, the lower note will keep its place, and the higher note will be a fuperadded fixth. If the lower be the diffo¬ nance, it will defeend into the fubfequent chord, the higher will remain in its place, and the chord will be that of the great fixth.

The confequence was, as might be ex- pefled, by reafoning on matters not fufceptible of de- monflration, and guided by the abftrafl principles of an unintelligible logic, they divided into a multitude of fefls and opinions. At this period, too, the civil power loft its authority j and religion, which from that derives the means of preferving its unity, {hared the fame fate, and the Mahometans now experienced what had before befallen the Chriftians. The nations which had received the religion of Mahomet, mixed with it their former abfurd notions j and the errors which had anciently prevailed over Afia again made their appear¬ ance, though altered in their forms.

"In the year of the Hegira 386 (A. D. 996), the third caliph of the race of the Fatimites, called Hakem- Vamr-ellah, fucceeded to the throne of Egypt at the age of 1 x years. He was one of the mod extraordinary princes of whom hidory has preferved the memory. He taufed the fird caliphs, the companions of Mahomet, t6 be curfed in the mofques, and afterwards revoked the anathema : He compelled the Jews and Chndians to abjure their religion, and then permitted them to refume It. He prohibited the making dippers for women, to prevent them from coming out of their homes. He burnt one half of the city of Cairo for his diverfion, -while his foldiers plundered the other. Not contented with thefe extravaganta&ions, he forbade the pilgrimage to Mecca, fading, and the five prayers j and at length carried his madnefs fo far as to defire to pafs for God himfelf. He ordered a regider of thofe who acknow¬ ledged him to be fo, and the number amounted to fix- teen thoufand. This impious pfetenfion was fupported by a falfe prophet, who came from Perfia into Egypt ; which impodor, named Mohammed ben-Ifmael, taught that it was not neceflary to fad or pray, to pra&ife cir- cumcifion, to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, or obferve fedivals •, that the prohibition of pork and wine was ab- furd •, and that marriage between brothers and fiders, fathers and children, was lawful.

"In the following year Ali Bey declared war, and at¬ tacked Damafcus. Youfef, called on by the Turks, took part in the quarrel, but without being able to draw the Drufes from their mountains to enter into the army of the Ottomans. Befides their natural re¬ pugnance, at all times, to make war out of their coun¬ try, they were on this occafion too much divided at home to quit their habitations, and they had reafon to congratulate themfelves on the event. The battle of Da¬ mafcus enfued and the Turks, as we have already feen, were completely routed. The pacha of Saide efcaping from this defeat, and not thinking himlelf in fafety in that town, fought an afylum even in the houfe of the emir Youfef. The moment was unfavourable ; but the face of affairs foon changed by the flight of Mohammed Bey. The emir, concluding that Ali Bey was dead, and not imagining that Daher was powerful enough fingly to maintain the quarrel, declared openly againft: him. Saide was threatened with a fiege, and he de¬ tached 1500 men of his fadlion to its defence ; while- himfelf in perfon, prevailing on the Drufes and Ma¬ ronites to follow him, made an incurfion with 25,000 peafants into the valley of Bekaa 5 and in the abfence of the Motoualis, who had joined the army of Daher, laid the whole country wafte with fire and fword from Balbec to Tyre",Tyre,LB,5,Lebanon,Asia
"The emir Youfef, afliamed of this defeat, efcaped to Dair-el-Kama, and fliortly after attempted to take revenge j but being again defeated in the plain between Saide and Sour (Tyre), he was conftrained to relign to his uncle Manfour the ring, which among the Dru¬ fes is the fymbol of command. In 1773 he was reftor- ed by a new revolution 5 but he could not fupport his power but at the expence of a civil war. In order, therefore, to prevent Bairout falling into the hands of the adverfe fadlion, he requefled the affillance of the Turks, and demanded of the pacha of Damafcus a man of fuflicient abilities to defend that city. The choice fell on an adventurer, who from his fubfequent fortune, merits to be made known",Tyre,LB,5,Lebanon,Asia
"It mull be owned, however, that poflibly to this con¬ flict between contending parties the whole nation owes 4 the good fortune of never having been enflaved by its T) f, chief. i . es^ This chief, called Hakem or governor, alfo Emir or prince, is a fort of king or genera], who unites in his own perfon the civil and military powers. His dignity is fometimes tranfmitted from father to fon, fometimes from one brother to another j and the fuc- ceflion is determined rather by force than any certain laws. Females can in no cafe pretend to this inheri¬ tance. They are already excluded from fucceffion in civil affairs, and confequently can ftill lefs expeCl it in political : in general, the Afiatic governments are too turbulent, and their adminiftration renders milita¬ ry talents too neceffary, to admit of the fovereignty of women. Among the Drufes the male line of any fa¬ mily being extinguilhed, the government devolves to him who is in poffeflion of the greatefl number of fuf- frages and refources. But the firll flep is to obtain the approbation of the Turks, of whom he becomes the vaffal and tributary. It even happens, that, not un- frequently to affert their fupremacy, they name the Hakem, contrary to the wifties of the nation, as in the cafe of Ifmael Hafbeya, raifed to that dignity by Djezzar j but this eonltraint iafts no longer than it is maintained by that violence which gave it birth. The office of the governor is to watch over the good order of the ftate, and to prevent the emirs, lhaiks, and villages, from making war on each other : in cafe of dilobedience, he may employ force. He is alfo at the head of the civil power, and names the cadis, only always referving to himfelf the power of life and death. He collefts the tribute, from which he an¬ nually pays to the pacha a ftated fum. This tribute varies in proportion as the nation renders itfelf more or lefs formidable: at the beginning of this cen¬ tury, it amounted to 160 purfes, 8330!.*, but Mel- hem forced the Turks to reduce it to 60. In 1784 Emir Youfef paid 80 and promifed 90. This tribute, which is called Miri, is impofed on the mulberry trees, vineyards, cotton, and grain. All town land pays in",Miri,MY,5,Malaysia,Asia
"“ The Drufes have another point of honour, that of hofpitality. Whoever prefents himfelf at their door in the quality of a fuppliant or paffenger, is fure of be¬ ing entertained with lodging and food in the moft generous and unaffeCted manner. M. Volney often faw the loweft peafants give the laft morfel of bread they had in their houfes to the hungry traveller 5 and when it was obferved to them that they wanted prudence, their anfvver was, ‘ God is liberal and great, and all men are brethren.’ There are, therefore, no inns in their country any more than in the reft of Turkey",,TR,5,Turkey,Asia
"“ The Druids have alfo the prejudices of the Be¬ douins refpe&ing birth j like them, they pay great refpeCt to the antiquity of families j but this produces no effential inconveniences. The nobility of the emirs and {haiks does not exempt them from paying tribute in proportion to their revenues. It confers on them no prerogatives, either in the attainment of landed property or public employments.

In our days of peace, when Edinburgh, no alarm of an enemy is at all probable, great part of ——y— the walls, with all the gates, have been taken down, and the city laid quite open, in order to afford more ready paffage to the great concourfe of people with whom the ftreet is daily filled. But at the period we fpeak of, not only were the inhabitants much lefs numerous by reafon of the fmall extent of the city, but it was depopulated by a dreadful plague j fo that, to flop if poffible the progrefs of the infedfion, all houfes and (hops were (hut up for 14 days, and fome where infedled perfons had died were pulled down al¬ together. s In 1504, the traft of ground called the Bwrror/^^Eredtion of Muir was totally overgrown with wood, though now wooden it affords not the fmalleft veftige of having been in^011!6** fuch a ftate. So great was the quantity at that time, however, that it was enadted by the town council, that whoever inclined to purchafe as much wood as was fufficient to make a new front for their koufe, might extend it feven feet into the ftreet. Thus the city was in a (hort time filled with houfes of wood inftead of ftone j by which, befides the inconvenience of ha¬ ving the ftreet narrowed 14 feet, and the beauty of the whole entirely marred, it became much more lia¬ ble to accidents by fire : but almoft all thefe are now pulled down 5 and in doing this a fingular tafte in the mafonry which fupported them is faid to have been dif- covered. 9 In 1542, a war with England having commenced Edinburgh through the treachery of Cardinal Beaton, an Engliffi cleHroyecI fleet of 200 fail entered the Forth j and having landed ^7 their forces, quickly made themfelves mailers of the 'a towns of Leith and Edinburgh. They next attacked the caftle, but were repulfed from it with lofs ; and by this they were fo enraged, that they not only deftroyed the towns of Edinburgh and Leith, but laid wafte the country for a great way round.—Thefe towns, hoAV- ever, fpeedily recovered from their ruinous ftate ; and, in 1547, Leith was again burned by the Englifli after the battle of Pinkey, but Edinburgh was fpared. ie Several difturbances happened in this capital at the gjege 0f tj1<5 time of the Reformation, of which an account is given caftle in under the article Scotland ; but none of thefe greatly C^ueen^Eli- affeded the city till the year 1570, at which timezabeth’s there was a civil war on account of Q.

"Soon after the building of this wall, a new ftreet was formed on the outftde of it, named the Cowgate, which in the 16th century became the refidence of the nobility, the fenators of the college of juftice, and other perfons of the firft diftindlion. After the fatal battle of Flowden, however, the inhabitants of the Cowgate became very anxious to have themfelves defended by a wall as well as the reft. The wall of the city was therefore extended to its prefent limits. This new wall begins on the fouth-eaft ftde of the rock on which the caftle is built, and to which the town wall comes quite clofe. From thence it defcends obliquely to the Weft Port ■ then afcends part of a hill on the other ftde, called the High Riggs ; after which, it runs eaft- ward -with but little alteration in its courfe, to the Brifto and' Potter-row ports, and from thence to the Pleafance. Here it takes a northerly direction, which it keeps from thence to the Cowgate port j after which the enclofure is completed to the Nether-bow by the houfes of St Mary’s wynd. The original Nether-bow port being found not well adapted for defence was pulled down, and’a new one built in 1571 by the ad¬ herents of (^ueen Mary. In 1606, the late hand- fome building was eredled about 50 yards below the place where the former flood. It was two ftories high, and had an elegant fpire in the middle ; but being thought to encumber the ftreet, and the whole build¬ ing being in a crazy lituation, it was pulled down by order of the magiftrates in 1764",Mary,TM,5,Turkmenistan,Asia

This misfortune wras occafioned by the foundation having been laid, not up¬ on the folid earth, but upon the rubbilh of the houfes which had long before been built on the north fide of the High ftreet, and which had been thrown out into the hollow to the northward. Of this rubbifh there were no lefs than eight feet between the foundation of the bridge and the folid -earth.

We ob- improve ferved, that the cultivation of claflical learning has a merit of favourable influence on the living languages. It has our mother a tendency to preferve their purity from being debaf- tongue. ancj ^eir analogy from becoming irregular. In ftudying the dead languages, we find it neceffary to pay more attention to the principles of grammar than in acquiring our mother tongue. We learn our native language without attending much to its analogy and ftrufture. Of the numbers who fpeak Englifh through the Britifh dominions, but few are Ikilled in the in¬ flexion of its nouns and verbs, or able to diftinguilh between adverbs and conjunXions. Defirous only of making their meaning underflood, they are not anxi¬ ous about purity or correXnefs of fpeech. They re- jeX not an exprtflion which occurs to them, becaufe it is barbarous or ungrammatical. As they grew up they learned to fpeak from their mothers, their nurfes and others about them •, they were foon able to make known their wants, their willies, and their obferva- 66 Utility of claflical themfelves in their mother tongue without acquiring any accurate knowledge of its general principles. If thefe people find occafion to exprefs themfelves in writing, they, are fcarce more ftudious of correXnefs and elegance in writing than in fpeaking 5 or, though they may afpire after thofe properties, yet they can never attain them. But fuch writers or fpeakers can never refine any language* or reduce it to a regular analogy. Neither can they be expeXed to diftinguilh themfelves as the guardians of the purity and regularity of their native tongue, if it fliould before have attained a high degree of per- feXion. But they who, in learning a language dif¬ ferent from their native tongue, have found it necef¬ fary to pay particular attention to the principles of grammar, afterwards apply the knowledge of grammar which they have thus acquired in ufing their mother tongue j and by that means become better acquainted with its ftruXure, and learn to write and fpeak it with more correXnefs and propriety. Befides, the lan¬ guages of Greece and Rome are lo highly diftinguilh- ed for their eopioufnefs, their regular analogy, and for various other excellencies, which render them fu- perior to even the chief of modern languages, that the ftudy of them has a natural tendency to improve and enrich modern languages. If we look backwards to the 15th century, when learning began to revive in Europe, and that fpecies of learning which began firft to be cultivated was claflical literature, we find that almoft all the languages then fpoken in Europe were wretchedly poor and barbarous. Knowledge could not be communicated, nor bufinefs tranfaXed, without- calling in the aid of Latin. Claflical learning, how¬ ever, foon came to be cultivated by all ranks with en- thufiaftic eagernefs. Not only thofe defigned to pur- fue a learned profeflion, and men of fortune whofe ob- jeX was a liberal education without a view to any par¬ ticular profefiion j but even the lower ranks, and the female fex, keenly ftudied the languages and the wif¬ dom of Greece and Rome. This avidity for claflical learning was followed by many happy effeXs. But its influence was chiefly remarkable in producing an ama¬ zing change on the form of the living languages. Thefe foon became more copious and regular j and many of them have confequently attained fuch perfeXion, that the poet, the hiftorian, and the philofopher, can clothe their thoughts in them to the greatefl advantage., Cou!d vve derive no new advantage from the ftudy of the ancient languages, yet would they be worthy of our care, as having contributed fo much to raife the modern languages to their prefent improved ftate. But they can alfo conduce to the prefervation and fupport of thofe noble ftruXures which have been reared by their afliftance. The intercourfe of nations, the afiec- tation of writers, the gradual introduXion of provin¬ cial barbariftns, and various other caufes, have a ten¬ dency to corrupt and debale even the nobleft languages^ By fuch means were the languages of Greece and Rome gradually corrupted, till the language uled by a Horace, a Livy, a Xenophon, and a Menander, was loft in a jargon unfit for the purpofes of compofition","Of, Rome, Rome, Rome","GR,US,TR",5,"Greece,United States,Turkey","Europe,North America,Asia"

"the world unfiniftied, were the want of provifions for his army, and the difficulty of the pafles. Moft pro¬ bably, however, his return was haftened by the intelli¬ gence he received from the high pried of Egypt, con¬ cerning the rebellious proceedings of his brother j who, encouraged by his long abfence, bad alfumed the dia¬ dem, violated the queen, and alfo the royal concu¬ bines. On receiving this news, Sefoftris haftened from Thrace •, and at the end of nine years came to Pelu- fmm in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the fpoils of Alia. The treacherous bro¬ ther met him at this city ; and it is faid, with very little probability, that Sefoftris accepted of an invita¬ tion to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the reft of the royal family. During the continuance of the enter¬ tainment, Armais caufed a great quantity of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to deep j and as foon as they were retired to reft fet fire to the reeds. Sefoftris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of affifting him, ruffled through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thankf- giving for this wonderful deliverance, he made feveral donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire. He then took vengeance on his brother Armais, faid to be the Danaus of the Greeks, who, being on this occafion driven out of Egypt, withdrew into Greece. ^ Sefoftris now laid afide all thoughts of war, and ap-jiisgre; plied himfelf wholly to fuch works as might tend to works, the public good, and his own future reputation. In or¬ der to prevent the incurfions of the Syrians and Ara¬ bians, he fortified the eaft fide of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelufium through the defert to Helio¬ polis, for 1874 miles. He raifed alfo an incredible number of vaft and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed fuch towns as had before been fituated too low, in order to fecure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the fea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile j and not only made an eafier communication between different places, but rendered the country in a great meafure im- paffable to an enemy. He eredled a temple in every city in Egypt, and dedicated it to the fupreme deity of the place j but in the courfe of fuch a great under¬ taking as this neceffarily muft have been, he took care not to employ any of his Egyptian fubjefts. 'Ihus he fecured their aftedlion, and employed the vaft multi¬ tude of captives he had brought along with him ; and to perpetuate the memory of a tranfaflion fo remark¬ able, he caufed to be infcribed on all thefe temples, “ No one native laboured hereon.” In the city of Memphis, before the temple of Vulcan, he raifed fix gigantic ftatues, each of one (lone.

"The vaft conquefts of Sefoftris were now no longer known ; for Pfammitichus poflefied no more than the country of Egypt itfelf. It appears, indeed, that none of the fucceflbrs of Sefoftris, or even that monarch him- felf, had made ufe of any means to keep in fubje£Uon the countries he had once conquered. Perhaps, indeed, his defign originally was rather to pillage than to con¬ quer ; and therefore, on his return, his vaft empire va- niftied at once. Pfammitichus, however, endeavoured to extend his dominions by making war on his neigh¬ bours ; but by putting more confidence in foreign auxi¬ liaries than in his own fubjedts, the latter were fo much offended, that upwards of 200,000 fighting men emigrated in a body, and took up their relidence in Ethiopia. To repair this lofs, Pfammitichus earneftly applied himfelf to the advancement of commerce ; and opened his ports to all ftrangers, whom he greatly ca- reffed, contrary to the cruel maxims of his predecef- fors, who refufed to admit them into the country. He alfo laid fiege to the city of Azotus in Syria, which held out for 29 years againft the whole ftrength of the kingdom ; from which we may gather, that, as a war¬ rior, Pfammitichus was by no means remarkable.

The bad fuccefs of this alliance was fore¬ told by the prophet Jeremiah ; and accordingly it hap¬ pened. For Nebuchadnezzar having fat down with his army before Jerufalem, Apries marched-from E- gypt with a defign to relieve the city ; but no fooner did he perceive the Babylonians approaching him, than he retreated as faft as he could, leaving the Jews ex- pofed to the rage of their mercilefs enemies; who were thereupon treated as Jeremiah had foretold ; and by this ftep Apries brought upon himfelf the vengeance denounced by the fame prophet.

This he found impoflible, and therefore returned without his prifoner ; at which the king was foenragtd, that he commanded Patarbemis’s noie and ears to be cut off.

By this means the Jews were debarred from fuing to him for juftice, or obtaining his prote£l:ion when they happened to ftand in need of it. By the favour of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Soter, and Euergetes, the Jews enjoyed at Alexandria the fame privileges with the Macedonians. In that metropolis the inhabitants were divided into three ranks or claffes. In the firft were the Macedonians, the original founders of the city, and along with them were enrolled the Jews ; in the fecond were the mer¬ cenaries who had ferved under Alexander 5 and in the third the native Egyptians. Ptolemy now, to be revenged of the Jews, ordered, by another decree, that they ftiould be degraded from the firft rank, and enrolled among the native Egyptians. By the fame decree it was ena&ed, that all of that nation fliould ap¬ pear at an appointed time before the proper officers, in order to be enrolled among the common people; that at the time of their enrollment they ffiould have the mark of an ivy leaf, the badge of Bacchus, imprefled with a hot iron on their faces ; that all who were thus marked ftiould be made flaves ; and, laftly, that if any one ftiould ftand out againft this decree, he ftiould be immediately put to death.

"in 1187, the fortune of war was remarkably unfavour- able to them. The Chriftians now found themfelves obliged to venture a battle, by reafon of the cruel ravages committed in their territories by Saladin, and by reafon of the encroachments he daily made on them. Both armies therefore being refolved to exert their utmoft efforts, a moft fierce and bloody battle enfued. Night prevented vidlory from declaring on either fide, and the fight was renewed with equal ob* ftinacy next day. The viftory was (till left undecided j but the third day the fultan’s men finding themfelves furrounded by the enemy on all fides but one, and there alfo hemmed in by the river Jordan, fo that there was no room to fly, fought like men in defpair, and at laft gained a moft complete viftory.

"In 1193 Saladin died, to the inexpreffible grief of all true Mahometans, who held him in the utmoft ve¬ neration. His dominions in Syria and Paleftine were ftiared out among his children and relations into many petty principalities. His fon Othman fucceeded to the crown of Egypt ; but as none of his fucceffors pnffeffcd the enterprifing genius of Saladin, the hiitoiy from that time till the year 1250 affords nothing re- ^ markable. At this time the reigning fultan Malek A1 Mamlouk: Salek was dethroned and {lain by the Mame/ucs or Mam-becomt /ouks, as they are called, a kind of mercenary ioldiers“ia^ers^ who ferved under him.

The reafon of this inflitution origi¬ nally was, that the native Egyptians were become fo cowardly, treacherous, and effeminate, Irom a long cnurfe of flavery, that they were unfit for arms. 1 he Mamlouks, on the contrary, made moft excellent fol¬ diers } for having no friends but amongit their own corps, they turned all their thoughts to their own proteffion. ^ According to M.

They multiplied their flaves ; and after emancipating them, employed all their intereft to promote them to various employments, and advance them in the army. Thefe upftarts, retaining for their patrons the fame fuperftitious veneration common in the Eaft, formed fa&ions implicitly devoted to their plea- fure.” Thus, about the year 1746, Ibrahim, one ofAuthorit the kiayas (d) of the janizaries, rendered himfelf inufurPedl reality mafter of Egypt ; having managed matters fo^rahlm well, that of the 24 beys or fangiacs eight were of his houfehold.

Thus the pacha became alto¬ gether unable to oppofe him, and the orders of the ful- tan were lefs rtfpecled than thofe of Ibrahim.

Still, however, his ambition was not fatisfied ; and he determined on nothing lefs than to throw off his dependence on the Porte altogether, and become fultan of Egypt.

"After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an unfarmountable obftacle to the right, it turned fuddenly to the left j and taking its courfe to the fouthward of Memphis, it fpread its waters through the fands of Libya. The prince we fpeak of caufed a new bed to be dug for it to the eaft of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and difcharge itfelf into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the caftle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was flill to be feen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day acrofs the deferts, pafling to the weft- ward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs ftill beftow upon it the name of Bahr Be/ama, “ or fea without wa¬ ter,” and it is now almoft choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A reflux of the fea was occafioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themfelves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the fands and mud carried along with them were colledled into heaps ; and thus the Delta, at firft very inconfiderable, rofe out of the fea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has fince been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raifing dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to He¬ rodotus, the Delta was in its infancy ; eight cubits of water being then fufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats paffed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial emi¬ nences, refembled the iflands of the Egean fea. At the time that Herodotus vifited this country, 15 cubits ■were neceffary to cover all the Lower Egypt ; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the fpace of two days journey to the right and left of the ifland. Un¬ der the Roman empire 16 cubits performed the fame effe6I.

"“ What prodigious changes great rivers occafion on the furface of the globe ! How they elevate, at their mouths, iflands which become at length large portions of the continent! It is thus that the Nile has formed almoft all the Lower Egypt, and created out of the waters the Delta, which is 90 leagues in circumfe¬ rence. It is thus that the Meander, conftantly repel¬ ling the waves of the Mediterranean, and gradually fill¬ ing up the gulf into which it falls, has placed in the middle of the land the town of Miletus, formerly a ce¬ lebrated harbour. It is thus that the Tigris and the Euphrates, let loofe from the Armenian hills, and fweeping with them in their eourfe the fands of Me- fopotamia, are imperceptibly filling up the Perfian gulf.” 130 Thefe are the reafons afligned by M. Savary forBruce’s thinking that the Delta, as well as the greateft part uf r®afon5 the Lower Egypt, had been produced by the Nile ;[r^rC<^j but this opinion is violently contefted by othernion","Delta, Delta","CA,AM",5,"Canada,Armenia","North America,Asia"
"E G Y [ 61 the precife length of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian cubit •, and even to know the different alterations which that meafure had undergone among thofe people: But this nicety he thinks needlefs, looking upon the general fa£t to be fully eftablidied by what he had faid before. Mr Bruce, however, has treated the fubjedt with much greater accuracy. He obferves, that from the fituation of Canopus, the dillance betwixt Egypt and Cyprus, and the extenfion of the land to the north¬ ward, it appears that no addition of any confequence had been made to it for 3000 years part. The only argument left for the increafe of land therefore muft be taken from the nilometer. The ufe of this inftrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that fo it might be known whether the crop would be fufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exadted of them by the fovereign or not. The firft ftep was to know what fpace of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by menfuration, the next thing was to afcertain the produce of the ground upon an average. Thus becoming acquainted with the greateft and leaft crops produced, together with the exadl extent of ground overflowed, they were furnifh- ed with all the neceflary principles for conftru&ing a nilometer ; and nothing now remained but to eredl a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exadfly into cu¬ bits. This was accordingly done ; the pillar was firft divided into cubits, and thefe again were fubdivided into digits. The firft divifion of this kind was un¬ doubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man ; being the length of the arm from the middle of the round bone in the elbow to the point of the middle finger ; a meafure ftill in ufe among all rude nations. As no ftandard could be found by which this meafure might be exa&ly determined, authors have dif¬ fered very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and of an inch ; the other one foot and of a foot ; but Mr Bruce is of opinion' that both of thefe are too large. He found, by menfuration, the Egyptian cubit to be ex¬ actly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch ; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit ufed for determining the increafe of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increafe was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed ; but that in his time 16 or at leaft 15 cubits were neceffary to produce the fame eff-ft:. But to this account Mr Bruce obje&s, that Herodotus could have no certain information con¬ cerning the nilometer, becaufe he himfelf fays that the priefts, who alone had accefs to it, would tell him no¬ thing of the matter. Herodotus alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation ; and this fuperfluous quantity Mr Bruce fuppofes to have been conveyed in¬ to the defert for the ufe of the Arabs, and that by fuch a vaft drain the rile of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminilhed. But even granting that there was fuch a difference between the rife of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Hero¬ dotus, it does not appear that anv thing like it has appeared ever lince. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 9 ] E G Y 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that Egypt; eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in v the time of Moeris. From fome paffages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exer¬ tion of induftry to caufe this quantity of water pro¬ duce a plentiful crop ; but there is not the leaft reaion to fuppofe, that the very fame induftry was not ne¬ ceffary in the time of Moeris ; fo that ftill there is not any increafe of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian vifited Egypt, we are informed from unqueftionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the ftandard; both which accounts correfpond with that of Herodo¬ tus. Laftly, Procopius, who lived in the time of Jul* tinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requifite for a minimum. # # 13a From thefe accounts, fo various and difcordant, it is No increafe obvious that no certain conclufion can be drawn. ^ is not indeed eafy to determine the reafon of this dif- ^eafon- ference in point of fa£l. 1 he only conje&ure we can ^ fup* offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a fmafter pofed; quantity of water will anfwer the purpofe of producing a plentiful crop, fo it is not unreafonable to fuppofe that at different periods the induftry of the people has varied fo much as to occafion the difagreement in que- ftion. This would undoubtedly depend very much upon their governor ; and indeed Strabo informs us that it was by the care of the governor Petronius, that fuch a final 1 quantity of water was made to anfwer the purpofe","Roman, Memphis, Adrian","EG,US,CY,RO,GR",5,"Egypt,United States,Cyprus,Romania,Greece","Africa,North America,Asia,Europe,Europe"
"As the Nile does not always rife to a height fuffi- cient for the purpofes of agriculture, the former fove- reigns of Egypt were at vaft pains to cut proper ca¬ nals in order to fupply the deficiency. Some of thefe are ftill preferved, but great numbers are rendered ufe- lefs through the indolence or barbarity of their fuccef- fors. Thofe which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are bell taken care of by government. The laft is watched by an officer appointed for that purpofe, whofe office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bachria, who receive this fuper- fluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increafe of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by thofe who derive advantage fiom them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the pro¬ vince of Sharkia ; which, making part of the ifthmus of Suez, is the molt confiderable of Egypt, and the moft capable of a great increafe of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are pofieffed by the Arabs, would be no lefs fertile, were it not for the exceffive inclination thefe people have to deftroy, fo that they make war even with the fpontaneous prodtnftions oftheeaith. A number of other canals run through the Delta ; and the veftiges of thofe which watered the provinces to the eaftward and weft ward, (how that in former times thefe were the beft cultivated parts of Egypt. “ We may alfo prefume (fays the baron de Tott), from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the conftru&ion of the canal, and the natural level of the lands which encompafs the lake Mareotis, and extend themfelves weft ward to the kingdom of Barca, that this country, at prefent given up to the Arabs, and almoft defert, was once fufficiently rich in productions of every kind to furnifh the city of Alexander with its whole fubfiftence.” I The air and climate of Egypt are extremely hot,AjrXa^ not only from the height of the fun, which in fummerclimate approaches to the zenith, but from the w'ant of rain and Egypt* from the vicinity of thofe burning and fandy deferts which lie to the fouthward.

Mr Bruce had an opportunity of afeer- taining this fa£b in the month of June 1768 ; for at that time, while on a vovag«- from Sidon to Alexandria, he obferved great numbers of thin white clouds moving rapidly from the fouth, and in diredl oppofition to the Etefian winds","Sidon, Alexandria","LB,US",5,"Lebanon,United States","Asia,North America"
"Thefe have been diftinguilhed by various names, fuch as poifonous winds, hot winds of the defert, Hamid, the wind of Damafcus, K. infin, and Simoom. In Egypt they are denominated “ winds of 50 days,” becaufe they moft commonly prevail during the 50 days preced¬ ing and following the equinox; though, fhould they blow conftantly during one half of that time, an uni- verfal deftrudtion would be the confequence. Of thefe travellers have given various deferiptions. M. Volney fays, that the violence of their heat may be compared to that of a large oven at the moment of drawing out the bread. They always blow from the fouth ; and are undoubtedly owing to the motion of the atmofphere over fuch vaft trails of hot fand, where it cannot be fupplied by a fufficient quantity of moiflure. When they begin to blow, the Iky lofes its ufual ferenity, and aflumes a dark, heavy, and alarming afpeft, the fun himfelf laying afide his ufual fplendour, and becoming of a violet colour. This terrific appearance feems not to be occafioned by any real haze or cloud in the atmo¬ fphere at that time, but folely to the vaft quantity of fine fand carried along by thofe winds, and which is fo exceflively fubtile that it penetrates everywhere. The motion of this wind is always rapid, but its heat is not intolerable till after it has continued for fome time. Its pernicious qualities are evidently occafioned by its ex- ceflive avidity of moifture. Thus it dries and flirivels up the fkin ; and by doing the fame to the lungs, will in a ftiort time produce fuffocation and death.

"IV. The Mamlouks. Of the origin of thefe we have already given fome account: we have only, there- 4 K 2 fore, t *54 Abfurd drefs and accoutre¬ ments of the Mam- louks",Of,TR,5,Turkey,Asia
"The Mamlouks are all horfemen •, and as war is ac¬ counted the only honourable employment among them, it is reckoned difgraceful to walk on foot, none but cavalry being accounted foldiers. The other inha¬ bitants are allowed only the ufe of mules and alfes ; and the fame mark of indignity is impofed upon Eu¬ ropeans •, though by proper management and liberal prefents, this may be got over. In the year 1776 Lord Algernoun Percy, afterwards Lord Louvaine, and the earl of Charlemount, obtained permiffion to ride up¬ on horfeback. The Mamlouks, however, are not incited to this continual - appearance on horfeback merely by their fuppofed fuperiority to the reft of the inhabitants; it is rendered neceflary by their drefs, which is extreme- ly unwieldy and cumberfome. It confifts of a wide Ihirt of thin yellowith-coloured cotton ; over which is a gown of Indian linen, or fome of the light fluffs of Damafcus or Aleppo. Over this is a fecund covering of the fame form and widenefs, with fleeves reaching down to the ends of the fingers. The former covering is called antari, and the latter caftan. The caftan is ufually made of filk or fome finer fluff than the un¬ der garments ; and both of them are fattened by a long belt, which divides the whole drefs into two bundles. Over all thefe they have a third, named djon- /ia, confiding of cloth without lining, and made nearly fimilar to the others, but that the fleeves are cut in the elbow. This coat is lined, fometimes even in fummer, with fur ; and as if all this was not fufll- cient, they have an outer covering called the beniche, which is the cloak or robe of ceremony ; and fo com¬ pletely covers the body, that even the ends of the fingers are not to be feen. Thus, when the beniche and other accoutrements are on, the whole body appears like a long fack, with a bare neck and bald head covered «ith a turban thruft out of it. This turban is called v""- a kaouk; and is of a cylindrical form, yellow, and turned up on the outfide with a roll of muflin artifici¬ ally folded up. On their feet they have a fuck of yel¬ low leather reaching up to the heeb, flippers without any quarters, which confequently are always ready to be left oehind in walking. Laftly, to complete this extra¬ ordinary drefs, they have a kind of pantaloon or trore¬ fers, long enough to reach up to the chin, and fo large that each of the legs is big enough to contain the,whole body •, but that they may walk more at their eafe un¬ der fuch a number of impediments, they tie all the loofe parts of their drefs with a running fafti. “ Thus Twaddled (fays M. Volney), we may imagine the Mam¬ louks are not very a6tive walkers ; and thofe who are not acquainted by experience with the prejudices of dif¬ ferent countries, will find it fcarcely poffible to believe that they look on this drefs as exceedingly commodi¬ ous. In vain we may objeft that it hinders them from walking and encumbers them unneceffarily on horfe¬ back ; and that in battle a horfeman once difmounted is a lort man. They reply, It is the cujlom, and. every objection is anfwered.” In the accoutrements of their horfes, the Mamlouks are almoft equally abfurd. The faddle is a clumfy piece of furniture, weighing with the faddle-cloths not lefs than 25 pounds ; while the weight of the ftirrups is never lefs than 9 or 10 pounds, nay, frequently ex¬ ceeds 13. On the back part of the iaddle rifes a truf- fequin about eight inches in height, while a pummel before proje&s four or five inches, in fuch a manner as to endanger the breaft of the horfeman if he fhould happen to ftoop. Inftead of a ftufted frame, they have three thick woollen coverings below the faddle ; the whole being faftened by a furcingle, which, inftead of a buckle, is tied with leather thongs in very compli¬ cated knots, and liable to flip. Inftead of a crupper they have a large martingale which throws them upon the horfes ffioulders. The ftirrups are made of copper, longer and wider than the foot, having circular edges an inch high in the middle, and gradually declining to¬ ward each end. The edges are (harp, and ufed inftead of fpurs, by which means the poor animal’s fides are much wounded. 1 he weight of the furniture has al¬ ready been mentioned ; and is the more ridiculous as the Egyptian horfes are very fmall. The bridle is equally ill contrived, and greatly injures tie horfe’s mouth, efpecially by reafon cf the violent method they have of managing the animal. Their ufual way is to put the horfe to a full gallop, and fuddenly flop him when at full fpeed. Thus checked by the bit, he bends in his hind legs, ttiffens the fore ones, and moves along as if he fcarce had joints in his body: yet, notwithftand- ing all thofe difadvantages, our author acknowledges that they are vigorous horfemen, having a martial ap¬ pearance which pleafes even ftrangers",Aleppo,"SY,IN,EG",5,"Syrian Arab Republic,India,Egypt","Asia,Asia,Africa"
"In their engagements they have neither order, difci- pline, nor even fubordination ; fo that their wars are only fcenes of robbery, plunder, add. tumultuary en¬ counters, which begin very often fuddenly in the fireets of Cairo without the leaft warning. If the contention happens to be transferred to the country, it is ftill car¬ ried on in the fame manner. The ftrongeft or moft daring party purfues the other. If they are equal in courage, they will perhaps appoint a field of battle, and that without the leaft regard to the advantages of fituation, but fighting in platoons, with the boldeit champions at the head of each. After mutual defian¬ ces, the attack begins, and every one ehoofes out his man. After difcharging their fire-arms, if they have an opportunity they attack with their fabres *, and fuch as happen to be difmounted are helped up again by their fervants *, but if nobody happens to be near, the fervants will frequently kill them for the fake of the money they carry about them.

The fouth wind, he fays, cannot be the caufey otherwife the Be¬ douins would be equally fubjtdt to it with the Egyp¬ tians themfelves : but what is with the greateft proba¬ bility to be affignt'd as the caufe, according to our au¬ thor, is the very poor and little nutritive food which the natives are obliged to ufe. The cheefe, four- milk, honey, confeftion of grapes, green fruits, and raw vegetables (fays he), which are the ordinary food of the people,, produce in the ftomach a diforder which phyficians have obferved to afftft the fight; the raw onions, efpecially, which they devour in great quan¬ tities, have a peculiar heating quality, as the monks of Syria made me remark on myfelf. Bodies thus nourithed, abound in corrupted humours, which are conftantly endeavouring a difeharge. Diverted from the ordinary channels, by habitual perfpiration, thefe hu¬ mours fly to the exterior parts, and fix themfclves where they find the leaft refiftance. 'They therefore naturally attack the head, becaufe the Egyptians, by (having it once a-week, and covering it with a prodigioufly hot head-drefs, principally attraff to it the perfpiration j and if the head receives ever fo flight an impreffion of cold on being uncovered, this perfpiration is fupprefs- ed, and falls upon the teeth, or flill more readily on the eyes as being the tendereft part. It will appear the more probable that the exceffive perfpiration of the head is a principal caufe, when wre reflect that the an¬ cient Egyptians, who went bare-headed, are not men¬ tioned by phyficians as being fo much afflifted with ophthalmies ; though we are informed by hiftorians that fome of the Pharaohs died blind. The Arabs of the defert alfo, who cover the head but little, elpe- cially when young, are alfo very little fubjeft to them.” In this country blindnefs is often the confequence of the fmall-pox, a diforder very frequent and very fatal among E G Y > [63 among the Egyptians and no doubt the more dange¬ rous on account of their abfurd method of treating it, of which it is needlefs to enter into any difcuflion in this place.

He and his coadjutor tried to give polarity to needles made of watch fprings from three to fix inches in length, and like wife to fteel bars nine inches long, from a quarter of an inch to half an inch broad, and about a line in thicknefs. The refult was, that when the bar or needle was placed horizontally in the magnetic meridian, whichever way the (hock entered,, the end of the bar that flood toward the north acquired the north polarity, or the power of turning towards the north when freely fufpended, and the oppofite end ac¬ quired the fouth. It the bar, before it received the fhock, had fome polarity, and was placed with its poles contrary to the ufual direction, then its natural polarity \j’as always dimir.iflsed, and often reverfed; fo that the extremity of it, which in receiving the fhock look¬ ed towards the north, became the north pole, &c",Van,TR,5,Turkey,Asia

Between the particles of this fluid there fubfifts a very ftrong repulfion with regard to each other, and as ftrong an attradlion with regard to other matter. Thus, according to Dr Franklin’s hy- pothefis, one quantity of eleftric matter will repel ano¬ ther quantity of the fame, but will attradl and be at¬ tracted by any terreftrial matter that happens to be near it. The pores of all bodies are fuppofed to be lull of this fubtile fluid ; and when its equilibiium is not efif- turbed, that is, when there is in any body neither more nor lefs than its natural (hare, or than that quantity ■which it is capable of retaining by its own attraction, the fluid does not maniteft itfelf to our fenfes. The ac¬ tion of the rubber upon an eleChic-diiturbs this equili¬ brium, occafioning a deficiency of the fluid in one place, and a redundancy of it in another. This equilibrium being forcibly ditturbed, the mutual repulfion of the particles of the fluid is neceffarily exerted to reftore it",Of,TR,5,Turkey,Asia

Let this be covered with a tin or copper vef- fel in the form of a funnel, to prevent its ever being wetted. Above this let there rife a long ftender rod, terminating in a pointed wire, and having a fmall wire twifted round its whole length, to conduct the electri¬ city the better to the funnel. From the funnel make a wire defcend along the building, about a foot diftance from it, and be conducted through an open fafti, into any room which ftiall be moft convenient for making the experiments. In this room let a proper conductor be infulated, and connected with the wire coming in at the window.
