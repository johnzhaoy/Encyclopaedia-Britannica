"C FESIBIUS, a mathematician of Alexandria, a- bout I 20 years before Chrift. He was the firft who invented the pump. He alfo invented a clepfydra, or water-clock. This invention of meafuring time by water was wonderful and ingenious. Water was let drop upon wheels which it turned : the wheels com¬ municated their regular motion to a fmall wooden image, which by a gradual rife pointed with a ftick to the proper hours and minutes, -which were engraven on a column near the machine. This ingenious invention gave rife to many improvements ; and the modern method of meafuring time with an hour-glafs is in imitation of the clepfydra of Ctefibius",Alexandria,US,5,United States,North America

It lies 60 miles to the weft of Hifpaniola, 25 leagues north of Jamaica, 100 miles to the eaft of Ju- catanj and as many to the fouth of Cape Florida ; and commands the entrance of the gulfs both of Mexi¬ co and Florida, as alfo the Avindward paffages. By this fituation it may be called the key of the Weft In¬ dies. It Avas difcovcred by Columbus in T492, who gave it the name of Ferdinando, in honour of King Ferdinand of Spain ; but it quickly after recovered its ancient name of Cuba. The natives did not regard Columbus with a \rery favourable eye at his landing ; and the weather proving very tempeftuous, he foon * left this ifiand, and failed to Hayti, noAv called Hifpa¬ niola, Aihere he Avas better received. The Spaniards, however, foon became mafters of it. By the year 1511 it was totally conquered ; and in that time they had deftroyed, according to their own accounts, feve¬ ral millions of people. But the poffeflion of Cuba was far from anfwering the expectations of the Spanifii adventurers, whofe avarice could be fatiated Avith nothing but gold. Thefe monfters, finding that there Avas gold upon the illand, concluded that it muft come from mines; and therefore tortured the few inhabi¬ tants they had left, in order to extort from tl a dif- covery of the places were thefe mines lay. ihe mi- feries endured by thefe poor creatures were fuch that they almoft unanimoufly refdlved to put an end to their own lives ; but were prevented by one of the Spanilh’ tyrants called Vafco Povccllos. This Avretch threaten¬ ed to hang himfelf along Avith them, that he might have the pleafure, as he faid, of tormenting them in the next Avorkl worfe than he had done in this; and fo much were they afraid of the Spaniards, that this A threat CUB [2 Cuba, threat diverted thefe poor favages from their defperate 1 _ refolution. In 1511, the town of Havannah was built, now the principal place on the illand.

"According to the Abbe Raynal, the Spaniffi fettle- ment at Cuba is very important, on three accounts j j. The produce of the country, which is confiderable",,CU,5,Cuba,North America
"This cultivation of coffee naturally leads to that of fugar ; and this, which is the moft valuable produc¬ tion of America, would of itfelf be fufficient to give Cuba that ftate of profperity for which it feems de- figned by nature. Although the furface of the illand is in general uneven and mountainous, yet it has plains fufficiently extenfive, and well enough watered, to fup- ply the confumption of the greateft part of Europe with fugar. The incredible fertility of its new lands, if properly managed, w ould enable it to furpafs every other nation, however they may have now got the Hart of it : yet fueh is the indolence of the Spaniards, that to this day they have but few plantations, where,, with the fineft canes, they make but a fmall quantity • of coarfe fugar at a great expence. This ferves partly for the Mexican market, and partly for the mother- country j while the indolent inhabitants are content to import fugar for themfelves at the expence of near 220,cocl. annually. It has been expedted with pro¬ bability, that the tobacco imported from Cuba w ould compenfate this lofs; for after furnilhing Mexico and Peru, there was fufficient, with the little brought from Caracca and Buenos Ayres, to fupply all Spain. But this trade too has declined through the negligence of the court of Madrid, in not gratifying the general tafte for tobacco from the Havannah. The Spaniffi colonies have an univerfal trade in fkins ; and Cuba iiipplies ymually about 10 or 12 thoufand. The num¬ ber might eaftly be increafed in a country abounding with wild cattle, where feme gentlemen poffefs large trafts of ground, that for want of population can fcarce be applied to any other purpofe than that of breeding cattle. The hundredth part of this Bland is not yet cleared. The true plantations are all confined to the beautiful plains of the Havannah, and even thofe are not what they might be. AH thefe plantations ] CUB together may employ about 25,000 male and female Cuba flaves. The number of whites, meftees, mulattoes, l! and free negroes, upon the whole ifland, amounts to ,<""u^c'!(‘cr~j about 30,000.

If any thing could lupply the want of an open trade, and a- tone for the grievances occafioned by this monopoly at Cuba, it would be the advantage which this illand has for fuch a long time enjoyed, in being the rendezvous of almoft all the Spaniih veffels that fail to the new world.

In this difpatch, which is dated Auguft the 4th, 1514, and is ratified with the feal of the golden bull, Maximilian addreffts Vaffili by calling him Kayfer and Herrfcher aller Rujfen, “ emperor and ruler of all the Ruffias.” But independently of this document, there could be no doubt that the foreign courts, in their intercourfe with that of Mofcow, ftyled the fove- reigns indilcriminately Great Duke, Czar, and Em¬ peror. With refpeft to England in particular, it is certain that in Chancellor’s Account of Ruffia, fo early as the middle of the 16th century, Ivan Vaffilie- vitch II. is called Lord and Emperor of all Ruf/ia ; and in the Englith difpatches, from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Anne, he is generally addreffed under the fame appellation.

When Peter, therefore, determined to affume the title of em¬ peror, he found no difficulty in proving that it had been conferred upon his predeceffors by moft of the European powers j yet when he was delirous of affix¬ ing to the term the European fenfe, it was confidered as an innovation, and was produftive of more negotia¬ tions than would have been requifite for the termina¬ tion of the moft important ftate affair. At the fame time it occafioned a curious controverfy among the learned, concerning the rife and pmgrefs of the titles by which the monarchs of this country have been di- ftinguiffied.

He fays, “ the firft inhabitants of the ifiand of Crete were the Da£lyli Idcei, who had their refi- dence on Mount Ida : that fome faid they were an hundred j others only five in number, equal to the fin¬ gers of a man’s hand, whence they had the name of DaByli: that they were magicians, and addicted to myftical ceremonies : that Orpheus was their difciple, and carried their mylleries into Greece: that the Dac- tyli invented the ufe of iron and fire, and that they had been recompenfed with divine honours.” Diomedes the grammarian fays, the Dadtyli Idgei Were priefts of the goddefs Cybele : called Idcei, be¬ caufe that goddefs was chiefly worlhipped on Mount Ida in Phrygia; and DaBy/i, ‘becaufe that, to prevent Saturn from hearing the cries of infant Jupiter, whom Cybele had committed to their cullody, they ufed to fing certain verfes of their own invention, in the Dac- Daflyli tylic meafure.

"Although his lordlhip’s conftitution had been long in an enfeebled Hate, he attended his duty on the bench till within three days of his death, which happened on the 29th of November 1792, in the 66th year of his age.

Though our church does not encourage funeral difcourfes in gene¬ ral, becaufe they are liable to much abufe, a very laudable endeavour was made, in thefe degenerate times, to render his lordlhip’s pre-eminent talents and virtues a theme of inllruiSlion to mankind, in a fermon preached, foon after his death, in the church of In- verelk, by his learned friend, and venerable pallor, Dr Carlyle ; from which we lhall tranfcribe a fum- mary view of his chara£ler as a judge, a fcholar, a Chriltian, and a citizen. “ His knowledge of the laws was accurate and profound, and he applied it in judgment with the moll fcrupulous integrity.

Omnifcient Judge, infpired him, on fome occafions, with a commanding fublimity of thought, and a feeling folemnity of exprellion, that made condemnation feem juft, as the doom of Providence, to the criminals themfelves, and railed a falutary horror of crimes in the breafts of the audience. Confcious of the dignity and importance of the high office he held, he never departed from the decorum that becomes that reverend charadler; which indeed it coll him no effort to fup- port, becaufe he a£ted from principle and fentiment, both public and private. Affeflionate to his family and relations, fimple and mild in his manners, pure and confcientious in his morals, enlightened and entertain¬ ing in his converfation 5 he left fociety only to regret, that, devoted as he was to more important employ¬ ments, 5he had lb little time to fpare for intercourfe with them. He was well known to be of high rank In the republic of letters, and his lofs will be deeply felt through many of her departments.

It increafed in importance every day, in proportion as Pelufium, which was frequently plun¬ dered, loll its power. The total ruin of that ancient town occafioned the commerce of the eaftern parts of the Delta to be transferred to Damietta. It was, how¬ ever, no longer a place of ftrength, when, towards the year 238 of the Hegira, the emperors of Conftantino- ple took poffeffion of it a fecond time.

In his courfes there, he became acquainted with Captain Dampier and Mr Wafer, who afterwards publilhed, the one his Voyages, and the other his T ravels, in the region where the fe- paration is narrowed between the Atlantic and the South feas ; and both of whom, particularly the fird, appear by their books to have been men of confider- able obfervation. But he got much more knowledge from men who could neither write nor read, by culti¬ vating the acquaintance of fome of the old bucaniers, Vfeo, after furviving their glories and their crimes, dill, in the extremity of age and misfortune, recounted with tranfport the eafe with which they had paffed and repaffed from the one fea to the other, fometimes in hundreds together, and driving drings of mules before them loaded with the plunder of friends and of foes","Of, Darien","IE,TR,US",5,"Ireland,Turkey,United States","Europe,Asia,North America"
"Paterfon having examined the places, fatisfied himfelf, that on the idhmus of Darien there was a traft of country running acrofs from the Atlantic to the South *ea, which the opaniards had never poffelled, and in¬ habited by a people continually at war with them ; that along the coad, on the Atlantic fide, there lay a firing of iflands called the Sambaloes, uninhabited, and full of natural drength and foreds, from which lad circumdance one of them was called the ijland of the Pines ; that the feas there were filled with turtle and the manatee or fea cow ; that mid-way between Porto- Bello and Carthagena, but near 50 leagues didant from either, at a place called Affia, in the mouth of the Darien, there was a natural harbour, capable of recei¬ ving the greated fleets, and defended from dorms by other iflands which covered the mouth of it, and from enemies by a promontory which commanded the paf- fage, and by hidden rocks in the palTage itfelf; that on the other fide of the iflhmus, and in ’the fame traft of country, there were natural harbours, equally capa¬ cious and well defended ; that the two Teas were con- nefted by a ridge of hills, which, by their height, created a temperate climate in the midd of the moft fultry latitudes, and were Iheltered by foreds, yet not rendered damp by them, becaufe the trees grew at a didance from each other, having very little under¬ wood j that, contrary to the barren nature of hilly ^countries, the foil was of a black mould two or three 88 ] D A R feet deep, and producing fpontaneoufly the fine tropi¬ cal fruits and plants, and roots and herbs ; that roads could be made with eafe along the ridge, by which mules, and even carriages, might pafs from the one fta to the other in the fpace of a day ; and confequent- ly this paflage feemed to be pointed out by the finger of nature, as a common centre, to conneft together the trade and intercourfe of the uhiverfe","Darien, Bello, Darien","US,CO",5,"United States,Colombia","North America,South America"
"Paterfon knew that fhips which ftretch in a draight line from one point to another, and with one wind, run little rilks, and require fewer hands, than fliips which pafs through many latitudes, turn with many coafls, and require many winds j in evidence of which, veflels of feven or eight hundred tons burden are often to be found in the South feas, navigated by no more than eight or ten hands, becaufe thefe hands have little elfe to do than fet their fails when they begin their voyage, and to take them in when they end it; that as foon as (hips from Britain got fo far fouth as to reach the trade-wind, which feldom varies, that wind would carry them to Darien, and the fame wind would carry fliips from the bay of Panama, on the op- pofite fide of the idhmus, to the Ead Indies ; that as foon as fliips coming from the Ead Indies to the bay of Panama got fo far north as the latitude of 40°, to reach the wederly winds, which, about that latitude, blow almofl as regularly from the wed as the trade- winds do from the eafi, thefe winds would carry them, in the track of the Spanilh Acapulco fliips, to the coafl of Mexico ; from whence the land-wind, which blows for ever from the north to the fouth, would car¬ ry them along the coad of Mexico into the bay of Pa¬ nama. So that in going from Britain, ftiips would encounter no uncertain winds, except during their paf- fage fouth into the latitude of the trade-wind : in co¬ ming from India to the bay of Panama, no uncertain winds, except in their palfage north to the latitude of the weflerly winds j and in going from the other fide of the idhmus to the ead, no uncertain wind whatfoever",Darien,"PA,MX,IN,US",5,"Panama,Mexico,India,United States","North America,North America,Asia,North America"
"■—Gold was feen by Paterfon in fome places of the idhmus ; and hence an ifland on the Atlantic fide was called the Golden if and, and a river on the fide to the South fea was called the Golden river ; but thefe were objefts which he regarded not at that time, becaufe far greater were in his eye ; the removing of didances, the drawing nations nearer to each other, the prefervation of the valuable lives of feamen, and the faving in freight, fo important to merchants, and in time fo im¬ portant to them, and to an animal whofe life is of fo ftiort duration as that of man","Golden, Golden",US,5,United States,North America
"By this obfcUre Scotfman, a projefl was formed to fettle, on this negle&ed fpot, a great and powerful co¬ lony ; not as other colonies have for the mod part been fettled, by chance, and unprotected by the coun¬ try from whence they went ; but by fyflem, upon fore¬ fight, and to receive the ample protection of thofe go¬ vernments to whom he was to offer his projeCt.

But that happened to him which has happened to many in his fituation : the perfons to whom he applied made ufe of his ideas, took the honour of them to themfelves, were civil to him for a while, and negle&ed him after¬ wards. He therefore communicated his projedl of a co¬ lony only to a few perfons in London, and thefe few difcouraged him","Darien, London, London","GB,US",5,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"
"He next made offer of his projedl to the Dutch, the Hamburghers, and the eledtor of Brandenburgh j becaufe, by means of the paffage of the Rhine and Elbe, through their dates, he thought, that the great addi¬ tional quantities of Eaft Indian and American goods, which his colony would bring into Europe, would be diftributed through Germany. The Dutch and Ham¬ burgh merchants, who had moft intereft: in the fubjedl of his vifit, heard him with indift'erence: The eledtor, who had very little intereft in it, received him with honour and kindnefs. But court arts and falfe reports loft him even that prince’s favour",,"DE,NL,US",5,"Germany,Netherlands,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Fletcher brought Paterfon down to Scotland with him, prefented him to the marquis ofTweeddale, then mi- nifter for Scotland ; and then, with that power, which a vehement fpirit always poffeffes over a diffident one, perfuaded the marquis, by arguments of public good and the honour which wrould redound to his admini- ftration, to adopt the project. ^ Lord Stair and Mr Johnfton, the two fecretaries of ftate, patronifed thofe abilities in Paterfon which they poffeffed in themfelves: and the lord advocate, Sir James Stuart, the fame man who had adjufted the prince of Grangers declara¬ tion at the Revolution, whofe fon was married to a niece of Lord Stair, went naturally along with his con¬ nexions. Thefe perfons, in June 1695, procured a ffatute from parliament, and aftenvards a charter from the crown in terms of it, for creating a trading compa¬ ny to Africa and the new world, with power to plant colonies and build forts, with confent of the inhabi¬ tants, in places not poffeffed by other European na¬ tions",Stuart,US,5,United States,North America

"In the mean time the jealoufy of trade (continues our author), which has done more mifchief to the trade of England than all other caufes put together, created an alarm in England j and the houfes of lords and com¬ mons, without previous inquiry or reflexion, on the 13th of December 1695, concurred in a joint addrefs to the king, againft: the eftabliftiment of the Darien com¬ pany as detrimental to the intereft of the Eaft India Company. Soon after, the commons impeached fome of their own countrymen for being inftrumental in erefting the company j and alfo fome of the Scots na¬ tion, one of whom was a peer, Lord Belhaven ; that is to fay, they arraigned the fubjefts of another country, for making ufe of the laws of their own. Among 600 legiflators, not one had the happy ray of genius to pro- pofe a committee of both parliaments, to inquire into the principles and confequences of the eftabliftiment 5 and it thefe. thould, upon inquiry, be found, that -the benefit of it ftiould be communicated, by a participa¬ tion of rights, to both nations. 1 he king’s anfvver was, “ That he had been ill advifed in Scotland.” Fie foon after changed his Scottifti minifters, and fent Or¬ ders to his refident at Hamburgh to prefent a memorial to the fenate, in which he difowned the company, and warned them againft all connexions with it. The fe¬ nate fent the memorial to the affembly of merchants, who returned it with the following fpirited anfwer: “ We look upon it as a very ftrange thing, that the king of Britain ffiould offer to hinder us, who are a free people, to trade with whom we pleafe; but are amazed to think that he would hinder us from joining with his own fubjedfts in Scotland, to whom he had lately given fuch large privileges, by fo folemn an a£I of parlia¬ ment.” But the merchants feeing the fcheme difcou¬ raged by their governments were foon intimidated : The Dutch, Hamburgh, and London merchants with¬ drew their fubfcriptions","Darien, London","US,GB",5,"United States,United Kingdom","North America,Europe"
"The Scots, not difcouraged, xvere rather animated by this oppreffion ; for they converted it into a proof of the envy of the Engliffi, and of their confcioufnefs of the great advantages which were to flow to Scotland ' from the colony. The company proceeded to build fix (hips in Holland, from 36 to 60 guns, and they en¬ gaged 1200 men for the colony ; among whom were younger fons of many of the noble and moft ancient families of Scotland, and 60 officers who had been dif- banded at the peace, who carried with them fuch of M their D A R [ 90 ] BAR D uien. tli«ir private men, generally raifed on their own, or the  eftates of their relations, as they knew to be faithful and brave j and mod of thofe were Highlanders.

Twelve hundred men failed in five flout (hips, and arrived at Darien in two months, with the lofs of only 15 of their people. At that time it was in their power, moft of whom were well born, and all of them hardily bred and inured to the fatigues and dangers of the late war, to have gone from the northmoft part of Mexico to the fouthmoft of Chili, and to have overturned the whole empire of Spain in the South feas: But modefl, re- fpefling their own and their country’s character, and afraid of being accufed that they had plunder, and not a fettlement in view, they began with purchafing lands from the natives, and fending meffages of amity to the Spanith governors wdthin their reach : and then fixed their ftation at A£!a, calling it New St Andrew^ from the name of the tutelar faint of Scotland, and the country itfelf New Caledonia.

An obfervant eye might fee, that they were running the way they went ; hell and judgment was to be feen upon them, and in them, before the time: Their cup was full ; it could hold no more : They were ripe 5 they muft be cut down with the fickle of the wrath of God.” The laft party that joined the fecond colony at Da¬ rien, after it had been three months fettled, was Cap¬ tain Campbell of Finab with a company of the people of ' his own eftate, whom he had commanded in Flanders, and whom he carried to Darien in his own (hip. On their arrival at New St Andrew, they found intelligence had been lately received, that a Spunilh force of 1600 men, which had been brought from the coaft of the South fea, lay encamped at Tubucantee, waiting there till a Spaniflr fquadron of eleven (hips which was expeCled {hould arrive, when they were jointly to attack the fort.

"As to what effe<ff deformity may have on the health, it appears natural to imagine, that as the inward parts of the body muft in fome meafure comply with the outward mould, fo the form of the -latter being irregu¬ lar, the firft cannot be lo well placed and difpofed to perform their functions; and that generally deformed perfons would not be healthy or long-lived. But this is a queftion belt determined by fa&s ; and in this cafe the inftances are too few or unobferved, to draw a ge¬ neral conclufion from them : and health is more than is commonly thought in a man’s own power, and the reward of temperance more than the effba of conftitu- tion ; which makes it more difficult to pafs a judg¬ ment. iEfop could not be young when he died ; and might have lived longer if he had not been murdered at Delphi. The prince of Orange fcarce paffed the meridian of life, and the duke of Luxemburg died about the age of 6y. The lord treafurer Burleigh lived toyS* but his fon the earl of Saliffiury, who died about i 5 years after him, could not reach near that age. It is faid that Mr Pope’s father was deformed, and he lived to y5 whereas the fon died in middle age, if he may be faid to die whofe works are immortal",Orange,US,5,United States,North America
"Another great prefervative of health is moderate ex- ercife, which few deformed perfons can want ftrtngth to perform. As a deformed perfon is not for hied for violent exercife, he is lefs liable to fuch diforders as are the natural confequences of it. He will alfo efcape many accidents, to which men of athletic make, and who glory in their ftrength, are always expofing them- felves to make trial and proof of it. If he cannot carry an ox, like Milo, he will not like Milo be hand¬ cuffed in the oak by attempting to rend it. He will not be the man that ffiall ride from London to York in a day. or to Windfor in an hour, for a wager j or that ftiall be perpetually performing furprifing long journeys in a furprifing ffiort time, for no earthly bu- finefs but the pleafure of relating them. Conlcious of his own weaknefs, he will be cautious of running into places or occafions of danger. Nature, too, warns de¬ formed perfons to be careful not to offer fuch affronts as may call them forth into the field of falfe honour, where they cannot acquit themfelves well for want of ftrength and agility ; and they are fecurer from fuch affronts themfelves, fince others will confider the little credit they will gain by compelling them to appear on that fcene. On the whole, therefore, it may be con¬ cluded, that deformity is a protedion to a man’s health and perfon ; which (ftrange as it may appear) are bet¬ ter defended by feeblenefs than ftrength","London, York","GB,US",5,"United Kingdom,United States","Europe,North America"

"Another great advantage of deformity is, that it tends to the improvement of the mind. A man that cannot fhine in his perfon, will have recourfe to his un- derftanding j and attempt to adorn that part of him, which alone is capable of ornament. When his am¬ bition prompts him to begin, with Cowley, to afk him- felf this queftion, What (hall I do to be for ever known, And make the age to come my own ?— on looking about him, he will find many avenues to the temple of fame barred againfl: him ; but fome are ftill open through that of virtue ; and thofe, if he has a right ambition, he will moft probably attempt to pafs.

And though the ftory is told with fome variation, yet in all the circumftances of confequence it accords very happily with the mythology of Egypt, Syria, and Greece.

"Even America would contribute to this purpofe. The more rude the monuments, the more ancient they may poffibly prove, and afford a greater light upon in- 20 quirv.” American The accounts hitherto met with in this continent, accounts of indeed, are far from being equally authentic and fatis- the deluge, fa&ory with thofe hitherto treated of. In Acofla’s hiftory of the Indies, however, we are informed, that the Mexicans make particular mention of a deluge in their country, by which oil men were drowned. Ac¬ cording to them, one Viracocha came out of the great lake Titicaca in their country. This perfon ftaid in Tiaguanaco, where at this day are to be feen the ruins of fome ancient and very ftrange buildings. From thence he came to Cufco, where mankind began to multiply. They fhew alfo a fmall lake, where they fay the fun hid himfelf: for which reafon they facri- fice largely to him, both men and other animals.  Hennepin informs us, that fome of the favages are of opinion, that a certain fpirit, called Otkon by the Iro¬ quois, and Atahauta by thofe at the mouth of the ri¬ ver St Lawrence, is the creator of the world ; that Mejfou repaired it after the deluge. They fay, that this Meffou or Otkon, being a-hunting one day, his dogs loft themfelves in a great lake, which thereupon overflowing, covered the whole earth in a fhort time, and fwallowed up the Avorld. According to Herrera, the people of Cuba knew that the heavens and the earth had been created ; and faid they had much in¬ formation concerning the flood ; and that the world had been deftroyed by water, by three perfons, who came three feveral ways.

With regard to the main difliculty, vk. how the animal? peculiar to different countries could travel to fuch diftances to and from the ark, Mr Cockburn re¬ plies, that America, which Bifliop Stillingfleet chiefly infifts upon, has nothing peculiar to it, but what may equally well be urged both with refpeft to Afia and Africa ; each of them having animals peculiar to them¬ felves.

This argument, however, feems to be very inconclufive ; for though we (hould fuppofe the ark to have been eonftru&ed in America itfelf, the animals of Mefopo- Deluge, 2 ] DEL tamia would have had as far to travel from thence to America, as the American animals from their own country to Mefopotamia, according to the common ' opinion. But in whatever part of the earth Noah lived and the ark was built, it was at God’s command that the feveral kinds of animals came hither in order to their prefervation ; and his command could bring them irotn the fartheft parts of the earth during the 120 years that all the world lay under condemnation",,US,5,United States,North America
"4. There is a moral reafon why the earth after the flood fhould be lefs fertile, than before. The luxu¬ riant productions of the firft earth, after man’s nature became corrupted, and to deviate more and more from righteoufnefs, ferved only to excite and foment his lulls, and to minifter plentiful fuel to his vices and luxury. To cut off, therefore, fuch occafion of fin and wickednefs, God, in great mercy to men, retrench¬ ed the earth in its former fertility, thereby obliging them to labour and diligence, and employing moft of their time to procure their neceffary fubfiftence, which the earth by diligent culture will Hill afford, but not that luxuriant abundance it did before the flood. If we take a furvey of the different regions and countries of the world, we (hall find this to be the truth of the cafe. Some places, both in Afia and America, are as it were a paradife in refpeft of the reft, to fhow us perhaps what was and would have been the ftate of the earth had not man finned; but far the greateft part is nothing to be compared to thefe, and evidently (hows that effeCl which the fins of men had upon the earth itfelf. In a word, if we take a furvey of the whole, it cannot be thought that the firft bleffing was reftored to the earth after the flood, or that it came out of the hands of its Maker, in the ftate it is at pre- fent, fince fo great a part of it bears ftill the marks of the curfe laid upon it.” Notwithftanding all that is here alleged, the extra¬ ordinary fertility of the ancient earth muft ftill ap¬ pear very problematical, if we confider all circumftan- ees. For, 1. Even at the creation, when the earth was at its fctinoft perfection, we cannot. fuppofe that every part I of it produced fpontaneoufly like the garden of Eden, On the contrary, we are told that this garden was planted by the Lord God, and that Adam was put into it to drefs it and keep it. It appears, therefore, that even in the Paradifaical ftate the earth would not have produced food for man without culture ; for as God planted the firft garden, there can be no doubt that had man continued in his ftate of innocence and mul¬ tiplied, he muft have planted other gardens when it be¬ came neceffary. After the fall, the fertility of the earth was exprefsly removed, and that not in a flight degree ; but if we can judge from the prefent ftate of things, it muft have become extremely wild and bar¬ ren. Thus, when it is faid, “ Thorns alfo and tbiftles fhall it bring forth to thee we may judge of the ftate of the foil from that which we fee bringing forth thorns and thiftles at this day. Every one knows that an abundant crop of thefe weeds indicates poor ground, which will require a great deal of cultivation to bring it into order. Nay, that we may be fure that the cul¬ tivation of the earth was at this time no eafy matter, it is likewife faid, “ In forrow fhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.” Kence it would appear, that the antediluvian earth, inftead of being more fertile, was much more barren than at prefent. That the la¬ bour of cultivating the ground at that time was alfo fo great as to be almoft intolerable, is evident from the fpeech of Lamech on the birth of Noah : “ This fame (fays he) fliall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, concerning the ground which the Lord hath curfed.” 2. There is a very evident natural reafon why the antediluvian world fhould have been more barren than the prefent, and why the deluge fhould have removed that barrennefs. Under the article ANTEDILUVIANS, N° 19. it is hinted, that the purity of the air at that time was a principal caufe of the longevity of the hu¬ man race. If this was really the cafe, which is very probable, we muft fuppofe the atmofphere to have then contained a greater quantity of pure air than it does at prefent; for experiments have put it beyond doubt, that from this the fupport of animal life is im¬ mediately derived. But this kind of air, however fa¬ vourable to animal life, is found to be very unfavour¬ able to vegetation ; and therefore in proportion to its abundance in the antediluvian atmofphere, the animals will be healthy, and the vegetables weak, puny, and fiekly. But the deluge, by overflowing the earth for a whole year, deftroyed every animal and vegetable, and confequently induced a vaft putrefa&ion all over the globe; the eonfequence of which was the produc¬ tion of an immenfe quantity of what is calledphlogifti- catedair {evzotic gas). This mixing with the pure atmo¬ fphere, vitiated it to fuch a degree as to make it lefs friendly to animal life, but more fo to vegetation",Eden,US,5,United States,North America

Some of Cicero’s dialogues have only two, others, three or more, and thofe concerning an orator feven.

The dictator remained in office for fix months, after which he was again ele£led if the affairs of the ftate feemed to be defperate $ but if tranquillity was re-eftabliffied, he generally laid down his power before the time was expired. He knew no fuperior in the republic, and even the laws were fub- je£ted to him. He was called didlator, becaufe di£lust named by the conful, or quoniam diclis ejus patebat po~ pulus, becaufe the people implicitly obeyed his com¬ mand. He was named by the conful in the night viva voce, and his eledtion was confirmed by the au¬ gurs. As his power was abfolute, he could proclaim war, levy forces, condudl them againft an enemy, and diffiand them at his pleafure. He puniffied as he pleafed, and from his decifion there lay no appeal, at leaft till latter times. He was preceded by 24 lidlors with the fafees ; during his adminiftration, all other officers, ex¬ cept the tribunes of the people, were fufpended, and 22 ] DIG he was the mafter of the republic.

He was cho¬ fen only when the ftate was in imminent danger from foreign enemies or inward feditions. In the time of a peftilence, a didlator was fometimes eledled, as alfo to hold the comitia or to celebrate the public feftivals, or drive a nail into the capitol, by which fuperftitious ceremony the Romans believed that a plague could be averted or the progrefs of an enemy flopped. This office, fo refpedtable and illuftrious in the firft ages of the republic, became odious by the perpetual ufurpa- tions of Sylla and Julius Cmiar 5 and after the death of the latter, the Roman fenate paffed a decree which for ever after forbade a didlator to exift in Rome.

"Bfimita- One very great defideratum among the diftillers of |:'??fore'8n this country is, a method of imitating the foreign fpi- pfrits. rits, brandy, rum, gin, &c. to a tolerable degree of perfection ; and notwithftanding the many attempts that are daily made for this purpofe, the fuccefs in ge¬ neral hath been very indifferent. On this fubjeCt, Mr Cooper has the following obfervations, in his Complete Syflem of Diftillation : which, as they are S applicable to all other fpirits as well as brandy, Ave Method of fhaii jiere tranfcribe.—“ The general method of diftil- Irandles in ^'in& ^ran(^'t’s France need not be formally defcribed, ■ranee. as it differs in nothing from that praCtifed here in working from malt, wafti, or molaffes ; nor are they in the leaft more cleanly or exaCt in the operation. They only obferve more particularly to throw in a little of the natural ley into the ft ill along with the wine, ns finding this gives their fpirit the flavour for which it is generally admired abroad.—But, though brandy is ex- trafled from wine, experience tells us, that there is a great difference in the grapes from which the wine is made. Every foil, every climate, every kind of graces, varies with regard to the quantity and quality of the fpirits extracted from them. There are fome grapes which are only fit for eating; others for drying, as thofe of Damafcus, Corinth, Provence, and Avignon, but not fit to make wine.— Some wines are very pro¬ per for diftillation, and others much lefs fo. The wines of Languedoc and Provence afford a great deal of brandy by diftillation, when the operation is per¬ formed on them in their full ftrength. The Orleans wines, and thofe of Blois, afford yet more ; but the beft are thofe of the territories of Cogniac and An- daye ; which are, however, in the number of thofe the leaft drunk in France. Whereas thofe of Burgundy and Champagne, though of a very fine flavour, are im¬ proper, becaufe they yield but very little in diftilla¬ tion","Corinth, Avignon, Blois","FR,US",5,"France,United States","Europe,North America"
"“ The fpirit diftilled from molaffes or treacle is very clean or pure. It is made from common treacle dif- folved in water, and fermented in the fame manner as the waih for the common malt fpirit. But if fome par¬ ticular art is not ufed in diftiliing this fpirit, it will not prove fo vinous as malt fpirit, but more flat and lefs pungent and acid, though otherwife much cleaner tailed, as its eflential oil is of a much lefs offenfive fla¬ vour. Therefore, if good frclh wine lees, abounding in tartar, be added and duly fermented with the mo- lafles, the fpirit will acquire a much greater vinofity and brilknefs, and approach much nearer to the nature of foreign fpirits. Where the molaffes fpirit is brought to the common proof ftrength, if it is found net to have a fufficient vinofity, it will be very proper to add fome good dulcified fpirit of nitre; and if the fpirit be clean worked, it may, by this addition onlv, be made to pafs on ordinary judges for French brandy. Great quanti¬ ties of this fpirit are ufed in adulterating foreign bran¬ dy, rum, and arrack. Much of it is alfo ufed alone in making cherry brandy and other drams by infufion ; in all which many, and perhaps with juftice, prefer it to foreign brandies. Molafies, like all other fpirits, is entirely colourlefs when firft extrafled ; but oilfillers always give it as nearly as pofiible the colour of foreign fpirits.” If thefe principles hold good, the imitation of fo¬ reign fpirits of all kinds mufi: be an eafy matter. It will only coft the procuring of fome of thofe fubftances from which the fpirit is draw.,; and diftiliing this with water, the effential oil will always give the flavour de- fired. Thus, to imitate Jamaica rum, it will only be neceffary to procure fome of the tops, or other ufelefs parts, of the fugar-canes ; from which an eflential oil being drawn, and mixed with clean molafles fpirit, will give it the true flavour. The principal difficulty mull lie in procuring a fpirit totally, or nearly free of all flavour of its own. The fpirit drawn from the refufe of a fugar-houfe is by our author commended as fupe- rior to that drawn from molafles : though even this is not entirely devoid of fome kind of flavour of its own ; nor indeed is that drawn from the bell refined fugar entirely flavourlefs. It is very probable, therefore, that to procure an abfolutely flavourlefs fpirit is impoffible",Much,"JM,DE,FR",5,"Jamaica,Germany,France","North America,Europe,Europe"

We read, however, that in the time of Ariftotle divers ufed a kind of kettle, to enable them to continue longer under the water j but the man¬ ner in which it was employed is not clearly deferi- bed. The oldeft information which we have of the ufe of the diving-bell in Europe, is that of John Taifnier, who was born in Hainault in 1509, and had a place at court under Charles V. whom he attended on his voyage to Africa. He relates in what man¬ ner he faw at Toledo, in the prefence of the emperor and feveral thoufand fpe&ators, two Greeks let them¬ felves down under water, in a large inverted kettle, with a burning light, and rife up again without being wet.

By a fubfcrip- tion, promoted chiefly by the ,duke of Albemarle, the fon of the celebrated Monk, Phipps was enabled, in 1687, to try his fortune once more, having previoufly engaged to divide the profit according to the twenty ftiares of which the fubfcription confifted. At firft all his labour proved fruitlefs ; but at laft, when his pa¬ tience was almoft entirely exhaufted, he was fo lucky as to bring up, from the depth of fix or feven fathoms, fo much treafure that he returned to England with the value of two hundred thoufand pounds fterling. Of this fuin he himfelf got about fixteen, others fay twenty thoufand, and the duke ninety thoufand pounds.

The extenfive grove which furrounded Jupiter’s temple was endowed with the gift of prophecy ; and oracles were frequent¬ ly delivered by the facred oaks and the doves which in¬ habited the place.

Where he was educated, is not known 5 but it is certain that he ftudied theology : a ftudy, however, which did not eftrange him from the mufes; for he employed himfelf at intervals in tranf- latin^ into beautiful verfe the poem of Ovid de Remedio Atnoris. The advantages of foreign travel, and the converfation of the molt learned men in France and Germany, to whom his merit produced the readieft ac- cefs, completed his education. With his fuperior re¬ commendations and worth, it was impofiible he could remain unnoticed. His firft preferment wa"" to be pro volt of the collegiate church of Si Giles in Edinburgh ; a place at that time of great dignity and revenue. In the year 1514, the queen mother, then regent of Scot¬ land, appointed Douglas abbot of Aberbrothock, and foon after archbilhop of St Andrew’s ; but the queen’s power not being fufficient to eltablilh him in the pof- feflion of that dignity, he relinquilhed his claim in fa¬ vour of his competitor Foreman, who was fupporte'd by the pope. In 1515, he was by the queen appoint¬ ed bifhop of Dunkeld and that appointment was foon after confirmed by his holinefs Leo X. Neverthelefs it was fume time before he could obtain peaceable pof- feffion of his fee. The duke of Albany, who in this year was declared regent, oppofed him becaufe he was fupported by the queen ; and, in order to deprive him of his bilhopric, accufed him of afting contrary to law in receiving bulls from Rome. On this accufation he was committed to the caftle of Edinburgh, where he continued in confinement above a year j but the re¬ gent and the queen being at lalt reconciled, he obtain¬ ed his liberty, and was confecrated bilhop of Dunkeld","Douglas, Edinburgh, Douglas, Albany, Rome, Edinburgh","US,GB,FR,DE",5,"United States,United Kingdom,France,Germany","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"

"Drake, Sir Francis, a celebrated Englifh admi¬ ral, was the fon of Edmund Drake, a failor, and born near Taviftock in Devonlhire, in the year 1545. He was brought up at the expence, and under the care of, Sir John Hawkins, who was his kinfman ; and, at the age of 18, was purfer of a (hip trading to Bifcay. At 20, he made a voyage to Guinea j and, at 22, had the honour to be made captain of the Judith. In that ca¬ pacity he was in the harbour of St John de Ulloa, in the gulf of Mexico, where he behaved mod gallantly in the glorious actions under Sir John Hawkins, and returned with him to England with great reputation, though not w#rth a groat. Upon this he projected a defign again!! the Spaniards in the Weft Indies 5 which he no fooner publiftied, than he had volunteers enough ready to accompany him. In 1570, he made his firft expedition with two (hips ; and the next year with only one, in which he returned fafe, if not with fuch advantages as he expected. He made another expedition in 1,572, wherein he did the Spaniards fome mifchief, and gained confiderable booties. In thefe expeditions he was much affifted by a nation of Indians, who then were, and have been ever fince, en¬ gaged in perpetual wars _with the Spaniards. The prince of thefe people was named Pedro; to whom Drake prefented a fine cUtlafs from his fide, which he faw the Indian greatly admired. Pedro, in return, gave him four large wedges of gold ; which Drake threw into the common dock, faying, That he thought it but juft that fuch as bore the charge of fo uncertain a voyage on his credit, (hould (hare the utmoft advan¬ tage that voyage produced.

"“ The head (fays M. de Piles) contributes more to the exprelfion of the paffions than all the other parts of the body put together. Thofe feparately can only fhow fome few palfions, but the head expreffes them all. Some, however, are more peculiarly exprelfed by it than others: as humility, by hanging it down ; ar¬ rogance, by lifting it up: languifhment, by inclining it to one fide j and obftinacy, when with a lliff and re- folute air it Hands upright, fixed, and ftiff between the two (boulders. The head alfo beft (hows our fupplica- tions, threats, mildnefs, pride, love, hatred, joy, and grief. The whole face, and every feature, contributes fomething $ efpecially the eyes ; which, as Cicero fays, are the windows of the foul. The paflions they more particularly difcover are, pleafure, languifhing, fcorn, feverity, mildnefs, admiration, and anger ; to which one might add joy and grief, if they did not proceed more particularly from the eyebrows and mouth ; but when thofe two paflions fall in alfo with the language of the eyes, the harmony will be wonderful. But though the paffions of the foul are mod vifible in the lines and features of the face, they often require the affiftance alfo of the other parts of the body. Without the hands, for inftance, all action is weak and imper- fedf; their motions, which are altnoft infinite, create numberlefs expreffions : it is by them that we dejire, hope, promife, call, fend bach ; they are the inftruments of threatening, prayer, horror, and praife: by them we approve, condemn, refufe, admit, fear, ajk ; exprefs our joy and grief our doubts, regrets, pain, and admi¬ ration.

"DRUID/E, or Droium, in Ancient Geography, a very ancient town, the principal place of the Druides or Druidae in Gaul, as they are called (Caefar, Cicero)",Cicero,US,5,United States,North America
"It appears, indeed, that this famous colony contribut¬ ed not a little to the Improvement of that part of Gaul where it fettled, and to the civilization of its in¬ habitants. “ The Greek colony of Marfeilles (fays Juftin) civilized the Gauls, and taught them to live under laws j to build cities and inclofe them with walls; to raife corn to cultivate the vine and olive ; and, in a word, made fo great a change both in the face of the country and the manners of its inhabitants, that Gaul feemed to be tranflated into Greece, rather than a few Greeks tranfplanted into Gaul.” But though we may allow that the druids of Gaul and Britain borrowed fome hints and embdliffiments of their philofophy from this Greek colony, and perhaps from other quarters, we have reafon to believe that the fubftance of it was their own. Others have fuggefted, that the druids derived their philofophy from Pythagoras, who pub- lifhed his doftrines at Crotona in Italy j where he lived in the higheft reputation for his virtue, wifdom, and learning, above 20 years. This conjeflure is very much confirmed by this remarkable expreffion of Am- mianus Marcellinus, “ That the druids were formed into fraternities, as the authority of Pythagoras de¬ creed.” It hath been alfo obferved, that the philofo- D R U phy of the druids bore a much greater refemblance to Druids, that of Pythagoras than to that of any other of the v—w fages of antiquity. But it feems probable, that Am- mianus meant no more by the above expreffion than to illuftrate the nature of the druidical fraternities, by comparing them to thofe of the Pythagoreans, which were well known to the Romans; and the refemblance between the Pythagorean and druidical philofophy may perhaps be beft accounted for, by fuppofing, that Pythagoras learned and adopted fome of the opinions of the druids, as well as imparted to them fome of his difcoveries. It is well known, that this philofopher, animated by the moll ardent love of knowledge, travel¬ led into many countries in purfuit of it, and got himielf admitted into every fociety that was famous for its learn¬ ing. It is therefore highly probable in itfelf, as well as direflly afferted by feveral authors, that Pythagoras heard the druids of Gaul, and was initiated into their philofophy. , From the concurring teftimonies of feveral au-More par. | thors, it appears that phyfiology, or natural philo-ticubr ac- I fophy, was the favourite ftudy of the druids of Gaul I and Britain. Cicero tells us, that he was perfonally the 1 acquainted with one of the Gaulilh druids, Divitia- cus the iEduan, a man of quality in his country, who profeffed to have a thorough knowledge of the laws of nature, or that fcience which the Greeks 4 call physics of physiology. According to Diodorus or | Siculus, Strabo, Caefar, Mela, Ammianus Marcel-1 linus, and others, they entered into many difqui- fitions and deputations in their fchools, concerning the form and magnitude of the univerfe in general, and of this earth in particular, and even concerning the moft fublime and hidden fecrets of nature. On thefe and the like fubjefts they formed a variety of fyftetns and hypothefes ; which they delivered to their difciples in verfe, that they might the more eafily retain them in their memories, fince they were not allowed to com¬ mit them to writing. Strabo hath preferved one of the phyfiological opinions of the druids concerning the univerfe ; viz. that it was never to be entirely deflroyed or annihilated ; but was to undergo a fucceffion of great changes and revolutions, which were to be produced fometimes by the power and predominancy of water, and fometimes by that of fire. This opinion, he inti¬ mates, was not peculiar to them, but was entertained alfo by the philofophers of other nations; and Cicero fpeaks of it as a truth univerfally acknowledged and un¬ deniable. “ It is impoffible for us (fays he) to attains glory that is eternal, or even of very long duration, on account of thefe deluges and conflagrations of the earth which mult neceffarily happen at certain periods.” This opinion, which was entertained by the mod an¬ cient philofophers of many different and Very diflant nations, was probably neither the refult of rational in¬ quiry in all thefe nations, nor communicated from one of them to others ; but defcended to them all from their common anceflors of the family of Noah by tra¬ dition, but corrupted and mifunderftood through length of time. The agreement of the druids with the phi¬ lofophers of fo many other nations in this opinion about the alternate diffolution and renovation of the world, gives us reafon to believe, that they agreed with them alfo in their opinion of its origin from two dif- tinft principles j the one intelligent and omnipotent, which [ 1 K R u [ 343 ] D R U Iruids. which was God 5 the other inanimate and inactive, -y—■ which was matter. We are told, by Caefar, that they had many difquifitions about the power of God j and, no doubt, amongft other particulars, about his creating power. But whether they believed with fome that mat¬ ter was eternal, or with others that it was created and in what manner they endeavoured to account for the difpofition of it into the prefent form of the univerfe, we are entirely ignorant, though they certainly had their fpeculations on thefe fubjefts. We are only in¬ formed, that they did not exprefs their fentiments on thefe and like heads in a plain and natural, but in a dark, figurative, and enigmatical manner. This might incline us to fufpeft, that Pythagoras had borrowed from them his doflrine about numbers, to whofe myfiti- cal energy he afcribes the formation of all things j for nothing can be more dark and enigmatical than that do£lrine. The druids difputed likewife about the mag¬ nitude and form of the world in general, and of the earth in particular, of which things they pretended to have a perfedt knowledge. We know not what their opinions were about the dimenfions of the univerfe or of the earth, but we have feveral reafons to make us imagine that they believed both to be of a fpherieal form. This is vifibly the (hape and form of the fun, moon, and liars, the mod confpicuous parts of the uni¬ verfe •, from whence it was natural and eafy to infer, that this was the form of the world and of the earth","Cicero, Cicero","GR,US,IT",5,"Greece,United States,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe"
"Among many other furprifing things, that author fays, concerning the Hyperborean itland, “ That its inhabi¬ tants believed that Apollo defeended into their illand at the end of every 19 years ; in which period of time the fun and moon, having performed their various revolu¬ tions, return to the fame point, and begin to repeat the fame revolutions. This is called by the Greeks the great year, or the cycle of Meton.” Their We are told both by Csefar and Mela, that the knowledge druids ftudied the liars as well as the fun and moon j of the ftars.ancl that they profeffed to know, and taught their difciples, many things concerning the motions of thefe heavenly bodies. From thefe teftimonies we may con¬ clude that the druids were acquainted with the pla¬ nets, diftinguifhed them from the fixed liars, and care¬ fully obferved their motions and revolutions. If this difeovery was the refult of their own obfervations, it would be gradual, and it would be a long time before they found out all the planets. They might perhaps have received fome aflillance and information from Py¬ thagoras, or from fome other quarter. But whether this difeovery of the planets was their own, or com¬ municated to them by others, it is highly probable that they were acquainted with the precife number of thefe wandering liars. Dio Cafiius fays, that the cullom of giving the name of one of the planets to each of the leven days of the week was an invention of the Egyp¬ tians, and from them was gradually communicated to all the other nations of the world ; and that in his time this cultom was fo firmly eltablilhed, not only among the Romans, but among all the reft of man¬ kind, that in every country it appeared to be a native inftitution. The knowledge of the planets, and per¬ haps the cuftom of giving their names to the days of the week, was brought out of Egypt into Italy by Pythagoras, more than 500 years before the beginning of the Chriftiaii era *, and from thence it could not be very long before it reached Gaul and Britain. Butv~-v-« though we have little or no reafon to doubt that the druids knew the number and obferved the motion of the planets, yet it may be queftioned whether they had difeovered the times in which they performed their fe- veral revolutions. Some of thefe liars, as Jupiter and Saturn, take fo great a number of years in revolving, that it required a very extraordinary degree of patience and attention to difeover the precife periods of their revolutions. If we could be certain that the ifland in which the ancients imagined Saturn lay afleep, was one of the Britilh ifles, as Plutarch intimates it was, we might be inclined to think that the Britilh druids were not ignorant of the length of the period in which the planet Saturn performs a revolution. For that fame au¬ thor, in another treatife, tells us, “ That the inhabi¬ tants of that illand kept every thirtieth year a folemn feftival in honour of Saturn, when his ftar entered into the fign oi Taurus.” If we could depend upon the above teftimony of Plutarch, we Ihould have one pofitive proof that the druids of the Britith ifles w’ere acquainted with the conftellations, and even with the ligns of the zodiac ; and that they meafured the revolutions of the fun and planets, by obfervmg the length of time betweeti their departure from and return to one of thefe figns* But we have no dirett evidence of this remaining in hiftory",Jupiter,"EG,IT,US",5,"Egypt,Italy,United States","Africa,Europe,North America"

But it certainly required ft ill greater knowledge of the mechanical powers, and of the method of applying them, to tranfport thofe huge ftones from the quarry to the places of their deftination 5 to ereft the perpendicular pillars, and to elevate the impofts to the tops of thefe pillars. If that prodigious ftone in the parifti of Conftantine, Cornwall, was really removed by art from its original place, and fixed where it now (lands (as one of our mod learned and diligent antiquaries thinks it was*),* Dr jj0^, it is a demonftration, that the druids could perform the moft aftoniffiing feats by their flcill in mechanics, That the Britilh druids were acquainted with the'1 ‘74 principles and ufe of the balance, we have good reafon to believe, not only from the great antiquity of that difcovery in other parts of the world, but alfo from fome druidical monuments which are (till remaining in this ifland, Thefe monuments are called Logan Stones, or rocking ftones j and each of them confifts of one prodigious block of ftone, refting upon an upright ftone or rock, and fo equally balanced, that a very fmall force, fometimes even that of a child, can move it up and down, though hardly any force is fufficient to remove it from its ftation.

"D R U r 34^ 1 D R U another. “ They are much addicted (lays Caefar) to fuperftition ; and for this caufe, thofe who are afflidled with a dangerous difeafe facritice a man, or promife that they will facrifice one, for their recovery. For this purpofe they make ufe of the miniftry of the druids ; becaufe they have declared, that the anger of the immortal gods cannot be appeafed, fo as to fpare the life of one man, but by tire life of another.” I his way of thinking gave rife alfo to that great number of magical rites and incantations with which the medical practices of the druids, and indeed of all the phyficians of antiquity, were attended. “ Nobody doubts (fays Pliny) that magic derived its origin from medicine, and that, by its flattering but delufive promifes, it came to be efteemed the muft fublime and facred part of the art of healing.” That the druids made great ufe of herbs for medi¬ cinal purpofes, we' have fufficient evidence. They not only had a moft fuperftitious veneration for the mifle- toe of the oak, on a religious account, but they alfo entertained a very high opinion of its medical virtues, and efteemed it a kind of panacea or remedy for all difeafes. “ They call it (fays Pliny) by a name which in their language fignifies All-heal, becaufe they have an opinion that it cureth all difeafes.” They believed it to be in particular a fpecifie againft barrennefs, and a fovereign antidote againft the fatal effefts of poifons of all kinds. It was efteemed alfo an excellent emol¬ lient and difcutient for foftening and difcufling hard tumours *, good for drying up fcrophulous fores ; for curing ulcers and wounds j and (provided it was not fuffered to touch the earth after it was cut) it was thought to be a very efticacious medicine in the epi- lepfy or falling ficknefs. It hath been thought ufeful in this laft calamitous difeafe by feme modern phyfi¬ cians. The pompous ceremonies with which the mifle- toe was gathered by the druids have been already de- feribed. ^ The felago, a kind of hedge hyflop refem- bling favin, was another plant much admired by the druids of Gaul and Britain for its fuppofed medicinal virtues, particularly in all difeafes of the eyes. But its efficacy, according to them, depended very much upon its being gathered exactly in the following manner: The perfon who gathered it was to be clothed in a white robe 5 to have his feet bare, and waffied in pure water \ to offer a facrifice of bread and wine before he proceeded to cut it j which he was to do with his right hand covered with the Ikirt of his garment, and with a hook of feme more precious metal than iron. When it was cut, it was to be received into, and kept in a new and very clean cloth. When it was gathered exactly according to this whimfical ritual, they affirmed that it was not only an excellent medicine, but alfo a powerful charm and prefervative from misfortunes and unhappy accidents of all kinds. They entertained a high opinion alfo of the herb famolus or marffivvort, for its fanative qualities ; and gave many diredlions for the gathering it, no lefs fanciful than thofe above men¬ tioned. The perfon who was to perform that office was to do it falling, and with his left hand } he was on no account to look behind him, nor to turn his face from the herbs he was gathering. It would be tedious to relate the extravagant notions they entertained of the rnany virtues of the vervain, and to recount the ridi¬ culous raummertes which they pra&ifed in gathering 3 and preparing it, both for the purpofes of divination and phyfic.

"The perfon who catched it was obliged to mount a fwift horfc, and to ride away at full fpeed to efcape from the ferpents, who purfued him with great rage, until they were flopped by fome river. The way of making trial of the genuinenels of the egg was no lefs extraordinary. It was to be enchafed in gold, and thrown into a river, and if it was genuine it would fwim againft the ftream. “ I have feen (fays Pliny) that egg ; it is about the bignefs of a moderate apple, its {hell is a cartilaginous incruftation, full of little ca¬ vities, fuch as are on the legs of the polypus ; it is the infignia or badge of diftinClion of the druids.” The virtues which they aferibed to this egg were many and wonderful. It was particularly efficacious to ren¬ der thofe who carried it about with them fuperior to their adverfaries in all difputes, and to procure them the favour and friendfhip of great men. Some have thought that this whole affair of the ferpents egg was a mere fraud, contrived by the druids, to excite the admiration and pick the pockets of credulous people, • who purchafed thefe wonder-working eggs from them at a high price. Others have imagined that this ftory of the anguinum (of which there is an ancient monu¬ ment in the cathedral at Paris) was an emblematical reprefentation of the do&rine of the druids concerning the creation of the world.

It may be added, that the virtue aferibed to the anguinum, of giving thofe who poffeffed it a fu- periority over others, and endearing them to great men, may perhaps be intended to reprefent the natural ef- fefts of learning and philofophy.

"As the influence and authority of the druids in their country, depended very much upon the reputation of their fuperior wifdom and learning, they wifely applied to the fludy of thofe fciences which moft direftly con¬ tributed to the fupport and advancement of that repu¬ tation. In this number, befides thofe already mention¬ ed, we may juftly reckon rhetoric, which was diligent¬ ly ftudied and taught by the druids of Gaul and Bri¬ tain ; who to the charms of their eloquence were in¬ debted for much of the admiration and authority which they enjoyed. They had indeed many calls and oppor¬ tunities to difplay their eloquence, and to difcover its great power and efficacy *, as when they were teach¬ ing their pupils in their fchools ; when they difcourfed in public to the people on religious and moral fubje&s ; when they pleaded caufes in the courts of juttice ; and when they harangued in the great councils of the na¬ tion, and at the heads of armies ready to engage in battle, fometimes with a view to inflame their cou¬ rage, and at other times with a defign to allay their fury, and difpofe them to make peace. Though this laft was certainly a very difficult talk among fierce and warlike nations, yet fuch was the authority and elo¬ quence of the druids, that they frequently fucceeded in it. “ They pay a great regard (fays Diodorus Si¬ culus) to their exhortations, not only in the affairs of peace, but even of war, and thefe are refpedfed both by their friends and enemies. They fometimes flep in between two hoflile armies, who are Handing with their fvvords drawn and their fpears extended, ready to en¬ gage ; and by their eloquence, as by an irrefiftible en¬ chantment, they prevent the eft'ufinn of blood, and prevail upon them to fheatb their fwords. So great are the charm« of eloquence and the power of wifdom even amongft the moft fierce barbarians.” The Britifh kings and chieftains, who were educated by the druids, were famous for their eloquence. This is evident from the many noble fpeeches which are afcribed to them by the Greek and Roman writers. For though thefe fpeeches may not be genuine, yet they are a proof that it was a well known faft, that thefe princes were ac- cuftomed to make harangues on thefe and the like oc- cafions. This we are exprefsly told by Tacitus :— “ The Britilh chieftains, before a battle, fly from rank to rank, and addrefs their men with animating fpeeches, tending to inflame their courage, increafe their hopes, and difpel their fears.” Thefe harangues were call¬ ed, in the ancient language of Britain, Brofmchty Kah, which is literally tranflated by Tacitus, Incita- menta Belli, “ incentives to Avar.” The genuine po- fterity of the ancient Britons long retained their tafte for eloquence, and their high efteem for thofe who ex¬ celled in that art. “ Orators (fays Mr Martin) were in high efieem, both in thefe illands (the ^Ebudae) and the continent, until within thefe forty years. I hey fat always among the nobles or chiefs of families in the ftreah or circle. Their houfes and little villages were fanftuaries, as well as churches, and they took place before doctors of phyfie. The orators, after the druids were extinft, were brought in to preferve the genealogy of families, and to repeat the fame at every lueceflion of a chief; and upon the occafion of mar¬ riages and births, they made epithalamiums and pane¬ gyrics, which the poet or bard pronounced. The ora- Druids, tors, by the force of their eloquence, had a poAverful \i afcendant over the greateft men in their time. For if any orator did but afk the habit, arms, horfe, or any other thing belonging to the greateft man in thefe iHands, it Avas readily granted him •, fometimes out of re I peel, and fometimea for fear of being exclaimed a- gainft by a fatire, which in thofe days Avas reckoned a great diffionour.” ^ If the Britiffi druids, confidering the times in which jyjagjc^an^ they lived, had made no contemptible proficiency in divination, feveral parts of real and ufeful learning, it cannot be denied that they Avere alfo great pretenders to fupe¬ rior knowledge in certain vain fallacious fciences, by Avhich they excited the admiration, and took advan¬ tage of the ignorance and credulity of mankind. Thefe were the fciences (if they may be fo called) of magic and divination ; by Avhich they pretended to work a kind of miracles, and exhibit aftonilhing appearances in nature ; to penetrate into the counfels of heaven \ to foretel future events, and to difcover the fuccefs or mifcarriage of public or private undertakings. Their own countrymen not only believed that the druids of Gaul and Britain were poffeffed of thefe poAvers, but they Avere celebrated on this account by the philo- fophers of Greece and Rome. “ In Britain (fays Pliny) the magic arts are cultivated with fuch aftoniffi- ing fuccefs, and fo many ceremonies, at this day, that the Britons feem to be capable of inftrufting even the Perfians themfelves in thefe arts. They prefeend to difcover the defigns and purpofes of the gods. The Eubates or Vates in particular inveftigate and difplay the moft fublime fecrets of nature j and, by aufpices and facrifices, they foretel future events.” 1 hey Avere fo famous for the iuppofed veracity of their predic¬ tions, that they Avere not only confulted on all import¬ ant occafions by their own princes and great men, but even fometimes by the Roman emperors. Nor is it very difficult to account for all this. The druids finding that the reputation of their magical and pro¬ phetical poAvers contributed not a little to the ad¬ vancement of their Avealth and influence, they endea¬ voured, no doubt, to ftrengthen and eftabliffi it by all their art and cunning. Their knoAvledge of natural philofophy and mechanics enabled them to execute fuch Avorks, and to exhibit fuch appearances, or to make the world believe that they did exhibit them, as were fufficient to gain them the chara&er of great magicians. The truth is, that nothing is more eafy than to acquire this charadler in a dark age, and a- mong an unenlightened people. When the minds of men are haunted Avith dreams of charms and enchant¬ ments, they are apt to fancy that the moft common oc¬ currences in nature are the effects of magical arts. The following ftrange ftory, which avc meet AAnth in Plu¬ tarch’s Treatife of the Ceffation of Oracles, Avas pro¬ bably occafioned by fomething of this kind. “ There « are many illands which lie fcattered about the ifle of Britain after the manner of our Sporades.

"But thefe pretenfions of the druids to magic and divination, which contributed fo much to the advance¬ ment of their fame and fortune in their own times, have brought very heavy reproaches upon their memo¬ ry, and have made feme learned moderns declare that they ought to be expunged out of the catalogue of philofophers, and efleemed no better than mere cheats and jugglers. This cenfure is evidently too fevere, and might have been pronounced with equal juftice upon all- the ancient philofuphers of Egypt, Afiyria, Perfia, Greece, and Rome 5 who were great pretend¬ ers to magic and divination, as well as our druids. “ I know of no nation in the world (fays Cicero) either fo polite and learned, or fo favage and barbarous, as not to believe that future events are prefignified to us,, and may by fome men be difeovered and foretold.” The only conclufion therefore that can be fairly drawn, from the fuccefsful pretenfions of the Britifli druids to the arts of magic and divination, is this—-That they bad more knowledge than their countrymen and contem¬ poraries ; but had not fo much virtue as to refill the temp¬ tation of impofing upon their ignorance to their own ad¬ vantage","Rome, Cicero","US,EG,GR",5,"United States,Egypt,Greece","North America,Africa,Europe"

This building was in the form of a crofs, ererded by David carl of Huntingdon, brother to William I. of Scot¬ land (furnamed the Lion), and was dedicated to the virgin Mary. This he did on his return from the third crufade (in which with 500 of his countrymen he had accompanied Richard I. of England) anno 1189, in gra¬ titude for his deliverance from feveral imminent dan¬ gers, and particularly from drip wreck, by which he had nearly perifhed when in fight of this town. At the fame time he changed the name of the town from Al- le&um toDeiDonum, whence its prefent name is thought by many to be derived ; while others maintain that its name was Duntay, or “ the hill of Tay.” The word AlleElum in the Gaelic fignifies “ beautiful,” and har¬ monizes very well with the Scripture fenfe of the hill of God. The word Duntay has the very fame fignifi- cation, “ the Hill of God 5” and both agree with the delightful fituation of Dundee, and unite in giving it with propriety the name of Bonny Dundee. The hill rifes on the north of the town to a great height, and is called The Law of Dundee i /am being a Saxon word for a round hill fuch as it is.

In this place, therefore, we ftiall only make a few obfervations on the nature of light and colours, which are more immediately connected with the fubjedl under confideration. For our know¬ ledge of light and vifion we are indebted to Sir Ifaac Newton. It was firft demonftrated by that lagacious philofopher, that the light of the fun is compofed of feven rays which have different powers of refrangibility",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"The violet ray is the moft refra&ed, the indigo next, and fo on to the red, which is the leaft refracted of all the rays. The fame rays of light alfo differ in their degrees of reflexibility. All known colours, and their different fbades, are produced by mixing together the different rays. Thus, for inftance, by mixing to¬ gether red and yellow, an orange colour is obtained j yellow and blue give a green colour $ and blue and red, according to their different proportions, produce a violet, pmple, &c. and thus, as Sir Ifaac Newton has obferved, the variety of colours depends on the compofition of light; for if the fun’s light confifted but of one fort of rays, there would be but one colour",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"30. Newton has demonftrated, that tranfparentCaufe of bodies refleff the ray*s of one colour, and tranfmit thofecolour5'r of another, according to the difference of their thick-rVtft^au nefs or denfity. He obferves that tranfparent fub¬ ftances, fuch as glafs, water, air, &c. w hen made veiy thin by being blown into bubbles, or otherwife formed into plates, exhibit various colours, according to their various thinnefs ; although at a greater thicknefs they appear very clear and colourlefs. His method of con- dudling thefe experiments was the following. He took two objedl-glafi'es, the one a plano-convex for a 14 feet telefcopo, and the other a large, double convex, for one of about 50 feet j and upon this laying the other with its plain fide downwards, he prefied them flowly together, to make the colours fuccefiively emerge in the middle of the circles, and then flowly lifted the upper glafs from the lower, to make them fucceflively vanifli again, in the fame place. The colour which, by prefling the glaffes together, emer¬ ged, laft in the middle of the other colours, would, upon its firft appearance, look like a circle of a colour al- moft uniform from the circumference to the centre j and by comprefling the glaffes fiill more, grow conti¬ nually broadtr, until a new coh ur emeiged in its cen¬ tre, and thereby it became a ring, encompafling that new colour 5 and by comprefling the glaffes ft ill more, the diameter of this ring would increafe, until another new colour emerged in the centre of the laft, and fo on, until a third, a fourth, a fifth, and other follow¬ ing new colours fucceflively emerged there, and be¬ came I. DYE came rings, eneompaifing the innermoft colour, the ’ laft of Avhich was the black fpot. And on the con¬ trary, by lifting up the upper glafs from the lower, the diameter of the rings would decreafe, and the breadth of their orbit increafe, until their colours reached fuc- ceflively to the centre, and then, as they were of con- fiderable breadth, he could more eafily difcern their fpecies than before. By proceeding in this manner, he produced 25 different-coloured, circular rings, which he divided into feven orders, becaufe the fame co¬ lour was always repeated. They are reckoned from the central colour, which was always black, in the fol¬ lowing order: 1. Blue, white, yellow, and red",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"4. Green, red",Green,US,5,United States,North America
"32. Thefe experiments were repeated on films of water and alfo of glafs $ and it was found that the thicknefs of the films in thefe cafes, refledfing any par¬ ticular colour, was diminifhed, and this diminution ap¬ peared to be proportional to the denfity of the re- tledling film. As there is no method of meafuring the diftance between the two glaffes where the black fpot appears, it is impoflible to afcertain the abfolute thick¬ nefs of the films ; but it certainly does not exceed the 1 OOOth part of an inch. Newton, however, endeavour¬ ed by a mathematical invefligation to meafure the rela¬ tive thicknefs of air, water,and glafs, at which the feve- ral orders of colour appear.

"According to Sir Ifaac Newton, the refraftive and re¬ flexive powers of bodies are nearly proportional to their denfities, and the leaft refrangible rays require the greateft power to rtfleX them. From this, Mr Delaval fuppofed, that denfer fubftances, by their greater re- fleXive power, ought in fimilar cireumftances to refleX the lefs refrangible rays ; and that Jubilances of lefs denfity fhould refleX rays proportionably more refran¬ gible, and therefore appear of feveral colours in the or¬ der of their denfity. The denfeft bodies, he fuppofes, are the red j the next in denfity are the orange j the next are the yellow ; and fo on, according to the order of the refrangibility of the different rays. Mr Delaval fume time after extended his refearehes to animal and vegetable- fubftances, and endeavoured to eftablifh the theory of Newton by a great number of experiments, a-n account of which he publilhed in an effay entitled, an Experimental Inquiry into the caufe of the Permanent Colours of Opaque Bodies f. _ j- Manche- 35. According to the theory of Newton, with the/fcr Menu exception of combuftible bodies which follow a differ-ii. 131® ent law, colour depends folely upon the fize of the in¬ tegrant particles of bodies, in which the denfity is the fame •, and upon the fize and denfity of all bodies taken together. But the evidence for the truth of this theory can only be derived from experiment. Newton ad¬ duced but a fmall number of experiments in fupport of it. The experiments of Mr Delaval were more nu¬ merous and more varied ; but they were made long be¬ fore the important faXs in chemical fcience, which have completely changed the views and, opinions of pbilo- fophers, with regard to the nature and aXion of the conftituent principles of bodies, were difcovered ; fo that it is now univerfally acknowledged that they proceed¬ ed on a falfe hypothefis. It was fuppofed that alka¬ lies enlarge, and that acids diminifh, the fize of the particles of bodies on which they aX, without indu¬ cing any other change. This opinion, in the prefent ftate of chemical knowledge, will not readily find a place","Newton, Newton, Newton, Newton",US,5,United States,North America

But the colour of the com¬ pound is white j and, according to the theory, it fhould be accompanied with a diminution of the fize of the particles, which is not the cafe. The colour of indigo is naturally green. The addition of oxygen, which mud increafe the fize of the particles, converts it to a Chemical blue colour. This, then, is another cafe incompatible fe^theco"" wit*1 the Newtonian theory ; and from thefe faffs it lour. mud appear, that this theory is deficient in accounting for the refleflion or tranfmidion of particular rays, and the abforption of the red. It is not fufficient for the explanation of the caufes of colour. The fmallnefs and the denfity of particles are not the only circumdances which ought to be taken into the account, in explain¬ ing the caufe of colour in bodies. It appears, from Newton’s own experiments, that we mud have recourfe to the chemical properties of bodies, which have a con- fiderable influence on their colour. It cannot be fup- Part Colours of metals in¬ dependent pofed, that a force which afls powerfully in refraftino nr the rays, will not alfo have great influence in their re°- U !?lou fle&ion. , ^ 41. Numerous faffs tend to prove that bodies have Affi ■ a particular affinity for the rays of light ; and indeed bodiesW it is entirely upon thefe affinities that the phenomena^tain of light depend. Coloured bodies have a certain affi-r?Ts the nity for fome of the rays of light. Thofe rays f0rCaMeof which any body has a drong affinity, are abforbed by C° ^ it, and retained ; while the other rays, for which it has no affinity, are either refle&ed or tranfmitted, accord¬ ing to the nature of the body, as it may be opaque or tranfparent, and according to the direffion of the inci¬ dent ray. A red body, for indance, /efleffs only the red rays, becaufe it has an affinity for all the other rays, excepting the red. It therefore abforbs them, if it be an opaque body, or tranfmits them if it be tranf¬ parent. A green body abforbs all the rays excepting the green ; a black body has a drong affinity for all the rays, and therefore 'they are all abforbed ; while a white, body, which has little affinity for any of the rays, if it be opaque, refleffs, or if tranfparent, tranf¬ mits them all",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"42. The differences which exid between the parti-changesi cles of bodies, may be conceived to be differences in colour fize, denfity, and figure j and changes in thefe cir-0^11?10 cumdances may account for all the varieties of affinity. ^ifJ“rence If then affinity depends.upon thefe circumdances, and“Ihept if the colour of bodies is to be afcnbed to the affinity tides, between their particles and the different rays of light, the caufe of the colour of bodies, it feeros obvious, is capable of being accounted for from the dze, denfity, and figure of their particles. It cannot be accounted for, according to the theories of Newton and Delaval, folely on the variations in fize and denfity",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"44. In the ingenious experiments of Mr Delaval, which we have already alluded to, he has ffiown that coloured matters do not refleft any light. “ Reflec¬ tive media, (he obferves), adt indifcriminately on all the different rays. It does not appear from the opti¬ cal phenomena which have hitherto been obferved, that nature affords any kind of matter endowed with a power of refledling one fort of rays more copioufly than the other forts j confequently no reflediive fub- ffances are capable of feparating the differently refran¬ gible rays, and thereby producing colours. There are feveral experiments and obfervations in Sir Ifaac Newton’s optics, from which it might have been in¬ ferred, that coloured light is not refledted from co¬ loured matter, but from white or colourlefs matter only. Although that great philofopher fuppofes that all coloured bodies refledl the rays of their own co¬ lours more copiouflv than the reft, yet he obferves that they do not refledt the light of their own colours fo copiouflv as white bodies''do. If red-lead, for in- ftance, and white paper, be placed in the red light of the coloured fpedhum, made in a dark chamber by the refradfion of a prifm, the paper will appear more lucid than the red lead, and therefore refledls the red-making- rays more copioufly than red-lead doth *",Newton,US,5,United States,North America

"33. The relation between the fpace deferibed and the time which elapfes is the only immediate obfervation to be made on thefe variable motions. By means of the foregoing propofitions, the mechanical condition of the body, or rather the effe£l and meafure of this condi¬ tion, denominated velocicq, is inferred. The fame in¬ ference is made in another way. Sir Ifaac Newton often reprefents the uniform lapfe of time by the uni¬ form increafe of an area during the motion along the line taken for the abfcifla. The velocities or determi¬ nations to motion in the different points of this line, are inverfely proportional to the ordinates of the curve which bounds this area",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"Thus it appears that the diredion and meafure of the defledions by which a body deviates continually into a curvilineal path cannot be afeertained, but by invefti- gating the ultimate pnfitions and ratios of the lines, which join the points of the curve with the fimultaneous points of the tangent, as the points ^ and C are taken nearer to B. In fome cafes, but rarely, the lines join¬ ing the fimultaneous points are parallel. But in moil cafes the diredion of the defledion is difeovered by obferving to what diredion it approximates.

"This is the phrafe inertia, or vis inertia:. This expref¬ fion, which was introduced by Kepler, feems to have been generally employed by him as well as by Newton to exprefs the fa& of the perfeverance of body in a ftate of motion or reft. Sometimes, however, it has been employed by thefe philefophers to exprefs fome- thing like indifference to motion or reft ; and this is fuppofed to be manifefted by body requiring the fame quantity of force to make an augmentation of its mo¬ tion, as is neceffary to produce an- equal diminution of it. To fuppofe refiftance from a body at reft feems to be in diredt contradiction to the common ufe of the word force; and yet this expreffion vis inertue is very common. It is not lefs abfurd to fay that a body re¬ mains in the condition of reft by the exertion of a vis viertice-, than to affirm that it maintains itielf in a Plate of motion by the exertion of an inherent force. Such expreftions, which are metaphorical, (hould be carefully avoided, becaufe they are apt to lead to mifconception of the procedure of nature",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"127. This law of motion alfo may almoft be confi* dered as an identical propofition. It is equivalent faying that the changing force is to be meaiured by the change produced, and the diredlion of this force is the dtredlion of the change. Confidering the force only in the fenfe of its being the caufe of motion, and with¬ drawing the attention from the manner or form of its exertion, there can be no doubt ot this. In whatever way a body is put in motion, whether by the expanfive force of the air, by the unbending of a fpring, or by any fimilar preffure, when it moves oft' in the lame di¬ redlion, and with the fame velocity,, the force or the exertion of the force is confidered as the fame. Even when it is put in motion by inftantaneous percuffion from a fmart ftroke, although in this cafe the manner of the efftdl being produced is effentially different from the other cafes, we cannot conceive the propelling force, as fuch, but as precifely one and the fame. 1 he expveflion of this law of motion by Newton is equi¬ valent to faying, “ that the changes of motion are ta¬ ken as the meafures of the changing forces, and the diredlion of the change is taken as the indication of the diredlion of the forces ; for it cannot be faid that it is a deduaion from the acknowledged principle, that but not .fMsare proportional to their canfes. This la.'* not affirmed from the proportion of the forces and the uo proportion of the changes, and that thefe proportions torceS",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"129. It feems to be confidered by Sir Ifaac Newton only as a phyfical law. And in this fenfe good argu¬ ments are not wanting. A ball which moves with a double, triple, or quadruple velocity, generates by im- pulfe in another, a double, triple, or quadruple velo¬ city, or it generates the fame velocity in a double, tri¬ ple, or quadruple quantity of matter, and lofing at the fame time fimilar proportions ot its own velocity",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"130. Thefe fafts were brought forward by Leibnitz Eftimation in fupport of his own pretenfions to the difeovery of theof^'bnitz real nature and meafure of mechanical aftion and force, which he faid had been hitherto totally miftaken. He affirmed that the inherent force of a moving bodv was in the proportion of the fquare of the velocity. In this argument he was fupported by John Bernoulli, who adduced many fimple fafts to confirm the relation between the inherent force of a moving body and it* velocity. One of the ftrongeft arguments urged by Leibnitz i«, that the inherent force of a moving body is to be eftimated by all that it is able to do before the total extinftion of its motion ; and therefore when it penetrates four times as far, it is to be confidered as having produced a quadruple efftft. In this mode of eftimation many things are gratuitoufly affumed, many contradiftions are incurred j and it is only becaufe forces are affumed as proportional to the velocities which they generate, that thefe fafts come to be proportional to the fquares of the fame velocity. When Leibnitz is incorreft affumes the quadruple penetration as the proof of the quadruple force of a body having twice the velocity, he has not confidered that a double time is employed during this penetration. But a double force, afting equably during a double time, ffiould produce a qua¬ druple effeft. This circumftance is loft fight of in all the fafts which this philofopher has adduced. It may, however, be obferved, that Leibnitz, as well as his followers, holds no difference of opinion in all the con- fequences which are deduced from the meafure which is here adopted. They admit, that a force producing an uniformly accelerated motion muft be conftant; they agree with the followers of Des Cartes in the valuations both of accelerating and deflecting forces *, and have affiduoufly and fuccefsfully cultivated the philofophy of Newton, which proceeds on the principle of eftimating the meafure of moving forces by the velocity gene¬ rated",Newton,US,5,United States,North America

But if the term law of motion be limited to thofe confequences that neceffarily flow from our notions of motion, of the caufes of its produc¬ tion and changes, this propofition is not fuch a refult",Newton,US,5,United States,North America
"Newton difeovered that the fun adls on the planets, and that the earth adfs on the moon. It had been obferved too by Newton that the iron readts on the magnet, that the adlions of eledtrified bodies are mutual, and that all the adlions of folid bodies are accompanied by an equal and contrary readlion. On the authority of the rule of philofophizing which he had laid down, he affirmed that the planets readt on the fun, and that the fun is I M I C S. Part,, • not at reft, but is- continually agitated by a fmall mo-ofM • tion round the general centre of gravitation ; and he Forced * pointed out feveral of the confequences of this reaction.V'. • As the celeftial motions were more narrowly examined by aftronomers, thefe confequences were found to ob¬ tain, and to produce difturbances in the planetary mo¬ tions. This reciprocity of action is now found to hold with the utmoft precifion through the whole of the fo- lar lyftem ; and therefore this third propofition of New¬ ton is to be confidered as a law of nature.

For now, the king having provoked his fubje&s throughout all Scotland with the innovations he attempted in religion, Edinburgh was made the general place of rendezvous, and the mod formidable affociations took place ; an account of which has already been given under the ar¬ ticle Britain.

In 1736, however, the city had again the misfortune to fall under the royal difpleafure, on the following account.* Two fmugglers having been dete£led in ftealing their own goods out of a cuftomhoufe, were condemned to be hanged. The crime was looked upon as trivial 5 and therefore a general murmur prevailed among the populace, which was no doubt heightened by the fol- jS lowing accident. At that time it had been cuftomaryCaptain for perfons condemned to die to be carried each Sun-Porteous day to the church, called from that circumftance thee*ecu^}tj Tolbooth church. The two prifoners juft mentioned**m<> were condu6ted in the ufual way, guarded by three foldiers, to prevent their making their efcape: but ha¬ ving once gone thither a little before the congrega¬ tion met, one of the prifoners feized one of the guards in each hand, and the other in his teeth, calling out to his companion to run *, which he immediately did with fuch fpeed, that he foon got out of fight, and ' was never heard of afterwards.

By this Captain Porteous, who commanded the guard, was fo much provoked, that he gave orders to fire, by which fix people were killed and eleven wounded. The evidence, however, even - of the fa6I that the orders to fire were given, appears not to have been altogether unexceptionable j never- thelefs, on this he was tried and condemned to be exe¬ cuted.

They then took out Porteous, whom it was found impoffible to refeue out of their hands, though every method that the magi- ftrates could take for that purpofe in fuch a confufion was made ufe of. It was even proved that the member of parliament went to the commander in chief, and re- quefted that he would fend a party of foldiers to quell the difturbance, but was abfolutely denied this requeft, becaufe he could not produce a written order from the provoft to this purport •, which, in the confufion then ex- ifting in the city, could neither have been expefted to be given by the provoft, nor would it have been fafe for any perfon to have carried it about him.

"Tumults have been frequent in Edinburgh, chiefly on account of the dearnefs of provifions. In 1740 Bell’s mills were firft attacked by the populace, and afterwards Leith mills ; nor could the rioters be difperfed till the military had fired among them and wounded three, of whom one died *, and it was found neceflary to order fome dragoons into the city in order to preferve tran¬ quillity. In 1742, another violent tumult took place, owing to a cuftom of ftealing dead bodies from their graves for anatomical purpofes, which had then become common. The populace beat to arms, threatened deftruc* tion to the furgeons $ and, in fpite of the efforts of the magiftrates, demolifhed the houfe of the beadle at St Cuthbert’s. In 1756 new difturbances, which required the afliftance of the military, took place : the caufe at this time was the impreffing of men for the war which was then commencing. A difturbance was likewife ex¬ cited in 1760. This was occafioned by the footmen, who till then were allowed to follow their matters into the play houfe, and now took upon them to difturb the en¬ tertainment of the company ; the confequence of which was, that they were turned out, and have ever fince been obliged to wait for their mafters.

"In the years 1778 and 1779 two very alarming, di¬ fturbances happened, which threatened a great deal of bloodihed, though happily they were terminated with¬ out any. The firft was a mutiny of the earl of Sea~ forth’s Highland regiment, who were at this time quar¬ tered in the caftle. Thefe having been ordered to em¬ bark, for fome reafon or other unanimoufly refufed, and potted themfelves on the top of Arthur’s feat, where they continued for two days. Troops were colle&ed to prevent their efcape, and the inhabitants were ordered to keep within doors at the firft toll of the great bell, which was to be a fignal of violence about to take place ; but fortunately all the fears, naturally arifing from the expectation of this event, were diflipated by an accommodation. The other happened on account of the attempt to repeal the penal laws againft the Papifts; and was much more alarming than the other, as being the eflFeCl of a premeditated fcheme and determined re- folution to oppofe government. On the fecond of Febru¬ ary 1779 a mob afiembled in the evening, burned a Popilh chapel, and plundered another. Next day they renewed their depredations.; deftroying and carrying off the books, furniture, &c. of feveral Popifli priefts and others of that perfuafion. The riot continued all that day, though the affiftance of the military was called in ; but happily no lives were loft, nor was there any firing. The city was afterwards obliged to make good the damage fuftained by the Catholics on this occafion, which was eftimated at 1500I. This year alfo an unlucky accident happened at Leith. About 50 Highland recruits having refufed to embark, a par¬ ty of the South Fencibles was fent to take them pri- foners. Unexpectedly, however, the Highlanders flood upon their defence; when, after fome words, a firing commenced on both fides, and about one half of the Highlanders were killed and wounded, the remainder being taken prifoners and carried to the caftle.

"Having thus given an account of the mod remark¬ able edifices belonging to Old Edinburgh, we fhall now .proceed to thofe of the New Town. This is terminated on the ead fide by the Calton hill, round which there is a pleafant walk, and which affords one of the fined profpefts that can be imagined, vary¬ ing remarkably almod at every dep. On this hill is a burying ground, which contains a fine monument to the memory of David Hume the hidorian.—On the. top is an obfervatory, the fcheme for building which was fird adopted in the year 1736; but the di- durbance occafioned by the Porteous mob prevented any thing from being done towards the execution of it at that time. The earl of Morton afterwards gave look for the purpofe of building an obfervatory, and appointed.Mr M‘Laurin profeffor of mathematics, to¬ gether with the principal and fome profeffors of the umverfity, trudees for managing the fum. Mr M‘Lau- rin added to the money above mentioned the profits arifing from a courfe of leftures which he read on ex¬ perimental philofophy ; which, with fome other fmall fums, amounted in all to 300I.; but Mr M‘Laurin dying, the defign was dropped.-—Afterwards the mo¬ ney was put into the hands of two perfons who became bankrupt 5 but a confiderable dividend being obtained out of their effefts, the principal and intered, about the year 1776, amounted to 400I.

About this time, however, Mr Adam architeft happening to come to Edinburgh, conceived the idea of giving the whole the appearance of a fortification, for which its fituation on the top of the Calton hill was very much adapted.

"Entertainments of the dramatic kind came very early into fafliion in this country. They were at firft only reprefentations of religious fubje&s, and peculiarly de¬ figned to advance the intererts of religion ; the clergy being the compofers, and Sunday the principal time of exhibition.. In the 16th century, the number of play- houfes was fo great, that it was complained of as a nui- fance, not only in Edinburgh, but throughout the kingdom. They foon degenerated from their original inftitution ‘7 and the plays, inftead of being calculated to infpire devotion, became filled with all manner of buffoonery and indecency.—After the Reformation, the Prefbyterian clergy complained of thefe indecencies j and being a£luated by a fpirit of violent zeal, anathe- matifed every kind of theatrical reprefentation what¬ ever. King James VI. compelled them to pal's from their cenfures againft the ftage y but in the time of Charles I. when fanaticifm was carried to the utmoft length at which perhaps it was poffible for it to arrive, it cannot be fuppofed that ftage plays would be tolera¬ ted.—It feems, however, that amufemen-ts of this kind were again introduced at Edinburgh about the year 1684, when the duke of York kept his court there. His refidence at Edinburgh drew off one half of the London company, and plays were a bled in E- dinburgh for fome little time.. 1'he misfortunes at¬ tending the duke of York, however, and the eftabliffi- ment of the Prefbyterian religion (the genius of which is unfavourable to amufements of this kind), foon put a flop to the progrefs of the ftage, and no theatrical exhibition was heard of in Edinburgh till after the year 1715. The firft adventurer was Signora Violante, an Italian, remarkable for feats of ftrength, tumbling, &c.

"Still, however, theatrical amufements were but rare.. The town was vifited by itinerant companies only once in two or three years.

About this time an aft of parliament was paffed, prohibiting the exhibition of plays, except in a houfe licenfed by the king. Of this the prefby- tery of Edinburgh immediately laid hold j and at their own expence brought an aftion on the ftatute againll the players. The caufe was by the court of feffion decided againft the players j who thereupon applied to parliament for a bill to enable his majefty to licenfe a theatre in Edinburgh. Againft this bill petitions were presented in 1739 to the houfe of commons by the magiftrates and town council, the principal and pro- feffors of the univerfity, and the dean of guild and his council; in confequence of which, the affair was drop-* ped.. All this oppofition, however, contributed in reality to the fuccefs of the players j for the fpirit of party being excited, a way of evading the aft was ea- fily found out, and the houfe was frequented more than ufual, in&much that Taylor’s Hall was found in-: fufficient to contain the number of fpeftators","Taylor, Of, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Taylor","US,GB,TR",5,"United States,United Kingdom,Turkey","North America,Europe,Asia"
"The comedians now fell out among themfelves, and a new plavhoufe was erefted in the Canongate in the year 1746. The confequence of this was, that the old one in Taylor’s Hall became entirely deferted, and through bad conduft the managers of the new theatre foon found themfelves greatly involved. At laft, a riot enfuing through diffenfions among the performers, the play houfe was totally demoliftied.—When the extenfion of the royalty over the fpot where the New Town is built was obtained, a claufe was likewife added to the bill, enabling his majefty to licenfe a theatre in Edin¬ burgh. This was obtained, and thus the oppofition of the clergy for ever filenced. But notwithftanding this, the high price paid by the managers to the pa¬ tentee, being no lefs than 500 guineas annually, pre¬ vented them effeftually from decorating the houfe as they would otherwife have done, or even from always retaining good aftors in their fervice •, by which means the fuccefs of the Edinburgh theatre has not been fo great as might have been expefted^ Not far from this building, an amphitheatre was opened in 1790, on the road to Leith, for equeftrian exhibitions, pantomime entertainments, dancing, and tumbling.

We have formerly taken notice of one circumftance in favour of a claflical education, to which it may be wards^flie0"" ProPer *0 reca^ *be attention of our readers. We ob- improve ferved, that the cultivation of claflical learning has a merit of favourable influence on the living languages. It has our mother a tendency to preferve their purity from being debaf- tongue. ancj ^eir analogy from becoming irregular. In ftudying the dead languages, we find it neceffary to pay more attention to the principles of grammar than in acquiring our mother tongue. We learn our native language without attending much to its analogy and ftrufture. Of the numbers who fpeak Englifh through the Britifh dominions, but few are Ikilled in the in¬ flexion of its nouns and verbs, or able to diftinguilh between adverbs and conjunXions. Defirous only of making their meaning underflood, they are not anxi¬ ous about purity or correXnefs of fpeech. They re- jeX not an exprtflion which occurs to them, becaufe it is barbarous or ungrammatical. As they grew up they learned to fpeak from their mothers, their nurfes and others about them •, they were foon able to make known their wants, their willies, and their obferva- 66 Utility of claflical themfelves in their mother tongue without acquiring any accurate knowledge of its general principles. If thefe people find occafion to exprefs themfelves in writing, they, are fcarce more ftudious of correXnefs and elegance in writing than in fpeaking 5 or, though they may afpire after thofe properties, yet they can never attain them. But fuch writers or fpeakers can never refine any language* or reduce it to a regular analogy. Neither can they be expeXed to diftinguilh themfelves as the guardians of the purity and regularity of their native tongue, if it fliould before have attained a high degree of per- feXion. But they who, in learning a language dif¬ ferent from their native tongue, have found it necef¬ fary to pay particular attention to the principles of grammar, afterwards apply the knowledge of grammar which they have thus acquired in ufing their mother tongue j and by that means become better acquainted with its ftruXure, and learn to write and fpeak it with more correXnefs and propriety. Befides, the lan¬ guages of Greece and Rome are lo highly diftinguilh- ed for their eopioufnefs, their regular analogy, and for various other excellencies, which render them fu- perior to even the chief of modern languages, that the ftudy of them has a natural tendency to improve and enrich modern languages. If we look backwards to the 15th century, when learning began to revive in Europe, and that fpecies of learning which began firft to be cultivated was claflical literature, we find that almoft all the languages then fpoken in Europe were wretchedly poor and barbarous. Knowledge could not be communicated, nor bufinefs tranfaXed, without- calling in the aid of Latin. Claflical learning, how¬ ever, foon came to be cultivated by all ranks with en- thufiaftic eagernefs. Not only thofe defigned to pur- fue a learned profeflion, and men of fortune whofe ob- jeX was a liberal education without a view to any par¬ ticular profefiion j but even the lower ranks, and the female fex, keenly ftudied the languages and the wif¬ dom of Greece and Rome. This avidity for claflical learning was followed by many happy effeXs. But its influence was chiefly remarkable in producing an ama¬ zing change on the form of the living languages. Thefe foon became more copious and regular j and many of them have confequently attained fuch perfeXion, that the poet, the hiftorian, and the philofopher, can clothe their thoughts in them to the greatefl advantage., Cou!d vve derive no new advantage from the ftudy of the ancient languages, yet would they be worthy of our care, as having contributed fo much to raife the modern languages to their prefent improved ftate. But they can alfo conduce to the prefervation and fupport of thofe noble ftruXures which have been reared by their afliftance. The intercourfe of nations, the afiec- tation of writers, the gradual introduXion of provin¬ cial barbariftns, and various other caufes, have a ten¬ dency to corrupt and debale even the nobleft languages^ By fuch means were the languages of Greece and Rome gradually corrupted, till the language uled by a Horace, a Livy, a Xenophon, and a Menander, was loft in a jargon unfit for the purpofes of compofition","Of, Rome, Rome, Rome","GR,US,TR",5,"Greece,United States,Turkey","Europe,North America,Asia"

"Books were then fcarce, and thofe few which were to be obtained were no very rich treafuries of ufe- ful information. The rhapfodies of a poet, the rude legends of fome ill-informed and fabulous hiftorian, or the theories of fanciful philofophers, were all that they could afford. Thales, Lycurgus, Solon, Plato, tra¬ velled, feeking that knowledge among more civilized nations which they could not find in their native coun¬ try. In the courfe of their travels, they heard the lec¬ tures of celebrated philofophers ; confulted the priefts, who were the guardians of the traditions of antiquity, concerning the nature and origin of thofe traditions ; and obferved the inftitutions of thofe nations which were moft renowned for the wifdom of their legifia- ture. When they fet out to vifit foreign countries, they feemed to have propofed to themfelves a certain end ; and by keeping that end fteadily in view during the courfe of their travels, they gained fuch improve¬ ment as to be able on their return to command the veneration of their countrymen by means of the know¬ ledge which they were enabled to communicate. Many befides the philofophers of ancient Greece have tra¬ velled for improvement, and have fucceeded in their views.

"00 Much has been faid concerning the utility of a 0 hippy knowledge of the world, and the advantage of acqui-effects of ring it at an early period of life. But thofe who have the mod earneflly recommended this knowledge of the tion int() world, have generally explained themlelves in fo inac-the world.• curate a manner concerning it, that it is difficult to underdand what ideas they affix to it. They feem. to wiffi, E D U [ 5§2 ] E D W Education, wiflv, that, in order to acquire it, young people may '“■““Y—be early made acquainted with all the vices and follies of the world, introduced into polite company, carried t to public places, and not confined even from the ga¬ ming table and the (lews. Some knowledge of the ■world may, no doubt, be gained by thefe means. But it is furely dearly purchafed j nor are the advantages which can be derived from it fo confiderable, as to tempt the judicious and affe&ionate parent to expofe his child to the infe61ion of vanity, folly, and vice, for their fake. Carry a boy or girl into public life at the age of fourteen or fifteen j (how them all the fcenes of fplendid vanity and diffipation which adorn London or Paris j tell them of the importance of drefs, and of the ceremonies of good breeding and the forms of in- tercourfe j teach them that falhionable indifference and affurance which give the ton to the manners of our fine gentlemen and fine ladies of the prefent age. What effects can you expe£t the fcenes into which you intro¬ duce them, and the myfleries which you now teach them, to produce on the minds of the children ? They have a dire£f tendency to infpire them with a tafte for vanity, frivolity, and diffipation. If you wiffi them to be like the foolifh, the diffipated, and the gay, you are likely to obtain your purpofe ; but if, on the con¬ trary, your views are to prepare them for difcharging tne duties of life, you could not adopt more improper means 5 for though they be well acquainted with all thofe things on which you place fo much value, yet they have not thereby gained any acceffion of ufeful knowledge. They are not now more able than before to eftimate the real value of objefts ; nay, their judge¬ ment is now more liable than before to be milled in eftimating the value of the obje&s around them. Lux- ury, vanity, and faffiion, have ftamped on many things an ideal value. By mingling at an early age in thofe icenes of the world where luxury, vanity, and faffiion, reign with arbitrary iway, young people are naturally impreiTed with all thofe prejudices which thefe have a tendency to infpire. Inftead of acquiring an ufeful knowledge of the world, they are rendered incapable of ever viewing the world with an unprejudiced and difcerning eye. If poffible, therefore, we ffiould ra¬ ther labour to confine young people from mingling in the fcenes of gay and diffipated life till after they have attained maturity of age and judgment. They will then view them in a proper light, and perhaps be happy enough to efcape the infetlious contagion of vice","Much, London, Paris","DE,GB,US",5,"Germany,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"Dr Nicolas, a perfon of eminence in the phyfical world, and a relation of his mafter’s, happened to die. The Doctor’s books were removed to an apartment occu¬ pied by Edw’ards, who eagerly employed all his leifure hours, both in the day and great part of the night, in perufing thofe which treated of natural hiftory,' fculp- ture, painting, aftronomy, and antiquities. The reading of thefe books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile bufinefs he might have formerly had, and herefolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he vifited moft of the principal towns in Holland, and in about a month returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was difpofed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the mafter of the ffiip in which he em¬ barked. At this time Charles XII. was befieging Fre- derickffiall \ by which means our young naturalift was hindered from making fuch excurfions into the coun¬ try as other wife he could have done, for the Swedes were very careful to confine fuch ftrangers as could not give Educatfoi II Edwards, E D W [ 5S3 1 E D Y } ?ards. g‘ve a g00^ account themfelves. Bat notwithftand- L y—^ ing all his precaution, he was confined by the Danilh guard, who fuppofed him to be a fpy employed by the enemy to get intelligence of their defigns. However, by obtaining tellimonials of his innocence, a releafe was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year vifited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During his flay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each ; the firft to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720 j the fecond on foot, to Orleans and Blois; but an edidl happening at that time to be iffued for fecuring va¬ grants, in order to tranfport them to America, as the banks of the MifliiTippi wanted population j our au¬ thor narrowly efcaped a weftern voyage. On his ar¬ rival in England, Mr Edwards clofely purfued his fa¬ vourite ftudy of natural hiftory, applying himfelf to drawing and colouring fuch animals as fell under his notice. A ftrift attention to natural, more than pic- tureique beauty, claimed his e.arlieft care : birds firft engaged his particular attention ; and having pur- chaled lome of the beft pictures of thefe fubjedts, he was induced to make a few drawings of bis own j which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalift to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours. Among his firft patrons and bene- faftors may be mentioned James Theobalds, Efq. of Lambeth } a gentleman zealous for the promotion of fcience. Our artift, thus unexpectedly encouraged, in- creafed in Ikill and afliduity j and procured, by his ap¬ plication to his favourite purfuit, a decent fubfiftence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted hisin- duftry in 1731 ; when, in company with two of his re¬ lations, he made an excurfion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected feveral fcarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original pictures of feveral great maftersat Antwerp, Brufiels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the recommenda¬ tion of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart, prefident of the College of Phyficians, he was chofen librarian, and had apartments in the college. This office was peculiarly a- greeable to histafteand inclination, as he had the oppor¬ tunity of a conftant recourfe to a valuable library, fill¬ ed with fcarce and curious books on the fubjeCt of na¬ tural hiftory, which he fo affiduoufiy ftudied. By de¬ grees he became one of the moll eminent ornithologifts in this or any other country. His merit is fo well known in this refpeCt, as t« render any eulogium on his pertormances unneceflary : but it may be obf^rved, that he never trufted to others what he could perform him¬ felf ; and often found it fo difficult to give fatisfaftion to his own mind, that he frequently made three or four drawings to delineate the objeCt in its molt lively cha¬ racter, attitude, and reprefentation.

"Some time after Mr Edwards had been appointed library keeper to the Royal College of Phyficians, he was, on St Andrew’s day, in the year 1750, prefented with an honorary compliment by the prefident and council of the Royal Society, with the gold medal, the donation of Sir Godfrey Copley, Bart, annually given on that day to the author of any new difcovery in art or nature, in confideration of his natural hiftory juft then completed. A copy of this medal he had after¬ wards engraved, and placed under the title in the firft volume of his hiftory. He was a few years afterwards eleCted fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries, London 5 and alio a member of many of the academies of fciences and learning in different parts of Europe. In compliment to thofe honorary diltinCtions from fuch learned bodies, he prefented ele¬ gant coloured copies of all his works to the Royal Col¬ lege ot Phyficians, the Royal Society, and Society of Antiquarians, and to the Britiffi mufeum : alfo to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, from whom he re¬ ceived the moft polite and obliging letter of thanks by their then fecretary Monfieur Defouchy. His collec¬ tion of drawings, which amounted to upwards of 900, were purchafed by the earl of Bute. They contain a great number of Britiffi as well as foreign birds, and other animals hitherto not accurately delineated or de¬ fcribed. After the publication of the laft work, being arrived at his 70th year, he found his fight begin to fail, and his hand loft its wonted fteadinels. He retired from public employment to a little houfe which he purchaf¬ ed at Plaiftow ; previous to which, he difpofed of all the copies, as well as plates of his works. The conver- fation of a few feleft friends, and the perufal of a tew feledt books, were the amufement of the evening of his life j and now and then he made an excurfion to fome of the principal cities in England, particularly to Bri- ftol, Bath, Exeter, and Norwich. Some years before his death, the alarming depredation of a cancer, which baffled all the efforts of medical Ikill, deprived him of the fight of one of his eyes : he alfo luffered much from the (tone, to which at different periods of his life he had been fubje£t.

The opinion of the common people was, that the building would not be of long duration. Mr Winftanley, however, held different fentiments. Being amongft his friends previous to his going off with his workmen on account of thofe repara¬ tions the danger was intimated to him and it was faid, that one day or other the lighthoufe would certainly be overfeU To this he replied, “ He was fo well affured of the ftrength of his building, he fhould only with to be there in the greateft ftorm that ever blew under the face of the heavens, that he might fee what effefl it would have upon the ftruflure.” “ In this wifh he was foon gratified j for while he was there with his workmen and light-keepers, that dreadful ftorm began which raged the moft violently upon the 26th November 1703, in the night ; and of all the accounts of the kind which hiftory furnifhes us with, we have none that has exceeded this in Great Britain, or was more injurious or extenfive in its deva- ilation",Plymouth,US,5,United States,North America

In fcripture, we find it moft generally named Mifraim ; though in the PfalmS it is ftyled the land of Ham.—To us it is beft known by the name Egypt, the etymology of which is more uncertain.—Some derive it from JEgyptus, a fuppofed king of the country ; others fay it fignifies no more than “ the land of the Copts j4ia in Greek figni- fying a country, and JEcoptos being eafily foftened into JEgypti/s.—The moft probable opinion, however, feems to be, that it received its name from the blacknefs of its foil, and the dark colour both of its river and inha¬ bitants : for fuch a blackilh colour is by the Greeks called crgyptios, from gyps, and cegyps “ a vulture 5” and by the Latins fubvulturius.

"After an unknown interval of time from this mo¬ narch, reigned Sefoftris. He was the firft great war¬ rior whofe conquefts are recorded with any degree of diftin&nefs. In what age of the world he lived, is uncertain. Some chronologers, among whom is Sir Ifaac Newton, are of opinion, that he is the Sefac or Shifhak, who took Jerufalem in the reign of Re- hoboam the fon of Solomon. Others, however, place him much earlier; and Mr Whifton will have him to be the Pharaoh who refufed to part with the If- raelites, and was at laft drowned in the Red fea. Mr Bryant endeavours to prove that no fuch perfon ever exilted ; but that in his hiftory, as well as that of many ancient heroes, we have an abridgement of that of the Cufhites or Babylonians, who fpread themfelves over great part of the then known world, and everywhere brought the people in fubjeflion to them. His reign is reckoned the raoft extraordinary part of the Egyp¬ tian hiftory ; and the following feems to be the leaft fabulous account that can be got of it. The father of Sefoftris was told in a dream, by the god Vulcan, that his fon, who was then newly born, or perhaps ftill unborn, fhould be lord of the whole earth. His fa¬ ther, upon the credit of this vifion, got together all the males in the land of Egypt that were born on the fame day with Sefofiris; appointed nurfes and pro¬ per perfons to take care of them, and had them treat¬ ed like his own child ; being perluaded that they who had been the conltant companions of his youth would prove the moft faithful minirters and fiddlers. As they grew up, they were inured to laborious exercifes ; and, in particular, were never permitted to tafte any food till they had performed a courfe of 180 furlongs, upwards of 22 of our miles. When the old king ima¬ gined they were fufficiently educated in the martial way he defigned them to follow, they were fent by way of trial of their abilities againft the Arabians. In this expedition Sefoftris proved fuccefsful, and in the end fubdued that people who had never before been con¬ quered. He was fent to the we ft ward, and conquered the greateft part of Africa ; nor could he be flopped in his career till lie arrived at the Atlantic ocean","Bryant, Vulcan","EG,US,RO",5,"Egypt,United States,Romania","Africa,North America,Europe"
"He crofled the Ganges, and eredled pillars on its banks ; and from thence he is faid to have marched eaft ward to the very extremity of the Afiatic conti¬ nent. Returning from thence, he invaded the Scy¬ thians and Thracians \ but all authors do not agree that he conquered them. Some even affirm, that he was overthrown by them with great flaughter, and ob¬ liged to abandon a great part of his booty and mili¬ tary ftores. But whether he had good or bad fuc- cefs in thefe parts, it is a common opinion that he fettled a colony in Colchis. Herodotus, however, who gives the moft particular account of the conquefts of this monarch, does not fay whether the colony was de- fignedly planted by Sefoftris : or whether part of his army loitered behind the reft, and took up their refi- dence in that region. From his own knowledge, he af- ferts, that the inhabitants of that country were undoubt¬ edly of Egyptian defcent. This was evident from the perfonal refemblance they bore to the Egyptians, who were fvvarthy complexioned and frizzle haired; but more efpecially from the conformity of their cuftoms, par¬ ticularly circumcifion. ' The utmoft boundary of this mighty monarch’s con¬ quefts, however, was in the country of Thrace ; for beyond this country his pillars were nowhere to be feen. Thefe pillars he was accuftomed to fet up in every country which he conquered, with the following 1 infcription, or one to the fame purpofe : “ Sefoftris, kings of kings, and lords of lords, fubdued this country by the power of his arms ” Befides thefe, he left alfo ilatues of himfelf; two of which, according to Hero¬ dotus, were to be feen in his time j the one on the road between Ephefus and Phocaea, and the other be¬ tween Smyrna and Sardis : they were armed after the Ethiopian and Egyptian manner j holding a javelin in one hand and a bow in the other.

"the world unfiniftied, were the want of provifions for his army, and the difficulty of the pafles. Moft pro¬ bably, however, his return was haftened by the intelli¬ gence he received from the high pried of Egypt, con¬ cerning the rebellious proceedings of his brother j who, encouraged by his long abfence, bad alfumed the dia¬ dem, violated the queen, and alfo the royal concu¬ bines. On receiving this news, Sefoftris haftened from Thrace •, and at the end of nine years came to Pelu- fmm in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the fpoils of Alia. The treacherous bro¬ ther met him at this city ; and it is faid, with very little probability, that Sefoftris accepted of an invita¬ tion to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the reft of the royal family. During the continuance of the enter¬ tainment, Armais caufed a great quantity of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to deep j and as foon as they were retired to reft fet fire to the reeds. Sefoftris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of affifting him, ruffled through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thankf- giving for this wonderful deliverance, he made feveral donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire. He then took vengeance on his brother Armais, faid to be the Danaus of the Greeks, who, being on this occafion driven out of Egypt, withdrew into Greece. ^ Sefoftris now laid afide all thoughts of war, and ap-jiisgre; plied himfelf wholly to fuch works as might tend to works, the public good, and his own future reputation. In or¬ der to prevent the incurfions of the Syrians and Ara¬ bians, he fortified the eaft fide of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelufium through the defert to Helio¬ polis, for 1874 miles. He raifed alfo an incredible number of vaft and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed fuch towns as had before been fituated too low, in order to fecure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the fea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile j and not only made an eafier communication between different places, but rendered the country in a great meafure im- paffable to an enemy. He eredled a temple in every city in Egypt, and dedicated it to the fupreme deity of the place j but in the courfe of fuch a great under¬ taking as this neceffarily muft have been, he took care not to employ any of his Egyptian fubjefts. 'Ihus he fecured their aftedlion, and employed the vaft multi¬ tude of captives he had brought along with him ; and to perpetuate the memory of a tranfaflion fo remark¬ able, he caufed to be infcribed on all thefe temples, “ No one native laboured hereon.” In the city of Memphis, before the temple of Vulcan, he raifed fix gigantic ftatues, each of one (lone.

"After the death of Sefoftris, we meet with another chafm of an indeterminate length in the Egyptian hiftory. It concludes with the reign of Amafis or Am- mofis ; who being a tyrant, his fubjecls joined A£ti- fanes the king of Ethiopia to drive him out.—Thus A&ifanes became mailer of the kingdom ; and after his death follows another chafm in the hiftory, during which the empire is faid to have been in a ftate of anarchy for five generations.—This period brings us down to the times of the Trojan war. The reigning prince in Egypt was at that time called Cetes ; by the Greeks, Proteus. The priefts reported that he was a magician 5 and that he could affume any lhape he t fable ofeven that of fire.

"The rapid fuccefs of the Perfians ftruck with fuch terror the Libyans, Cyreneans, Barcseans, and other dependents or allies of the Egyptian monarch, that they immediately fubmitted. Nothing now remained bur to difpofe of the captive king, and revenge on him and his fubjefls the cruelties which they had commit¬ ted. This the mercilefs vidflor executed in the fevereft manner. On the 10th day after Memphis had been taken, Pfammenitus and the chief of the Egyptian no¬ bility were ignominioufly fent into one of the fuburbs of that city. The king being there feated in a pro¬ per place, faw his daughter coming along in the habit of a-poor flave with a pitcher to fetch water from the river, and followed by the daughters of the greateft families in Egypt, all in the fame miferable garb, with pitchers in their hands, drowned in tears, and loudly bemoaning their miferable fituation. When the fathers faw their daughters in this diftrefs, they burft into tears, all but Pfammenitus, who only caft his eyes on the ground and kept them fixed there. After the young women, came the fon of Pfammenitus, with 2000 of the young nobility, all of them with bits in their mouths and halters round their necks, led to execution. This was done to expiate the murder of the Perfian herald and the Mitylenean failors ; for Cambyfes caufed ten Egyptians of the firft rank to be publicly executed for every one of thofe that had been flain. Pfammenitus, however, obferved the fame conduft as before, keep¬ ing his eyes ftedfaftly fixed on the ground, though all the Egyptians around him made the loudeft lamenta¬ tions. A little after this he faw an intimate friend and companion, now advanced in years, who having been plundered of all he had, was begging his bread from door to door in the fuburbs. As foon as he faw this man, Pfammenitus wept bitterly *, and calling out to him by his name, ftruck himfelf on the head as if be had been frantic.

"Extraordi- During the reign of Philopater happened a very ex- nary ftory traordinary event with regard to the Jews, which is the raenti°ned in the Maccabees*. The king of Egypt, * Lib iii. 2. while his Syrian expedition, had attempted to en- 3, 4, 5. ter the temple of Jeruialem ; but being hindered by the Jews, he was filled with the utmoft rage againft the whole nation. On his return to Alexandria, he refolved to make thofe who dwelt in that city feel the firft effects of his vengeance. He began with publifh- ing a decree, which he caufed to be engraved on a pillar eredfed for that purpofe at the gate of his palace, ex¬ cluding all thofe who did not facrifice to the gods wor- ftiipned by the king. By this means the Jews were debarred from fuing to him for juftice, or obtaining his prote£l:ion when they happened to ftand in need of it. By the favour of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Soter, and Euergetes, the Jews enjoyed at Alexandria the fame privileges with the Macedonians. In that metropolis the inhabitants were divided into three ranks or claffes. In the firft were the Macedonians, the original founders of the city, and along with them were enrolled the Jews ; in the fecond were the mer¬ cenaries who had ferved under Alexander 5 and in the third the native Egyptians. Ptolemy now, to be revenged of the Jews, ordered, by another decree, that they ftiould be degraded from the firft rank, and enrolled among the native Egyptians. By the fame decree it was ena&ed, that all of that nation fliould ap¬ pear at an appointed time before the proper officers, in order to be enrolled among the common people; that at the time of their enrollment they ffiould have the mark of an ivy leaf, the badge of Bacchus, imprefled with a hot iron on their faces ; that all who were thus marked ftiould be made flaves ; and, laftly, that if any one ftiould ftand out againft this decree, he ftiould be immediately put to death.

But in order to underftand this, we mult confider the way in which the race of Mamlouks is continued or multiplied in Egypt. This is not in the ordinary way, by marriage : on the contrary, M.

From the time of the Moguls this commerce has been continued on the banks of the Cuban and Phafis in the fame manner as it is carried on in Africa, by the wars among the ho- ilile tribes, and the mifery or avarice of the inhabi¬ tants, who fell their children to ftrangers.

"In E G Y [ 617 ] E G Y t In thofe early ages where hiftory has not fixed any epoch, a certain people defcended from the mountains near the catarafts into the valley overflowed by the Nile, and which w'as then an uninhabitable morafs overgrown with reeds and canes. In what manner, or from what motive, thefe people were induced to defcend from their ancient habitations to fuch a place, or how they found means to penetrate into a morafs which he exprefsly tells us was impenetrable, we are not informed, neither is it to our prefent purpofe to inquire. At that time, however, the fea bathed the feet of thofe mountains where the pyramids are built, and advanced far into Libya. It covered alfo part of the ifthmus of Suez, and every part of what we now call the Delta formed a great gulf. After many ages the Egyptians, by what means is unknown, at leait not fpecified by our author (though they ought to have been fo, as the country it feems was then overflowed not only by the river but by the ocean), formed canals to carry off the ftagnant waters of the Nile j oppofed ftrong dykes to its ravages j and, tired of dwelling in the caverns of rocks, built towns and cities upon (pots elevated either by nature or art. Already the river was kept within its bounds, the habitations of men were out of the reach of its inundations, and experience had taught the peo¬ ple to forefee and announce them. One of the kings of Egypt undertook to change the courfe of the river","Suez, Delta","EG,LY,CA",5,"Egypt,Libya,Canada","Africa,Africa,North America"
"After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an unfarmountable obftacle to the right, it turned fuddenly to the left j and taking its courfe to the fouthward of Memphis, it fpread its waters through the fands of Libya. The prince we fpeak of caufed a new bed to be dug for it to the eaft of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and difcharge itfelf into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the caftle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was flill to be feen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day acrofs the deferts, pafling to the weft- ward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs ftill beftow upon it the name of Bahr Be/ama, “ or fea without wa¬ ter,” and it is now almoft choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A reflux of the fea was occafioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themfelves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the fands and mud carried along with them were colledled into heaps ; and thus the Delta, at firft very inconfiderable, rofe out of the fea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has fince been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raifing dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to He¬ rodotus, the Delta was in its infancy ; eight cubits of water being then fufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats paffed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial emi¬ nences, refembled the iflands of the Egean fea. At the time that Herodotus vifited this country, 15 cubits ■were neceffary to cover all the Lower Egypt ; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the fpace of two days journey to the right and left of the ifland.

Sometimes, s—-y--— however, the Nile rifes to 22 cubits ; and the caufe of this phenomenon is the mud for fo many years accu¬ mulated on the ifland. Here, in the fpace of 3284 years, we fee the Delta elevated 14 cubits. Our author wrote in 1777, and informs us that he twice made the tour of the ifland during the time of the inundation","Cairo, Delta","EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"“ The river (fays he) flowed in full ftreams in the great branches of Rofetta and Damietta, as well as in thofe which pafs through the interior part of the country ; but it did not overflow the lands, except in the lower parts, where the dykes were pierced for the purpofe of watering the plantations of rice. We muft not, how¬ ever, imagine, as feveral travellers pretend, that this ifland will continue to rife, and that it will become un¬ fruitful. As it owes its increafe to the annual fettling of the mud conveyed thither by the Nile, when itceafes to be overflowed it will no longer increafe in height, for it is demonftrated that culture is not fufficient to raife land. ** “ It is natural to imagine that the Delta has in- creafed in length as well as in height; and of this we may look upon the following faft to be a remarkable proof. Under the reign of Pfammiticus, the Mile- fians, with 30 veffels, landed at the mouth of the Bol- bitine branch of the Nile, now called that of Rojetta, where they fortified themfelves. There they built a town called Metelis, the fame as Faoiie, which, in the Coptic vocabularies, has preferved the name of MeJJil","Damietta, Delta","EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"This town, formerly a fea-port, is now nine leagues diftant from the fea ; all which fpace the Delta has in- creafed in length from the time of Pfammiticus to the prefent. Homer, in his Odyffey, puts the following words in the mouth of Menelaus. ‘ In the ftormy fea which wafhes Egypt there is an ifland called Pharos",Delta,"EG,CA",5,"Egypt,Canada","Africa,North America"
"“ What prodigious changes great rivers occafion on the furface of the globe ! How they elevate, at their mouths, iflands which become at length large portions of the continent! It is thus that the Nile has formed almoft all the Lower Egypt, and created out of the waters the Delta, which is 90 leagues in circumfe¬ rence. It is thus that the Meander, conftantly repel¬ ling the waves of the Mediterranean, and gradually fill¬ ing up the gulf into which it falls, has placed in the middle of the land the town of Miletus, formerly a ce¬ lebrated harbour. It is thus that the Tigris and the Euphrates, let loofe from the Armenian hills, and fweeping with them in their eourfe the fands of Me- fopotamia, are imperceptibly filling up the Perfian gulf.” 130 Thefe are the reafons afligned by M. Savary forBruce’s thinking that the Delta, as well as the greateft part uf r®afon5 the Lower Egypt, had been produced by the Nile ;[r^rC<^j but this opinion is violently contefted by othernion","Delta, Delta","CA,AM",5,"Canada,Armenia","North America,Asia"

Mr Bruce, however, has treated the fubjedt with much greater accuracy. He obferves, that from the fituation of Canopus, the dillance betwixt Egypt and Cyprus, and the extenfion of the land to the north¬ ward, it appears that no addition of any confequence had been made to it for 3000 years part. The only argument left for the increafe of land therefore muft be taken from the nilometer. The ufe of this inftrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that fo it might be known whether the crop would be fufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exadted of them by the fovereign or not. The firft ftep was to know what fpace of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by menfuration, the next thing was to afcertain the produce of the ground upon an average. Thus becoming acquainted with the greateft and leaft crops produced, together with the exadl extent of ground overflowed, they were furnifh- ed with all the neceflary principles for conftru&ing a nilometer ; and nothing now remained but to eredl a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exadfly into cu¬ bits. This was accordingly done ; the pillar was firft divided into cubits, and thefe again were fubdivided into digits. The firft divifion of this kind was un¬ doubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man ; being the length of the arm from the middle of the round bone in the elbow to the point of the middle finger ; a meafure ftill in ufe among all rude nations. As no ftandard could be found by which this meafure might be exa&ly determined, authors have dif¬ fered very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and of an inch ; the other one foot and of a foot ; but Mr Bruce is of opinion' that both of thefe are too large. He found, by menfuration, the Egyptian cubit to be ex¬ actly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch ; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit ufed for determining the increafe of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increafe was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed ; but that in his time 16 or at leaft 15 cubits were neceffary to produce the fame eff-ft:. But to this account Mr Bruce obje&s, that Herodotus could have no certain information con¬ cerning the nilometer, becaufe he himfelf fays that the priefts, who alone had accefs to it, would tell him no¬ thing of the matter. Herodotus alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation ; and this fuperfluous quantity Mr Bruce fuppofes to have been conveyed in¬ to the defert for the ufe of the Arabs, and that by fuch a vaft drain the rile of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminilhed. But even granting that there was fuch a difference between the rife of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Hero¬ dotus, it does not appear that anv thing like it has appeared ever lince. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 9 ] E G Y 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that Egypt; eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in v the time of Moeris. From fome paffages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exer¬ tion of induftry to caufe this quantity of water pro¬ duce a plentiful crop ; but there is not the leaft reaion to fuppofe, that the very fame induftry was not ne¬ ceffary in the time of Moeris ; fo that ftill there is not any increafe of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian vifited Egypt, we are informed from unqueftionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the ftandard; both which accounts correfpond with that of Herodo¬ tus. Laftly, Procopius, who lived in the time of Jul* tinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requifite for a minimum. # # 13a From thefe accounts, fo various and difcordant, it is No increafe obvious that no certain conclufion can be drawn. ^ is not indeed eafy to determine the reafon of this dif- ^eafon- ference in point of fa£l. 1 he only conje&ure we can ^ fup* offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a fmafter pofed; quantity of water will anfwer the purpofe of producing a plentiful crop, fo it is not unreafonable to fuppofe that at different periods the induftry of the people has varied fo much as to occafion the difagreement in que- ftion. This would undoubtedly depend very much upon their governor ; and indeed Strabo informs us that it was by the care of the governor Petronius, that fuch a final 1 quantity of water was made to anfwer the purpofe","Roman, Memphis, Adrian","EG,US,CY,RO,GR",5,"Egypt,United States,Cyprus,Romania,Greece","Africa,North America,Asia,Europe,Europe"
"The conclufion drawn by Mr Bruce from the whole of the accounts above related, is, that from them it is moft probable that no increafe of land has been indicated by the nilometer from the time of Moeris to that of Jufti- nian. _ *35 On the conqueft of Egypt by the Saracens, their1™*111 barbarous and ftupid caliph deftroyed the nilometer,” caufing another to be built in its ftead, and afterwards fixed the ftandard of paying tribute confiderably below what it had ufually been. The Egyptians were thus kept in continual terror, and conftantly watched the new nilometer to obferve the gradual increafe or de- creafe of the water. On this he ordered the new nilo¬ meter to be deftroyed, and another to be conftru&ed, and aft accefs to it to be denied to the people. Which prohibition is ftill continued to Chriftians; though our author found means to get over this obftacle, and has given a figure of the inftrument itfelf. That the people might not, however, be fuppofed to remain in total ig¬ norance of their fituation, he commanded a proclamation to be daily made concerning the height of the water, but in fuch an unintelligble manner that nobody was made any wifer ; nor, according to our author, is the proclamation underftood at this day. From his own ob- fervations, however, Mr Bruce concludes, that 15 cubits are now the minimum of inundation, and as this coin¬ cides with the accounts of it in the times of Herodotus and Adrian, he fuppofes with great probability, that the fame quantity of water has been neceffary to over¬ flow this country from the earlieft accounts to the pre¬ fect time",Adrian,"EG,US",5,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"E G Y [ 620 ] E G Y Egypt. With regard to his other affertions concerning the city '“""—■v—of Metelis having been once a fea port, M. Volney proves M Sava ^aS Strabo unfairly, and consequently no rv’s opinion ftrefs is to be laid uPon ^em. The principal, indeed concerning the only, evidence which therefore remains, is the palfage the ifle ot already quoted from Homer, viz. that “ the illand of Pharos re- Pharos Js as far ditlant from one of the mouths of the Volney 1 * as a ve^el can one ^ay before the wind.” “ But (fays M. Volney) wThen Homer fpeaks of the diftance of this ifland, he does not mean its diflance from the (bore oppofite, as that traveller (M. Savary) has tranflated him, but from the land of Egypt and the river Nile. In the fecond place, by a day’s fail we mull not underftand that indefinite fpace which the veffels, or rather the boats of the ancient Greeks, could pafs through in a day $ but an accurate and determined meafure of 540 ftadia. This meafure is afcertained by Herodotus, and is the precife diftance between Pharos and the Nile, allowing, with M. d’Anville, 27,000 toifes to 540 Itadia. It is therefore far from being proved, that the increafe of the Delta or of the continent was fo rapid as has been reprefented ; and, if we were difpofed to maintain it, we Humid Hill have to explain how this fhore, which has not gained half a league from the days of Alexander, (hould have gained eleven in the far fhorter period from the time of Menelaus to that conqueror. The utmoft extent of the encroachment of this land upon the fea, however, may be learned from the words of Herodotus ; who informs us, that “ the breadth of Egypt, along the fea coall, from the gulf of Plin- thine to the lake Serbonis near Mount Cafius, is 3600 ftadia ; and its length from the fea to Heliopolis 1500 ftadia.” Allowing therefore the ftadium of Herodotus to be between 50 and 51 French toifes, the 1500 ftadia juft mentioned are equal to 76,000 toifes j which, at the rate of 57,000 to a degree, gives one degree and near 20 minutes and a half. But from the aftronomical obferva- tions of M. Niebuhr, who travelled for the king of Den¬ mark in 1761, the difference of latitude between Helio¬ polis, now called Alatarea, and the fea, being one degree 29 minutes at Damietta, and one degree 24 minutes at Rofetta, there is a difference on one fide of three minutes and a half, or a league and a half encroachment; and eight minutes and a half, or three leagues and a half, on the other.” Thus the difpute concerning the augmentation of the land of Egypt by the Nile feems to be abfolutely decid¬ ed } and the encroachments of it on the fea fo trifling, that we may juftly doubt whether they exift, or whether we are not entirely to attribute the apparent differences to thofe which certainly take place betwixt the ancient and modern menfuration. M. Volney gives a very par¬ ticular defcription of the face of the country $ but takes notice of the inconveniences under which travellers la¬ bour in this country, by which it is rendered extremely difficult to fay any thing certain with regard to the na¬ ture of the foil or mineral produflions. Thefe arife from the barbarity and fuperftition ©f the people, who imagine all the Europeans to be magicians and forcerers, who come by their magic art to difcover the treafures which the genii have concealed under the ruins.

"A large proportion of the land formerly watered by the branches of the Nile, anciently denoted the Pelu- fiac, Tanitic, and Mendefian branches, is now the bed of Lake Menzaleh. Lake Bourlos is not far from the mouth of what was formerly called the Sebennitic branch, and Lake Maadieh is near the mouth of the ancient Canopic. Lake Mareotis was at. too great a diftance from the Nile to be filled up with the mud which it depofits, the waters of which were diverted from the lake, by a canal which had been cut .for the conveyance of water to the city of Alexandria j and having no communication with the fea, its waters of confequence were gradually evaporated. It ftill, how¬ ever, contained a moving fand and a brackifti mud, which receiving the rain in winter, and a fmall portion of the waters from the Nile by the canals of Bahireh, it exhibits the appearance of a mar(h during the greater part of the year. There are alfo a few lakes which owe their origin to the redundant waters of the Nile, diffu- fing themfelves over hollow places in which they are confined, and only difappear by the gradual procefs of evaporation",Alexandria,US,5,United States,North America

"F. Sicard mentions two lakes, from the water of which is produced annually a great quantity of fait containing much mineral alkali : and M. Volney in¬ forms us, that the whole foil of this country is impreg¬ nated with fait; fo that, upon digging to fome depth in the ground we always meet with brackilh water im¬ pregnated in fome degree with the mineral alkali as well as with common fait. The two lakes mentioned by Sicard are fituated in the defert to the weft of the Delta •, and are three or four leagues in length, and about a quarter of a league in breadth, with a (olid and ftony bottom. For nine months in the year they are without water ; but in the winter time there oozes out of the earth a reddith violet coloured water, which fills the lakes to the height of five or fix feet. This being evaporated by the return of the heat, there remains a bed of fait two feet thick and very hard, which is bro¬ ken in pieces with iron bars ; and no lefs than 30,000 quintals are procured every year from thefe lakes. So great is the propenfity of the Egyptian foil to produce fait, that even when the gardens are overflowed for the fake of watering them, the furface of the ground, af¬ ter the evaporation and abforption of the water, ap¬ pears glazed over with fait. I he water found in the wells contains mineral alkali, marine fait, and a little nitre. M. Volney is of opinion, that the fertile mould of Egvpt, which is of a blackifh colour, differs effen- tially from that of the other parts } and is derived frorn the internal parts of Ethiopia along with the waters of the Nile. This feema to contradift what he had before advanced againft M. Savary concerning the increafe of the land of Egypt by means of the w’aters of this river: but there is no reafon at all to fuppofe this kind of earth to be of a foreign origin •, it being always the refult of vegetation and cultivation. Even the moft barren and fandy fpots in the world, if properly water- ] E G Y ed, and fuch vegetables planted in them as would grow Egypt, there, in time would be covered with this black earth ' 'f~mm as well as others : and of this kind of artificial formation of foil, travellers give us a remarkable initance in the garden of the monks at Mount Sinai, where the country is naturally as barren as in any place of the world",Delta,"EG,ET,CA",5,"Egypt,Ethiopia,Canada","Africa,Africa,North America"
"Waihed on the cart and weft by two rivers formed by the divifion of the Nile, each of which is as large and more deep than the Loire, interfered by innumerable rivulet* •, it prefents to the eye an immenfe garden, all the different compartments of which may be eafily watered. During the three months that the Thebais is under water, the Delta poffeffes fields covered with rice, barley, vegetables, and winter fruits. It is alio the only part of Egypt where the fame field produces two crops of grain within the year, the one of rice, the other of barley.” The only caufe of all this fertility is the Nile, with¬ out which the whole country would foon become an un¬ inhabitable defert, as rain falls very feldom in this part of the world. It flows with a very gentle ftream through the flat country, and its waters are very muddy, fo that they mult have time to fettle, or even require filtration ^ before they can be drunk. For purifying the water, tviett70a 0f the Egyptians, according to M. Volney, ufe bitter purifying almonds, with which they rub the veffel containing it, cooling and then the water becomes light and good •, but on what principle this ingredient aits we cannot pretend to determine.

During the time of the inundation a certain vor-'''1’'051 tical motion of the waters takes place: but notwith-watens Handing this, the Nile is fo eafily managed, that many fields lower than the furface of its waters are preferved from injury merely by a dam of moiftened earth not more than eight or ten inches in thicknefs. This me¬ thod is made ufe of particularly in the Delta when it is threatened with a flood",Delta,CA,5,Canada,North America
"As the Nile does not always rife to a height fuffi- cient for the purpofes of agriculture, the former fove- reigns of Egypt were at vaft pains to cut proper ca¬ nals in order to fupply the deficiency. Some of thefe are ftill preferved, but great numbers are rendered ufe- lefs through the indolence or barbarity of their fuccef- fors. Thofe which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are bell taken care of by government. The laft is watched by an officer appointed for that purpofe, whofe office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bachria, who receive this fuper- fluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increafe of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by thofe who derive advantage fiom them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the pro¬ vince of Sharkia ; which, making part of the ifthmus of Suez, is the molt confiderable of Egypt, and the moft capable of a great increafe of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are pofieffed by the Arabs, would be no lefs fertile, were it not for the exceffive inclination thefe people have to deftroy, fo that they make war even with the fpontaneous prodtnftions oftheeaith. A number of other canals run through the Delta ; and the veftiges of thofe which watered the provinces to the eaftward and weft ward, (how that in former times thefe were the beft cultivated parts of Egypt. “ We may alfo prefume (fays the baron de Tott), from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the conftru&ion of the canal, and the natural level of the lands which encompafs the lake Mareotis, and extend themfelves weft ward to the kingdom of Barca, that this country, at prefent given up to the Arabs, and almoft defert, was once fufficiently rich in productions of every kind to furnifh the city of Alexander with its whole fubfiftence.” I The air and climate of Egypt are extremely hot,AjrXa^ not only from the height of the fun, which in fummerclimate approaches to the zenith, but from the w'ant of rain and Egypt* from the vicinity of thofe burning and fandy deferts which lie to the fouthward. In the months of July and Auguft, according to M. Volney, Reaumur’s thermo¬ meter (lands, even in the moft temperate apartments, at the height of 24 or 25 degrees above the freezing point ; and in the fouthern parts it is faid to rife ftill higher. Hence, he fays, only two feafons (hould be diftinguiftied in Egypt, the cool and the hot, or fpring and fummer. The latter continues for the greateft part of E G Y oF the year, viz. from March to November or even ■Monger : for by the end of February the fun is intoler¬ able to a European at nine o’clock in the morning","Cairo, Alexandria, Alexandria, Cairo, Damietta, Suez, Gaza, Delta, Alexandria, March","EG,US,PS,CA,GB",5,"Egypt,United States,Palestine, State of,Canada,United Kingdom","Africa,North America,Asia,North America,Europe"
"But this is by no means the cafe. The great drynefs of the air makes itabforh vapours of all kinds with the utmod avidity j and thefe rifing to a great height, are carried off by the winds either to the fouthward or northward, without having time to communicate anv of their pernicious effe&s. This drynefs is fo remark¬ able in the internal parts of the country, that defn meat expofed to the open air does not putrefy even in fum¬ mer, but foot) becomes hard and dry like wood. In the deferts there are frequently dead carcafes thus dried in filch a manner, and become fo light, that one may ea- fny lift that of a camel with one hand. In the mari¬ time parts, however, this dryntfs of the air is not to be expeCIed. They difcover the fame degree of moidure which ufually attends fuch fituations. At Rofetta and Alexandria, iron cannot be expofed to the air for 24 hours without ruding. According to M. Volnev, the air of Egypt is alfo flrongly impregnated with falts: for which opinion he gives the following reafon : “ The dones are corroded by natrum (mineral alkali or foda), and in moid places long crydallifcations of it are to be found, which might be taken for faltpetre. The wall of the lefuits garden at Cairo, built with earth and bricks, is everywhere covered with a erud of this natrum as thick as a crown piece : and when this garden has been overflowed by the waters of the kalidj (canal), the ground, after they have drained off, appears fparkling on every fide with crydals, which certainly wete not brought thither by the water, as it diows no fign of fait either to the tade or by didillation.”—But what¬ ever may be the quantity of fait contained in the earth, it is certain that M. Volney’s opinion of its coming thi¬ ther from the air cannot be jud. The fait in quedion is excedively fixed, and cannot be didipated into the air without the violent heat of a glafshoufe furnace •, and even after this has been done, it will not remain diffuf- ed through the atmofphere, but quickly falls back again","Alexandria, Cairo","EG,US",5,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"
"By reafon of the great drynefs of the air, Egypt is exempted from the phenomena of rain, hail, fnow, thunder, and lightning. Earthquakes are alfo feldom heard of in this country; though fometimes they have been very fatal and deltruflive, particularly one in the year 1112. In the Delta it never rains in fummer, and very feldom at any other time. In 1761, however, fuch a quantity of rain unexpe&edly fell, that a great number of houfes, built with mud walls, tumbled entire¬ ly down by being foaked with the water, to which they were unaccudomed. In the Higher Egypt the rain is dill led frequent ; but the people, fenfible of the advantages which accrue from it, always rejoice when any falls, however infufficient to anfwer the pur- 14a pofe.

Mr Bruce had an opportunity of afeer- taining this fa£b in the month of June 1768 ; for at that time, while on a vovag«- from Sidon to Alexandria, he obferved great numbers of thin white clouds moving rapidly from the fouth, and in diredl oppofition to the Etefian winds","Sidon, Alexandria","LB,US",5,"Lebanon,United States","Asia,North America"

M. Volney, from a view of the fphynx, and finding its features to be fuch as is juft now deferibed, concludes, that the ancient E- gyptians were real negroes j which he thinks is likewife confirmed by a paffage in Herodotus, where he con¬ cludes, that the inhabitants of Colchis were defcended from the Egyptians, “ on account of the blacknefs of their fkins and frizzled hair.” M. Volney alfo re¬ marks, that the countenance of the negroes is fuch as exadtly reprefents that ftate of contraction aflumed by our faces when ftrongly affefted by heat. The eye-brows are knit, the cheeks rile, the eye lids are contracted, and the mouth diftorted; and this ftate of contraction to which the features of the negroes are perpetually expofed in the hot climates they in¬ habit, is become particularly charaCteriftic. Excef- five cold and fnow produces the lame effcCt 5 and hence this kind of countenance is alfo common among the Tartars j while, in the temperate climates, the features are proportionably lengthened, and the whole counte¬ nance expanded",Delta,"CA,GR,EG",5,"Canada,Greece,Egypt","North America,Europe,Africa"
"Though the climate of Egypt is far from being un¬ healthy ; yet there arc not a few difeafes which feem to be peculiar to it, and to have their origin either from the conflitution of the atmofphere, or the manner of living of the inhabitants. One of thefe till lately has been fuppofed to be the plague j which opinion we find fupported by Dr Mead, who has endeavoured to affign a natural reafon why it fliould take its origin in this country. But it is now univerfally agreed, that the plague never originates in the interior parts of Egypt, but always begins at Alexandria, paffing fuc- ceffively from thence to Rofetta, Cairo, Damietta, and the reft of the Delta. It is likewife obferved, that its appearance is always preceded by the arrival of fome veffel from Smyrna or Conftantinople j and that if the plague has been very violent in either of thefe cities, the danger of Egypt is the greater. On proper in¬ quiry, it is found to be really a native of Conftantinople j from whence it is exported by the abfurd negligence of the Turks, who refufe to take any care to prevent the fpreading of the infeflion. As they fell even the clothes of the dead without the lealt ceremony, and fhips laden with this pernicious commodity are fent to Alexandria, it is no wonder that it ffiould foon make its appearance there.

"' ^  E L A [ 638 ] E L A Jng po\Ver of elafticity in vapour, feemingly fo little ca¬ pable of accomplilhing any great purpofe when in an unconfined date. As air is that fluid in which, from the many experiments made upon it by the air-pump and otherwife, the elaftic property has moll frequently been obferved, the refearches of philofophers were at firft principally directed towards it. The eaufes they affigned, however, were very inadequate ; being found¬ ed upon an hypothefis concerning the form of the par¬ ticles of the atmofphere itfelf, which they fuppofed to be either rolled up like the fprings of watches, or that they confifted of a kind of elaftic flakes. This was followed by another hypothefis concerning their fub- ftance, which was imagined to be perfedlly elaftic, and fo ftrong that they could not be broken by any me¬ chanical power whatever ; and thus they thought the phenomenon of the elafticity of the air might be ex¬ plained. But an infuperable difficulty ftill attended their fcheme, notwithftanding both thefe fuppofitions : for it was obferved, that the elaftic power of the air was augmented not only in proportion to the quantity of preffure it was made to endure, but in proportion to the degree of heat applied to it at the time. Sir Ifaac Newton was aware of this difficulty ; and juftly con¬ cluded, that the phenomena of the air’s elafticity could not be folved on any other fuppofition but that of a repulfive power diffufed all around each of its parti¬ cles, which became ftronger as they approached, and weaker as they removed from each other. Hence the common phenomena of the air-pump and condenfing- engine received a fatisfaftory explanation ; but ftill it remained to account for the. power fhown in the pre- fent cafe by heat, as it could not be denied that this element had a very great ffiare in augmenting the ela- fticity of the atmofphere, and feemed to be the only caufe of elafticity in other vapours. It does not ap¬ pear that Sir Ifaac entered into this queftion, but con¬ tented himfelf with attributing to heat the property of increafing repulfion, and afcribing this to another un¬ explored property called rarefahion. Thus matters flood till the great difcovery made by Dr Black, that fome bodies have the power of abforbing in an un¬ known manner the element in queftion, and parting with it afterwards, fo that it flows out of the body which had ablbrbed it with the very fame properties that it had before abforption. Hence many pheno¬ mena of heat, vapour, and evaporation, were explained in a manner much more fatisfaftory than had ever been attempted or even expe&ed before. One of thefe w'as that remarkable property of metals becoming hot by hammering ; during which operation, in the Dolor’s opinion, the element of heat is fqueezed out from be¬ tween the particles of the metal, as water is from the pores of a fponge by preffing it between the fingers",Newton,US,5,United States,North America

This bar w7as heated by a fpirit lamp, fo that the increafe or de- creafe of heat in the tourmalin could thus be exaClly determined. In this fituation he obferved, that when¬ ever he examined the tourmalin, the glafs had acquired an eleClricity contrary to that fide of the done which lay upon it, and equally drong with it. If, for ex¬ ample, the flat fide of the done had been prefented to a feather eleClrified pofitively, as the heat was increa- fing, it would repel it at the didance of about two inch¬ es, and the glafs would attraCl it at the fame or a greater difiance ; and when the heat was decreafing, the done would attraCl, and the glafs repel it at the didance of four or five inches. The cafe was the fame whichever of the fides was prefented, as well as when a diilling was fadened with fealing-jvax upon the glafs; the eleClricity both of the fliilling and glafs being al¬ ways oppofite to that of the done.

"This idea of electric atmofpheres was firft held at a very early period of the fcience by Otto Guericke, and afterwards by the academicians del Cimento, who con¬ trived to render the electric atmofphere vifible, by means of fmoke attracted by, and uniting itfelf to a piece of am¬ ber, and gently rifing from it, and vaniftiing as the am¬ ber cooled. But Dr Franklin exhibited this electric atmofphere with great advantage, by dropping rofin on hot iron plates held under bodies electrified, from which the fmoke rofe and encompaffed the bodies, giv¬ ing them a very beautiful appearance. He made other obfervations on thofe atmofpheres : he took notice that they and the air did not feem to exclude one another j that they were immoveably retained by the bodies from which they iffued ; and that the fame body, in different circumftances of dilatation and contraction, is capable of receiving and retaining more or lefs of the electric fluid on its furface.

The experiments of the two former gentlemen prepared the way for the conclufion that was afterwards drawn from them by the latter, though they retained the common opinion of electric atmofpheres, and endeavoured to explain the phenomena by it. The conclufion was, that the electric fluid, when there is a redundancy of it in any body, re¬ pels the electric fluid in any other body, when they are brought within the fphere of each others influence, and drives it into the remote parts of the body, or quite out of it, if there be any outlet for that purpofe","Franklin, Canton",US,5,United States,North America

Mr Baldwin felt no o- ther effett than a general weaknefs in his joints and limbs, and a kind of liftlefs feeling ; all which, he ob- ferves, might poflibly be the effeft of furprife, though it was fufficient todifcourage him from perfifting in any farther attempt at that time. He therefore drew in his kite, and retired to a fhop till the ftorm was over, and then went to his houfe, where he found his friends much more furprifed than he had been himfelf j and who, after exprefling their aftoniftiment, informed him, that he ap¬ peared to them (during the time he was raifing the kite, to be in the midft of a large bright flame of fire, R I C I T Y.

"M. SaulTure has given an inftance of this periodic flux in eleClricity, on the 22d of February, 1785, (one of the coldeft days ever remembered at Geneva) } the hy¬ grometer and thermometer were fufpended in the open air, on a terrace expofed to the fouth-weft } the electro¬ meter, from its fituation, indicated an eleClricity equal to what it would have fhewn if it had been placed on an open plain* The height of the barometer is reduced to what it would have been if the mercury had been conftant’y at the temperature of 10 degrees of Reau¬ mur’s thermometer. The place of obfervation was ele¬ vated 60 feet above the level of the lake. The ob¬ fervations of the day preceding and following this great cold, are inferted in the following table } becaufe it is pleafing to have the obfervations which precede and fol¬ low any Angular phenomena.

"In the Shetland ides, the merry dancers, as the nor¬ thern lights are there called, are the conftant atten¬ dants of clear evenings, and afford great relief amid the gloom of the long winter nights. They commonly appear at twilight, near the horizon, of a dim colour, approaching to yellow ; fometimes continuing in that Hate for feveral hours, without any perceptible motion; and afterwards breaking out into ftreams of ftronger light, fpreading into columns, and changing (lowly in¬ to numberlefs different fhapes, and varying in colour from all the tints of yellow, to the moft obfeure ruffet brown. They often cover the whole hemifphere; then exhibiting the mod; brilliant appearance. Their motions at this lime are exceedingly quick, and they aftonifli the fpeclator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were feen before, Ikim briikly along the heavens, are fuddenly extinguiflied, and are fucceeded by a uniform dulky trad!. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the fame manner, and as fuddenly becomes a dark fpace. In fome nights, they affume the appearance of large columns, on one fide of the deepeft yellow, and on the other gradually changing, till it becomes undiflinguifhable from the Iky. They have generally a firong tremulous motion from one end to the other, continuing till the whole vanilhes. As for us, who fee only the extremities of thefe phenomena, we can have but a faint idea of their fplendour and motions. They differ in colour accord¬ ing to the (late of the atmofphere, and fometimes af¬ firming the colour of blood, they make a dreadful ap¬ pearance. The ruftie fages who obferve them become prophetic, and terrify the fpedlators with alarm of war, peftilence, and famine j nor indeed were thefe fuperfii- tious pn fages peculiar to the northern iflands: appear¬ ances of a fimilar nature are of an ancient date •, and they were difHuguiflred by the appellations of phafmata, trabes, and bolides, according to their forms and co¬ lours. In old times they were either more rare or lefs frequently noticed $ but when they occured, they were Part V, fuppofed to portend great events, and the timid imagi- Atmo nation formed of them aerial conflidls. fpherical In the northern latitudes of Sweden and Lapland, Ele&ricit) the aurora borealis is not only an objeft of pleafing cu- v ■ riofity from the fingular beauty of its appearance, but is extremely ufeful in affording to travellers, by its al- mofl: conftant effulgence, a very brilliant light. In Hudfon’s bay, it is faid to poffefsa variegated fplendour, equalling that of the full moon. “ In the north-eaft- ern parts of Siberia,” fays Gmelin, “ (befe northern lights are obferved to begin with fingle bright pillars rifing in the north, and almoft at the fame time in the north-eaft, which gradually increafing, comprehend a large fpace of the heavens, rufh about from place to place with incredible velocity, and finally almoft cover the whole Iky up to the zenith, and produce an appear¬ ance as if a vaft tent was fpread in the heavens, glitter¬ ing with gold, rubies, and fapphire. A more beautiful fpeftacle cannot be painted ; but whoever (hould fee fueh a northern light for the firft time, could not behold it without terror. For however fine the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned, with fuch a bif¬ fing, cracking, and rufhing noife through the air, as if the largeft fireworks were playing off. To deferibe what they then hear, they make ufe of the expreflion fpolochi chodjat, i. e. “ the raging holt is pafling.” The hunters who purfue the white and blue foxes on the con¬ fines of the Icy fea, are often overtaken with thefe northern lights. Their dogs are then fo frightened, that they will not move, but lie obftinately on the ground till the noife has paffed. Commonly clear and calm weather follows this kind of northern lights. I have heard this account, not from one perfon only, but confirmed by the teftimony of many who have (pent part of feveral years in thefe very northern regions, and inhabited different countries from the Yenifex to the*^1^ Lena ; fo that no doubt of its truth can remain.
