"Annuities for lives have occafionally been granted in two different ways; either upon feparate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French are called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are granted upon feparate lives, the death of every indivi¬ dual annuitant dilburthens the public revenue fo far as it was affected by his annuity. When annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public re¬ venue docs not commence till the death of all the an¬ nuitants comprehended in one lot, which may fometimes ednfift of twenty or thirty perfons, of whom the fur- vivors fucceed to the annuities of all thofe who die be¬ fore them ; the laft furvivor fucceeding to the annui¬ ties of the whole lot. Upon the fame revenue more money can always be raifed by tontines than by an¬ nuities for feparate lives. An annuity, with a right of furvivorfhip, is really worth more than an equal an¬ nuity for a feparate life, and from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the fuccefs of all lot¬ teries, fuch an annuity generally fells for fomething more than it is worth. In countries where it is ufual for government to raife money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this account generally preferred to annuities for feparate lives. The expedient which will raife mofl money, is almoft always preferred to that which is likely to bring about in the fpeedieft manner the liberation of the public revenue",,FR,3,France,Europe

The annuities themfelves-are computed to a- mount to thirty millions a-year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the fuppofed intereft of that whole debt. It is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of France and England for the liberation of the public revenue, which ocea- fions this difference in their refpejftive modes of bor¬ rowing ; it arifes altogether from the dift'erent views and interefts of the lenders",,FR,3,France,Europe

D. 140, only 20 years after that of Adrian, of which this feems to have been an imitation. This wall or rampart, as feme imagine, reached from Caer-ridden on the frith of Forth to Old Kirkpatrick on the Clyde ; or, as o- thers think, from Kinniel on the eaft to Dunglafs on the weft. Thefe difterent fuppofitions hardly make a mile of difference in the length of this work, which, from feveral adhial menfurations, appears to have been 37 Englifli or 40 Roman miles. Capitolinus, in his life of Antoninus Pius, diredlly affirms, that the wall which that emperor built in Britain was of turf. This in the main is unqueftionably true ; though it is evident (from the veftiges of it ftill remaining, which not very many years ago were dug up and examined for near a mile together) that the foundation was of ftone.

"Aqusedudts of every kind were long ago the wonders of Rome ; the vaft quantity of them which they had ; the prodigious expence employed in conducing Waters over arcades from one place to another, at the diftance of 30, 40, 60, and even 100 miles, which were either continued or fupplied by other labours, as by cutting mountains and piercing rocks; all this ought to fur- prife us ; nothing like this is undertaken in our times: we dare not even think of purchafing public conveni- ency at fo dear a rate. Appias the cenfor advifed and conftrudted the firft aquasduift. His example gave the public luxury a hint to cultivate thefe obje&s ; and the force of prodigious and indefatigable labour diverted the courfe of rivers and floods to Rome. Agrippa, in that year when he was aedtle, put the laft hand to the magnificence of thefe works. It is chiefly in this re- fpedt that the modern fo much refembles the ancient city of Rome. For this advantage, ftie is peculiarly indebted to Sextus V. and to Paul V. who for gran¬ deur and magnificence emulated the mafters of the uni- verfe *. There are ftill to be feen, in different places* See Net*- contiguous to Rome, ftriking remains of thefe aquse- Memoirs dudts; arches continued thro’ a long fpace, over which °f were extended the canals which carried the water tovol*_u the city. The arches are fometimes low, fometimes raifed t® a vaft height, to humour the tumidities or de* preffions of the ground. There are fome which have two arcades, one conftrudted above the other; and this precaution was obferved, left the height of a Angle ar¬ cade, if extended as far as the fituation required, might render the ftrudture lefs firm and permanent. They are commonly of bricks ; which by their cement cohere fo ftrongly, that the parts are not feparated without the utmoft difficulty..—When the elevations of the ground, were enormous, it became neceffary to form fubterrane~ aquffidutfts. Thefe carried the waters to fuch aquse¬ dufts as were raifed above ground, in the declivity or at the foot of mountains.

"There is one thing, however, which deferves to be remarked. It is, that thefe aqusedufts, which might have been direfted in a ftraight line to the city, did not arrive at it but by frequent and winding mazes.

It is replied, the motive of obtaining the water more falubrious, and more limpid, was fufficient to make the Romans think their labour neceffary, and their expence properly beftowed; and to thofe who re- fleed that the waters of this river were impregnated with mineral particles, and by no means wholefome, the an- fwer will appear fatisfadtory","Tivoli, Rome","IT,US",3,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

This advice was followed by AbtxObeidahj who caufed the citadel to noeuvre he likewife hoped that Ycukinna would be L upon his guard. Herein, however, he found him¬ felf miftaken: for the Greek commander, by the pru¬ dent meafures he took, eluded all furprize ; and tho’ Abu Obeidah continued the fiege for four months al¬ ter the laft-mentioned blow given to the garrifon by Khaled, yet he had fcarce any hopes of making himfelf mafter of it at laft. Having nothing material to write to the khalif, he remained a long time filent; at which Omar being very much concerned, wrote to him, dell¬ ring an account of the affairs in Syria. Abu Obeidah acquainted him that the city of Aleppo had fubmitted to him ; and that the citadel was the only place which held out in all that country, before which he had loft a great number of men, which, he faid, had induced him to think of railing the fiege, and moving with his ar¬ my m that track which lay between Antioch and A- leppo. This news was by no means, agreeable to the khalif, who commanded his general to continue the fiege at all events, and fent him a reinforcement of Arab troops, together with 70 camels, to aflift the infantry in their march. g$ Among the troops fent by Omar on this occafion,Thecnade! there was an Arab of a gigantic fize, called ZWicj. taken bx whoftrata£em* A R A [ 165 ] A R A Arabia, who •was a man of great courage and refolution.

He therefore deiired that Abu Obeidah would affign him the command of a party con- fifling only of thirty men; which at Khaled’s requeft was readily granted. Then he begged the general to raife the fiege, and retire to about three miles difiance from the cafile, which was like wife immediately com¬ plied with. The following night Dames, who had ported himfelf with his party very near the citadel, found means to feize a Greek, from whom he learned Ithat Youkinna, after the fiege was raifed, had exadted large fums of money from the citizens, on account of the treaty they had concluded with the Arabs and that he was one of thofe who had endeavoured to make their efcape from the opprefiion of fuch a tyrant, by leaping down from the wall. This man Dames took under his protection; but beheaded five or fix others who fell into his hands, and could give no good account of ' % , themfelves. He then covered his head and fhoulders with a goat’s fiun, and took a dry cruft in his hand, creeping on the ground till he got clofe to the foot of the wall. If he heard any noife, or fufpedted any perfon to be near, he made fuch a noife with his cruft as a dog does when he is gnawing a bone ; his compa¬ nions fometimes walking, and fometimes creeping after him in the fame manner. He had before difpatched two of his men to Abu Obeidah, to defire that a de¬ tachment of horfe might be fent him by break of day to fupport his fmall party, and facilitate the execution of the plan he had formed. At laft Dames found an opportunity of raifing fcven men upon his fhoul¬ ders, who flood one upon another’s fhoulders in fuch a manner that the higheft reached the top of the wall.

"The dialed of the Koreifh, termed by the Koran the perfpicuous and clear Arabic, is referred to Ifhmael as its author; who, fay the above mentioned writers, firft fpoke it; and, as Dr Pocock believes, after he had con- traded an alliance with the family of Jorham by mar¬ riage, formed it of their language and the original He¬ brew.

That having had an opportunity of examining the effefts of this animal in die province of Taranto, where it is found in great abundance, he finds that the furprifing cure of the bite of the tarantula by mufic has not the lead truth in it; and that it is only an invention of the people, who \vant to get a little money by dancing when they fay the tarantifm begins. He adds, “ I make no doubt but fometimes the heat of the climate contributes very much to warm their imaginations, and throw them into a delirium, which may be in feme mea- fure cured by mufic; but feveral experiments have been tried with the tarantula, and neither men nor animals after the bite have had any other complaint than a very trifling inflammation upon the part, like that produ¬ ced by the bite of a fcorpion, which goes off by it- felf without any danger at all. In Sicily, where the fummer is ftill warmer than in any part of the king¬ dom of Naples,' the tarantula is never dangerous; and mufic is never employed for the cure of the pretended tarantifm.” Mr Swinburn, when in the country of the tarantula, was defirous of inveftigating minutely every particu¬ lar relative to that infedt; but the feafon was not far -enough advanced, and no tarantati (perfons bitten, or pretending to be bitten, by the tarantula) had begun to ftir.

"The length of the dance, and the patient’s powers of bearing fuch exceffive fatigue in the canicular feafon, prove nothing ; becaufe every day, at that time of the year, peafants may be feen dancing with equal fpirit and perfeverance, though they do not pretend to be feized with the tarantifm. The illnefs may therefore be attributed to hyilerics, exceffive heat, ftoppage of perfpiration, and other effedts of fleeping out of doors in a hot fummer air, which is always extremely dan¬ gerous, if not mortal, in mofl; parts of Italy. Violent exercife may have been found to be a certain cure for this diforder, and continued by tradition, though the date and circumftances of this difeovery have been long buried in oblivion ; a natural paffion for dancing, imi¬ tation, cuftom of the country, and a.defire of raifing contributions upon the fpectators, are probably the real motives that infpire the tarantati.

"Ancient We have already taken notice, that among the an- architec- cient Egyptians, Perfians, and Babylonians, the vaft ture fupe- ftrength and extent of their buildings feems to have deurto^h""^cen w^at they chiefly valued ; and in this they cer- modern. ^ ta^n^7 as muck excelled the Greeks and modern nations as the latter excel them in the beautiful proportion and elegance of their ftrudttires. There are not want¬ ing, however, fome modern authors, who endeavour to deprive the ancients of what is juftly their due, and will have every thing to be exaggerated which feems be¬ yond the power of modem princes to accompliflx. In this way M. Goguet remarkably diftinguifhes himfelf; and that without giving any reafon at all, but merely that he takes it into his head. Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effect, that the walls of Babylon could have been sr8 feet high and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhow us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it muft contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms ; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiftorians, this .immenfe mafs of building was finilhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchadnezzar, or whoever ■fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for 10 years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as ftrongly as it is faid to have been ; for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly .fo, amounting to 18,189,’600 folid fathoms. When onr author afterwards gafeonades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power-, tale, and time, to finilh Verfailles, •with all its defedls, than to conftnnft a pyramid, or e- red an obeliflt.” The genius, tafte, and time, we .fliall not difpute ; but as the fame author confeffes that J 00)000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftrudion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time -the ahovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fomc of the works of which M. Goguet •boafts fo much.

But though the art of architecture continued almoft at its higheft pitch among the Ro¬ mans for two centuries, it declined exceedingly as the empire began to fail. Tacitus relates, that after the battle of ACthim no men of genius appeared; and af¬ ter the reign of Alexander Severus, a manner of build¬ ing altogether confufed and irregular was introduced, wherein nothing of the true graces and majefty of the E C T U R E. 221 former was preferved.

"Mofi writers who mention the ancient buildings in this ifland, particularly -the religious ones, notwith- ftanding the ftriking difference in the ftyles of their conftruCtion, clafs them all under the common deno¬ mination of Gothic} a general appellation by them ap¬ plied to buildings not exactly conformable to feme one of the five orders of architecture. Our modern anti¬ quaries, more accurately, divide them into Saxon,— Norman,—and Saracenic, or that fpecies vulgarly tho’ improperly called modern Gothic. 23 It has been maintained by fome, that the Saxon Of theSax- churches, after they began to be built with ftone, con- onandNm- fifted only of upright walls, without pillars or arches,maa the conftruCtion of which it is alledged they were en¬ tirely ignorant of.

Indeed, it is highly improbable that the Saxons could be ignorant of fo ufeful a contrivance as the arch. Many of them, built by the Romans, they muft have had before their eyes ; fome of which have reached our days: two particularly are now remaining in Canterbury only ; one in the caftle-yard, the other at Riding-gate.

Befides, as it ap¬ pears from undoubted authorities they procured work¬ men from the Continent to conftruCt their capital build¬ ings “ according to the Roman manner,” this alone would be fufficient to confute that ill-grounded opinion; and at the fame time proves, that wffiat we commonly call Saxon, is in reality Roman architecture","Norman, Canterbury, Roman, Roman","RO,US,GB",3,"Romania,United States,United Kingdom","Europe,North America,Europe"
"This was the ftyle of building praCtifed all over Eu¬ rope ; and it continued to be ufed by the Normans, after their arrival here, till the introduction of wffiat is called the modern Gothic, which was not till about the end of the reign of Henry II. fo that there feems to be little or no grounds for a diftinCtion between the Saxon and Norman architecture. Indeed it is faid, the buildings of the latter were of larger dimenfions both in height and area; and they were conftruCted with a ftone brought from Caen in Normandy, of which their workmen were peculiarly fond: but this was Amply an alteration in the fcale and materials, and not in the manner of the building. The ancient parts of moft of our cathedrals are of this'early Norman work.—The charaCteriftic marks of this ftyle are thefe : The wndls are very thick, generally without buttreffes; the arches, both within and without, as well as thofe over the doors and windows, femicircular, and fupported by very 222 A R C H I T very folld, or rather clumfy, columns, with a kind of regular bafe and capital: in iliort, plainnefs and foil* dit'y coniiitute the itriking features of this method of building.

From all the marks of the new architecture, it can only be attributed to the Moors; or, what is the fame thing, to the Arabians or Saracens, who have exprefled, in their architecture, the fame tafte as in their poetry; both the one and the other falfely delicate, crowded withfuperfluous ornaments, and often very unnatural: the imagination's highly worked up in both ; but it is an extravagant imagination ; and this has rendered the",Roman,RO,3,Romania,Europe
"edifices of the Arabians (we may include the other o- rientals) as extraordinary as their thoughts. If any one doubts of this affertion, let us appeal to’ any one who has feen the.mofques and palaces of Fez, or .fome of the cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors : one model of this fort is the church at Burgos; and even in this ifland there are not wanting feveral examples of the fame ; fuch buildings have been vulgarly called modern Gothic, but their true appellation is Arabic, Saracenic, or Morefque.*--This manner was introduced E c T tl R E. Hiftorjf into Europe thro’ Spain. Learning ffouriftied: among the Arabians all the time that their dominion was in full power; they ftudied philofophy, mathematics, phyfic and poetry. The love of learning was at once excited; in all places that wer^, not at too great a diftance from Spain, thefe authors were read; and fuch of the Greek authors as they had tranflated into | Arabic, were from thence turned into Latin. The phyfic and philofophy of the Arabians fpread themfelves in Europe, and with thefe their architeClure: many churches were built after the Saracenic mode ; and o- thers with a mixture of heavy and light proportions, the alteration that the difference of the climate might require, was little, if at all confidered. In moft fou- thern parts of Europe, and in Africa, the windows (before the ufe of glafs), made with narrow apertures, and placed very high in the walls of the building, occa- fioned a fliade and darknefs within fide, and were all i contrived to guard againft the fierce rays of the fun ; yet were ill fuited to latitudes, where that glorious lu* minary fliades its feebler influences, and is rarely feen but through a watery cloud.” Mr Grofe, however, thinks the above opinion is notfuf- ficiently favoured by the obfervations of feveral learned travellers -who have accurately furveyed the ancient mode of building in thofe parts of the world. Thus Cornelius le Brun, an indefatigable and inquifitive tra¬ veller, has publifhed many views of eaftern buildings, particularly about the Holy Land: in all thefe, only one Gothic ruin, the church near Acre, and a few pointed arches occur; and thofe built by the Chri- ftians when in poffeffion of the country. Near Ifpa- han, in Perfia, he gives feveral buildings wuth pointed arches : but thefe are bridges and caravanferas, whofe age cannot be afcertained ; confequently are as likely to have been built after,as before the introduction of this ftyle into Europe. At Ifpahan itfelf, the mey doen, or grand, market-place, is furrounded by divers magnificent Gothic buildings ; particularly the royal ■ mofque, and the Talael Ali-kapie, or theatre.

"(lory.

This mofque was, as it is there faid, begun by Abdoulrah- man I. who laid the foundation two years before his death, and was finifhed by his fan HilTem, or Ifcan, about the year 800. If thefe arches were part of the original ftrudlure, it would be much in favour of the fuppofition; but as it is alfo faid that edifice has been more than once altered and enlarged by the Mahome¬ tans, before any wrell-grounded conclufion can be drawn, it is neceflary to afcertain the date of the prefent build¬ ing",London,"ES,FR,GB",3,"Spain,France,United Kingdom","Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Bifhop Warburton, in his notes on Pope’s Epiftles, in the odtavo edition, has the following ingenious ob- fervationson this fiubjedt:—“ Our Gothic anceftorshad jufter and manlier notions of magnificence, on Greek and Roman ideas, than thefe mimics of tafte, who profefs to ftudy only claffic elegance ; and becaufe the thing does honour to the genius of thofe barbarians, I fhall endeavour to explain it.

"This, by way of diftinction, I would call the Saxon architeaure. But our Norman works had a very dif¬ ferent original. When^ the Goths had conquered Spain, and the genial warmth of the climate and the religion of the old inhabitants had ripened their wits and inflamed their miftaken piety, both kept in exer- - cife by the neighbourhood of the Saracens, through e- mulation of their fervice, and averfion to their fuper- ftition, they ftruck out a new ipecies of architeaure, unknown to Greece and Rome, upon original princi¬ ples, and ideas much nobler than what had given birth even to claflical magnificence. For this northern peo¬ ple having been accuftomed, during the gloom of pa- ganifm, to worfhip the deity in groves (a praaioe common to all nations); when their new religion re¬ quired covered edifices, they ingenioufly projeaed to make them refemble groves, as nearly as the diftance of architeaure would permit; at once indulging their old prejudices, and providing for their prefent conve¬ niences","Norman, Rome","US,ES,GR",3,"United States,Spain,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe"
"This too will account for the contrary qualities in what I call the Saxon arehite<fture. Theie artifts copied, as has been faid, from the churches in the Holy Land, which were built on the models of the Grecian archi- teclure, but corrupted by prevailing barbarifm; and ftill farther depraved by a religious idea. The firft places of Chriftian worftiip were fepulchres and fub- terraneous caverns, low and heavy from neceffity. When Chriftianity became the religion of the ftate, and fump- tuous temples began to be eredted, they yet, in regard to the firft pious ages, preferved the maffive ftyle, made ftill more venerable by the church of the Holy Se¬ pulchre ; where this ftyle was, on a double account, followed and aggravated.” Rife and In Britain, before the Roman invafion, the natives progrefs of appear to have had no better lodgings than thickets, architec- dens, and caves. Some of thefe caves, which were ture inBri- t}lejr winter-habitations, and places of retreat in time tam. 0f -war, were formed and rendered fecure and warm by art, like thofe of the ancient Germans, which are thus defcyibed by Tacitus : “ They are ufed to dig deep caves in the ground and cover them with earth, where they lay up their provifions, and dwell in winter for the fake of warmth. Into thofe they retire alfo from their N° 26",Roman,RO,3,Romania,Europe
"Though the communication between this ifland and the Continent was more free and open after the firft Roman invafion than it had been before, and fome of the Britifli princes and chieftains even vifited Rome, then in its greateft glory ; it doth not appear that the % people of Britain made any confiderable improvements in their manner of building for at lead a hundred years after that invafion. For when the renowned Chararia- cus was carried prifoner to Rome, A. D. 52, and ob- ferved the beauty and magnificence of the buildings in that proud metropolis of the world, he is faid to have expreffed great furprife, “ That the Romans, who had fuch magnificent palaces of their own, fhould envy the wretched cabbins of the Britons.” It muft appear very furprifing that the ancient Bri¬ tons, when they were fo ignorant of architecture, were capable of erecting (if indeed it was eredted by them) fo ftupendous a fabric as that of Stonehenge on Salif- bury plain : A fabric which hath been the admiration of all fucceeding ages, and hath outlafted all the folid and noble ftrudtures which were eredted by the Romans in this ifland.

"But for whatever purpofes, or by whatever means, the above and other fimilar ftruCtures of a peculiar na¬ ture were ereCted, we have fufficient evidence that the people of Britain, before they were fubdued and in- ftrufted by the Romans, had but a rude knowledge of architecture, and were very meanly lodged. As foon, however, as the Romans began to form fettlements and plant colonies in this ifland, a fudden and furprifing change enfued in the ftate of architecture. For that wonderful people were as induftrious as they were brave, and made hafte to adorn every country that they conquered. The firft Roman colony was planted at Camelodunum, A. D. 50; and when it was deftroyed by the Britons in their great revolt under Boadicia, only eleven years after, it appears to have been a large and well built town, adorned wkhftatues, temples, the¬ atres, and other public edifices",Roman,RO,3,Romania,Europe
"This was one of the arts which Agricola, the moft ex¬ cellent of the Roman governors, employed to civilize the Britons, and reconcile them to the Roman govern¬ ment. “ The following winter (fays Tacitus) was fpent by Agricola in very falutary meafures. That the Britons who led a roaming and unfettled life, and were eafily inftigated to war, might contract a love to peace and tranquillity, by being accuftomed to a more pleafant way of living, he exhorted and aflifted them to build houfes, temples, courts, and market¬ places. By praifmg the diligent and reproaching the indolent, he excited fo great an emulation among the Britons, that after they had ereCted all thofe neceffary edifices in their towns, they proceeded to build others merely for ornament and pleafure, as porticoes, galle¬ ries, baths, banqueting-houfes, &c.” From this time, which was A. D. 80, to the middle of the fourth cen¬ tury, architecture and all the arts immediately connect¬ ed with it greatly flourilhed in this ifland; and the fame tafte for ereCting folid, convenient, and beautiful buildings, which had long prevailed in Italy, was in¬ troduced into Britain. Every Roman colony and free city (of which there was a great number in this coun¬ try) was a little Rome, encompaffed with ftrong walls, adorned with temples, palaces, courts, halls, bafililks, baths, markets, aqueduCts, and many other fine build¬ ings, both for ufe and ornament. The country every where abounded with well-built villages, towns, forts, and ftations ; and the whole was defended by that high and ftrong wall, with its many towers and caftles, which reached from the mouth of the river Tine on the eaft to the Solway Firth on the weft. This fpirit of building,, which was introduced and encouraged by the Romans, fo much improved the tafte and increafed the number of the Britifli builders, that in the third ■ century this ifland was famous for the great number ' and excellence of. its architects and artificers.

"The truth is, that the Anglo-Saxons at their arrival in this illand were almoft totally ignorant of thefe arts ; fand, like all the other nations of Germany, had been accuftomed to live in wretched hovels, built of wood ,or earth, and covered with ftraw or the branches of trees : nor did they much improve in the knowledge ?of architedlure for 200 years after their arrival. Du¬ ring that period, mafonry was quite unknown and un- praftifed in this ifland ; and the walls even of cathe¬ dral churches were built of wood. “ There was a time (fays Venerable Bede) when there was ,not a ftone church in all the land ; but the cuftom was to build ..them all of wood. Finan, the fecond bifhop of Lin- disfarne, or Holy Illand, built a church in that ifland, A. D. 65.2, for a- cathedral, which yet was not of ftone, but of wood, and covered with reeds; and fo it continued till Eadhert, the fucceflbr of St Cuthbert, and feventh bifliop of Lindisfarne, took away the reeds, and covered it all over, both roofand walls, with Iheets of lead.” The firft cathedral of York was built of the Fame materials ; and a church of ftone was efteemed a kind of prodigy in thofe times that merited a place in hiftory. “ Paulinus, the firft biftiop of York, built a .church of ftone in the city of Lincoln, whofe walls (fays Bede) are ftill Handing, though the roof is fallen down; and fome healing miracles are wrought in it ; every year, for the benefit of thofe who have the faith to feek them.-” There does not feem to have been fo much as one church of ftone, nor any artifts who could build one, in all Scotland, at the beginning of the eighth centu¬ ry.

Hiji were built in all parts, together with the many mag* ^ccJaa nificent cloifters and monafteries, and other apartments ' ' of monks, that were then ereCted, afford a fufficient proof of .the great felicity of England in the reign of Henry 1. The religious of every order, enjoying peace and profperity, difplayed the moft aftonilhing ardour in every thing that might increafe the fplendor of divine worftiip. The fervent zeal of die faithful prompted them to pull down houfes and churches every where, and rebuild them in a better manner. By this •means the ancient edifices that had been raifed in the -d ays of Edgar, Edward, and other Chriflian kings, were demolimed, and others .of greater magnitude and magnificence, and of more elegant workmanftiip, were erected in their room, to the glory of God.” As the prodigious power of religious zeal, what¬ ever turn it happens to take, when it is thoroughly heated, Is well known, it may not be improper to give -one example of the arts employed by the clergy and monks of this period, to inflame the pious ardour of the kings, nobles, and people, for building and adorn¬ ing churches. When Joffred Abbot of Croyland re- iblved to rebuild the church of his monaftery in a moft magnificent manner, A. D. nc6, he obtained from the Archbiftiops of Canterbury and York, a bull dif- •penfing with the third part of all penances for fin to thofe who contributed any thing towards the building ,©f that church. This bull was directed not only to the king and people of England, but to the kings of France and Scotland, and to all other kings, earls, ba¬ tons, archbilhops, bilhops, abbots, priors, redtors, pre¬ sbyters, and clerks, and to all true .believers in Chrift, E c T U R E.

To make the beft ufe of this bull, he fent two of his moft eloquent monks to proclaim it over all France and Flanders, two other monks into Scotland, two into Denmark and Nor¬ way, two into Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and others into different parts of England. “ By this means (fays the hiftorian) the wonderful benefits granted to all the contributors to the building of this church were pub- lilhed to the very ends of the earth; and great heaps of treafure and maffes of yellow metal flowed in from all countries upon the venerable Abbot Joffred, and encouraged him to lay tire foundations of his church.” Having fpent about four years in colleding mountains of different kinds of marble from quarries both at home and abroad, together with great quantities of lime, iron, brafs, and other materials for building, he fixed a day for the great ceremony of laying the foun¬ dation, which he contrived to make a very effectual mean of raifing the fuperftru&ure : For on the long- expe&ed day, the feaft of the Holy Virgins Felicitas and Perpetua, an immenfe multitude of earls, barons, and knights, with their ladies and families, of abbots, priors, monks, nuns, clerks, and perfons of all ranks, arrived at Croyland, to aflift at this ceremony. The pious Abbot Joffred began by faying certain prayers, and fhedding a flood of tears on the foundation. Then each of the earls, barons, knights, with their ladies, fons, and daughters, the abbots, clerks, and others, laid a ftone, and upon it depofited a fum of money, a rant of lands, tithes, or patronages, or a promife of one, lime, wood, labour, or carriages, for building the church. After this the Abbot entertained the v/hole company, amounting to jooo perfons, at din¬ ner. To this entertainment they were all intitled; for the money, and grants of different kinds, which they had depofited on the foundation-ftones, were alone fuf¬ ficient to have raifed a very noble fabric.

By degrees, through much practice, our architects, who were all monks or clergymen, improved in their tafte and fkill, and ventured to form plans of more noble, light, .and elevated ftruCtures, with a great variety of orna¬ ments.; which led to that bold magnificent ftyle of build¬ ing, commonly, though perhaps not very properly, called the later Gothic.

But the palaces, or rather caftles, of the Anglo-Norman tings, barons, and prelates, were very different from E C T U R E. 229 the refidences of perfims of the fame rank in the Anglo- Saxon times. For this we have the teftimony of a perfon of undoubted credit, who was well acquainted with them both. “ The Anglo-Saxon nobles (fays William of Malmfbury) fquandered away their ample revenues in low and mean houfes; but the French and Norman barons are very different from them, living at lefs expence, but in great and magnificent palaces.’’ The truth is, that the rage of building fortified caftles, was no lefs violent among the Norman princes, prelates, and barons, than that of building churches. To this they were prompted not only by the cullom of their native country, but alfo by their dangerous fituation in this ifland.

William of Sens, architeft to Archbilhop Lanfranc in building his cathe¬ dral, is faid, by Gervafe of Canterbury, to have been a moil exquifite artill both in ftone and wood. He made not only a model of the whole cathedral, but of every particularpiece of fculpture and carving, for the direction of the workmen, and invented many curious machines for loading and unloading fhips, and conveying heavy weights by land, becaufe all the ftones were brought from Normandy. Matthew Paris fpeaks even in a higher drain of Walter of Coventry, who flourilhed to¬ wards the end of this period, when he fays, that “ fo excellent an archited had never yet appeared, and pro¬ bably never would appear, in the world.” This enco¬ mium was undoubtedly too high ; but it is impoffible to view the remains of many magnificent fabrics, both facred and civil, that were ereded in this period, with¬ out admiring the genius of the architeds by whom they were planned, and the dexterity of the workmen by whom they were executed","Sens, Canterbury, Coventry","FR,GB,US",3,"France,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

"However, moft of the great buildings of Queen Eliza¬ beth’s reign have a ftyle peculiar to themfelves both in form and finiftiing; where, though much of the old Gothic is retained, and great part of the new tafte is adopted, yet neither predominates ; while both, thus diftindtly blended, compofe a fantaftic fpecies, hardly reducible to any clafs or name. One of its chara<Ster- iftics is the affedlation of large and lofty windows : where, fays Bacon, “ you {hall have fometimes fair houfes fo full of glafs, that one cannot tell where to come to be out of the fun.” To return now to our general hiftory, and to con¬ clude : In the ijth and 16th centuries, when learning of all kinds began to revive, the chafte architecture of the Greeks and Rogsnans feemed as it were to be re¬ called into life. The firft improvements in it began in Italy, and owed their exiftence to the many ruins of the ancient Roman ftrudtures that were to be found* in that country, from whence an improved method of building was gradually brought into the other countries of Europe : and though the Italians for a long time retained the fuperiority as architects over the other European nations; yet, as men of genius travelled from all quarters into Italy, where they had an oppor¬ tunity of feeing the originals from whence the Italians copied, architects have arifen in other nations equal, if not fuperior, to any that ever appeared in Italy.

"Nothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-houfe Ought to be fuited to the climate; yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houfes, not forgetting even thofe parts that are purpofely contrived for collecting air, and for excluding the fun: witnefs our colonnades and logics, defigned by the Italians to gather cool air, and exclude the beams of the fun, conveniences which the climate of this country does not require. 27 We Avail next view architecture as one of the fineArchitec- arts; which will lead us to the examination of fuchtuie confi- buildings, and parts of buildings, as are calculated fole-^ered as a ly to pleafe the eye. Variety prevails in the works of“ne art* nature ; but art requires to be guided by rule and com- pafs.

But in works of art that are original and not imitative, fuch as architecture, ftriCt regularity and u- niformity ought to be ftudied, lb far as confiftent with utility. . 28 Proportion is not lefs agreeable than regularity andDifference uniformity; and therefore, in buildings intended tobetween pleafe the eye, they are all equally eflential.

The pope would have detained him at Rome ; but labouring under a bodily difor- der, and fearing an injury to his health from the air of the place, and the heats of the fummer, which was then approaching, Guido left that city upon a promife to revifit it, and explain to his holinefi the principles of his new fyftem.

"The occafion of this expedition is thus reprelented by Greek writers. Phryxus, flying with his fifttr Helle from the rage of their flep-mother Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, went on board a fliip, whole en- fign was a golden ram, and failed to Colchis (now, Mingrelia, part of Georgia). Helle was drowned by the way, in that fea which from her was called the Hellefpont, now the Dardanelles. This, according to fome, was the ground of the poetical fable, that a ram with a golden fleece fwam away with them to Colchis j and that the Argonauts undertook their famed expe¬ dition, in order to find that fleece. But Strabo and Arrian informs us, that it was a practice of the Col- chians to colledf gold on mount Caucafus by ex¬ tending fleeces acrofs the beds of the torrents 5 and as the water pafled, the metallic particles remain¬ ed entangled in the wool : hence"", according to thofe hiftorians, the adventure was named the expedition of the golden fleece. Sir Ifaac Newton thinks that this expedition was really an embaffy fent by the Greeks, during the inteftine divifions of Egypt in the reign of Amenophis, to perfuade the nations upon the coafts of the Euxine and Mediterranean feas, to take that op¬ portunity of fliaking off the yoke of Egypt, which Se- foftris had laid upon them ; and that fetching the gol¬ den fleece, was only , a pretence to cover their true defign","Ino, Newton","EG,GE,JP,US,GR",3,"Egypt,Georgia,Japan,United States,Greece","Africa,Asia,Asia,North America,Europe"
"But the mod judicious and fatisfa&ory account of the Argonautic expedition feems to be that given by Dr Gillies in his hiftory of Greece. “ The northern diftridfs of Theflaly being peculiarly expofed to the dangerous fury of invaders, the petty princes of that province entered into a confederacy for their mutual defence. They aflembled in fpring and autumn at Thermopylae, a place afterwards fb illuitrious, and then governed by Amphidyon, a defcendant of Deu¬ calion, whofe name is immortalized in the Amphidy- onic council. The advantages which the confederates derived from this.meafure, were foon perceived by their neighbours. The Central ftates gradually acced¬ ed to their alliance ; and about the middle of the four¬ teenth century before Chrift, Acrifius king of Argos, and other princes of the Teloponnefus, were allowed to (hare the benefits and fecurity of this ufeful aflbci- ation. See Amphictyons",,GR,3,Greece,Europe
"“ After this event, the Amphidyons appear to have long confined themfelves to the original purpofe of their inftitution. The ftates, whofe meafures wmre di- reded by this aflembly found fufficient occupation in defending their own territories j and near a century elapfed, before they undertook, by common confent> ] A R G any diftant expedition. But it was not to be expeded Argonauts! that their reftlefi adivity could be always exhauited in 1 v 1 defenfive war. The eftablifhment of the Amphidyons brought together the chiefs moft difling uilhed by birth and bravery. Glory and emulation prompted them to arms, and revenge direded thofe arms againft the bar¬ barians. Jafon, Admetus, and other chieftans of I hef- faly, having equipped a finali fleet in the neighbouring harbour o: loleu-, and particularly the flap Argo of fupenor fize and conftrudion to any before known,"" were animated with a defire to vifit foreign lands, to plant colonies in thole parts of them that. appeared moll delightful, and to retort on their inhabitants the injuries which Greece had luffered from ftrangers. 1 he princes of the north having proclaimed this fpirited defign over the central and fbuthern provinces, the ftandard of enterprize and glory was fpeedily furround- ed by the flower of the Grecian youth, who eagerly embraced this honourable opportunity to fignalize their manly valour.

"“ Thefe adventures, however, have been too much adorned by the graces of poetry, to be the proper fub- jedts of hiftorical compofition. The defigns of the Ar¬ gonauts are veiled under the allegorical, or at lead: doubtful, phrale, of carrying off the goldenfleece y which,, though ealily explained, if we admit the report that the inhabitants of the eaftern banks of the Euxine ex¬ tended fleeces of wool, in order to colled the golden particles which were carried down by the torrents from Mount Caucafus, is yet defcribed in fuch various lan¬ guage by ancient writers, that almoft every modern who examines the fubjed, thinks himfelf entitled to offer, by way of explanation, lome new conjedure of his own. But in oppofition to the moft approved of thefe conjedures, we may venture to affirm, that the voyage to Colchis was not undertaken with a view to eftablifh extenfive plans of commerce, or to learch for mines of gold, far lefs to learn the imaginary art of converting other fubftances into that precious metal j all fuch motives fuppofing a degree of /peculation and refinement unknown in that age to the gallant but un- inftrudfed youth of Tneflaly.

"ARIOSTO (Lodovico), the famous Italian poet, and author of Orlando Furiofo, was born at the caftle of Reggio in Lombardy in 1474. His father, who was major-domo to Duke Hercules, lived to the ex¬ tent of his fortune, fo left hut little at his death. A- riofto, from his childhood, (bowed great marks of ge¬ nius, efpecially in poetry; and wrote a comedy in verfe on the (lory of Pyramus and Thilbe, which his brothers and fillers played. His fathet being utterly unlearned, and rather regarding profit than his fon’s inclination, compelled him to ftudy the civil law, in which ha¬ ving plodded fome years to no purpole, he quitted it for more pleafing (Indies; yet often lamented, as Ovid A R I f 281 1 ART i^Anofia. ^ anj Petrarch did before him, and our own Milton I* See his ' ^ince *> t^at ^'s fat^er banifhed him from the mufes",Milton,"US,IT",3,"United States,Italy","North America,Europe"

However, in about fix years he wac, for his good parts, taken into the fervice of Don Hippolit'o, cardinal of Efte. At this time^he had written nothing but a few fonnets; but now he refolved to make a poem, and chole Bay- ardo’s Orlando Inamorato for a ground work. How- ever? he was prevented writing for a great many years, and was chofen as a fit perfon to go on an embaffy to Pope Julio II. where he gave fuch fatisfadion, that he was fent again, underwent many dangers and diffi¬ culties, and at his return was highly favoured. Then, at his leiiure, he again applied himfelf to his poem : I but, foon after, he incurred the cardinal’s difpleafure for refufing to accompany him into Hungary j by which he was fo difcouraged, that he deferred writing for 14 years, even till the cardinal’s ’death. After that, he finifhed by degrees,, in great perfe&ion, that which he began with great expeHation. Duke Aftolfo of¬ fered him great promotions if he would ferve him ; but preferring liberty to grandeur, he refufed this and other great offers from princes and cardinals, particu¬ larly from Leo X. from all whom he received not- withftanding great prefents. The Duke of Ferrara delighted fo much in his comedies, of which he wrote five, that he built a ftage on purpofe to hav them played in his court, and enabled our poet to build him¬ felf a houfe in Ferrara, with a plealant garden, where he ufed to compofe his poems, which were highly efteemed by all the princes in Italy, who fent him many prefents; but he faid, “ he would not fell his liberty for the beft cardinal’s hat in Rome.” It was but a fmall,. though convenient houfe : being alked, why he had not built it in a more magnificent man¬ ner, fince he had given fuch noble defcriptions of fump- tuous palaces, beautiful porticos, and pleafant foun¬ tains, in his Orlando Furiofo ? he replied.

Soon after, his brother began on the fame fub- Ar'P0’ jedt; but he eafily refuted him, and, with ftrong ar-""V— guments, juftified his own behaviour. “ Why then (faid hisbrother) didyou not fatisfymy father?-” “In truth (faid Ludovico) 1 was thinking of a part in my comedy ; and methought.my father’s fpeech to me w’as fo fuited to the part of an old man’s chiding his Ion, that I forgot I was concerned in it myfelf, and confi- dered it only to make it a part of my play.” It is alfo reported of Ariofto, that coining by a potter’s fhop, he heard him finging a ftave out of his Orlando, with fo bad a grace, that, out of all patience, he broke with his ftick feveral of his pots. The potter, in a pi¬ tiful tone, aiking what he meant by wronging a poor man that had never injured him ? “You rafcal (be replied), I have not done thee half the wrong thou haft done me : for I have broken but two or three pots' of thine, not worth lb many halfpence ; whereas thou haft broken and mangled a ftanza of mine worth a mark of gold.” Ariofto was tall, of a melancholy complexion, and fo abforbed in ftudy and meditation, that he often for¬ got himfelf. His pi&ure was drawn by Titian in a mafterly manner. He was honoured with the laurel by the hands of the emperor Charles V. He was na¬ turally affable, always affuming lefs than wus his due, yet never putting up a known injury even from his fu- periors.

Beauty was flu- Arts, died in objeCts of fight; and men of tafte attached w—y-—"" themfelves to the fine arts, which multiplied their en¬ joyments, and improved their benevolence. Sculpture and painting made an early figure in Greece 5 which afforded p’enty of beautiful originals to be copied in thefe imitative arts. Statuary, a more fimple imita¬ tion than painting, was fooner brought to perfection s the ftatue of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno by Po- lycletes, though the admiration of all the world, were executed long before the art of light and (hade was known. Apollodorus, and Zeuxis his difciple, wh® flourifhed in the 15th Olympiad, were the firft wh» figured in that art. Another caufe concurred to ad¬ vance ilatuary before painting in Greece, viz. a great demand for ftatues of their gods. Architecture, as a fine art, made a flower progrefs. Proportions, upon which its elegance chiefly depends, cannot be accu¬ rately afcertained, but by an infinity of trials in great buildings ; a model cannot be relied on : for a large and a fmall building, even of the fame form, require different proportions. 4 From the fine arts mentioned, we proceed tolitera- Literary ture. It is agreed, among all antiquaries, that the cdmpoft- firlt writings were in verfe, and that writing in profe t‘on' was of a much later date. The firil Greek who wrote in profe was Pherecides Syrus: the firft Roman was Appius Caecus, who compofed a declamation againlt Pyrrhus. The four books of the Chatah Bhade, which is the facred book of Hindoftan, are compofed in verle ftanzas ; and the Arabian compofitions in profe followed long after thofe in verfe. To account for that lingular faCt, many learned pens have been employed 5 but without fuccefs. By fome it has been urged, that as memory is the only record of events where writing is unknown, hiftory originally was compcled in verfe for the fake of memory. This is not fatisfactory. To undertake the painful talk of compofing in verfe, mere¬ ly for the fake of memory, would require more fore¬ fight than ever was exerted by a barbarian : not to mention that other means wereufed for preferving the memory of remarkable events; a heapof itones* a pillar, or other objeCt that catches the eye. The account given by Longinus is more ingenious. In a fragment of bis treatife on verfe, the only part that remains, he obferves, “ that meafure or verfe belongs to poetry, becaufe poetry reprefents the various paflions with their language ; for which reafon the ancients, in their ordinary difcourfe, delivered their thoughts in verfe rather than in profe.” Longinus thought, that an¬ ciently men were more expofed to accidents and dan¬ gers, than when they were protected by good govern¬ ment and by fortified cities. But he feems not to have adverted, that fear and grief, infpired by dangers and misfortunes, are better fuited to humble profe than to elevated verle. It may be added, that however na¬ tural poetical didtion may be when one is animated with any vivid paflion, it is not fuppofable that the ancients never wrote nor fpoke but when excited by paflion. Their hiftory, their laws, their covenants, were certainly not compofed in that tone of mind","Jupiter, Roman","GR,US,RO",3,"Greece,United States,Romania","Europe,North America,Europe"

"The Greek ftage has been juftly admired among all ^ , polite nations. The tragedies of Sophocles and Eu- TraSed?! ripides in particular are by all critics held to be perfect in their kind, excellent models for imitation, but far above rivalfliip. If the Greek ttage was. fo early brought to maturity, it is a phenomenon not a little Angular in the progrefs of arts. The Greek tragedy made a rapid progrefs from Thefpis to Sophocles and Euripides, whofe compofitions are wonderful produc¬ tions of genius, confidering that the Greeks at that period were but beginning to emerge from roughnefs and barbarity into a tafte for literature. The compo- fitions of Efchylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, muft ART [ 362 ] ART Art. have been highly relilhed among a people who had no ""v ' idea of any thing more perfedl. We judge by com- parifon, and every work is held to be perfect that has no rival. It ought at the fame time to be kept in view, that it was not the dialogue which chiefly en¬ chanted the Athenians, nor variety in the paffions re-r prelented, nor perfection in the a&ors; but machinery and pompous decoration, joined with exquifire mufic",,GR,3,Greece,Europe
"One would imagine, however, that thefe compofi- tions were too Ample to enchant for ever ; as variety in aCIion, fentiment, and paflion, is requiAte, without which the ftage will not continue long a favourite en¬ tertainment : and yet we find not a Angle improve¬ ment attempted after the days of Sophocles and Euri¬ pides. The manner of performance, indeed, prevented abfolutely any improvement. A fluctuation of paflion and refined leutiments would have made no figure on the Grecian fiage. Imagine the difcording fcene be¬ tween Brutus and Catfius ip Julius Caefar to be there exhibited, or the handkerchief in the Moor of Venice : how flight would be their effedt, wEen pronounced in a matk, and through a pipe ? The workings of nature upon the countenance, and the fleCtions of voice ex- preflive of various feelings, fo deeply affecting in mo¬ dern reprefentation would have been entirely loft. If a great genius had arifen with talents for compofing a pathetic tragedy in perfection, he would have made no figure in Greece. An edifice mutt have been ereCted of a moderate fize : new aCtors mutt have been trained to aCt with a bare face, and to pronounce in their own voice. And after all, there remained a greater miracle ftill to be performed, viz. a total reformation of tafte in the people of Athens.

"Comedy. With refpeCt to comedy, it does not appear that the Greek comedy furpafled the tragedy in its progrefs toward perfection. Horace mentions three ftages of Greek comedy. The firtt well fuited to the rough and coarfe manners of the Greeks, when Eupolis, Cra- tinus, and Ariftophanes, wrote. Thefe authors were not afhamed to reprefent on the ftage real perfons, not even ditguifing their names: of which we have a lin¬ king inltance in a comedy of Ariftophanes, called The Clouds, where Socrates is introduced, and moft con- temptuouily treated. This fort of comedy, fparing neither gods nor men, wasreftrained by themagiflrates of Athens, fo far as to prohibit perfons to be named on the ftage. This led writers to do what is done atpre- fent: the characters and manners of known perfons were painted, fo much to the life, that there could be no miftake y and the fatire was indeed heightened by this regulation, as it was an additional pleafure to find out the names that were meant in the reprefentation",Athens,"GR,US",3,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"who flourithedabout 300 years before the Chriftian sera.' v— And this is termed the third Jlage of Greek comedy. s The comedies of Ariftophanes which ftill remain, err not lefs againtt tafte than againft decency. But the Greek comedy is fuppofed to have been confiderably refined by Menander and his cotemporaries. Their works, however, were far from perfection, if we can draw any conjeCture from their imitator Plautus, who wrote about a century later. Plautus was a writer of genius; and it may be realbnably liippoled that his copies did not fall much thort of the originals, at leatt • in matters that can be faithfully copied ; and he thows very little art, either in his compofnions or in the con¬ duct of his pieces. With refpeCt to the former, his plots are wondrous fimple, very little varied,, and very little interefting. The ilibjeCt of almoft every piece is a young man in love with a mufic girl, defiring to pur- chafe her from the procurer, and employing a favour¬ ite flave to cheat his father out of the price ; and the different ways of accompliftting the cheat is all the va riety we find. In fome few of his comedies the ftory rifes to a higher tone, the mulic girl being difeovered to be the daughter of a freeman, which removes every obftruCtion to a marriage between her and her lover",,GR,3,Greece,Europe
"Caufes of Having traced the progrefs of the fine arts toward the dec!:ne maturity, in a fummary way, the decline of thefe arts arts * finecomes next order. An art, in its progrefs toward ar s‘ maturity, is greatly promoted by emulation; and, af¬ ter arriving at maturity, its downfal is no Ids promo¬ ted by it. It is difficult to judge of perfection but by comparifon ; and an artid, ambitious to outdrip his predeceffbrs, cannot fubmit to be an imitator, but mud firike out fomething new, which, in an art advanced to ripenefs, feldom fails to be a degeneracy. This caufe of the decline of the fine arts may be illuflrated by various indances. The perfection of vocal mufic is to accompany paflion, and to enforce fentiment. In ancient Greece, the province of mufic was well under- dood; which being confined within its proper fphere, had an enchanting influence. Harmony at that time w'as very little cultivated, becaufe it was of very little ufe : melody reaches the heart, and it is by it chiefly that a fentiment is enforced, or a paffion (oothed ; har¬ mony, on the contrary, reaches the ear only ; and it is a matter of undoubted experience, that the mod me¬ lodious airs admit but of very fimple harmony. Art- ids, in later times, ignorant why harmony was fo little regarded by the ancients, applied themfelves ferioufly to its cultivation; and they have been wonderfully fuc- cefsful. But they have been fuccefsful at the expence of melody ; which in modern compofitions, generally fpeaking, is loll amid the btaie of harmony. Thefe compofitions tickle the ear by the luxury ofcomplica- ted founds, but feldom make any impreflion on the heart. The Italian opera, in its form, refembles the Greek tragedy, from which it is evidently copied; but very little in fubflance. In the latter, mufic being made fubfervient to fentiment, the dialogue is nervous and fublime : in the former, the whole weight is laid on mufic ; and the dialogue, devoid of fentiment, is weak and fpiritlefs. Redlefs man knows no golden mean, but will be attempting innovations without end By the fame ambition, architedlure has vifibly declined from its perfection. The Ionic was the favourite order when architecture was in its height of glory. The Corinthian order came next; which, in attempting greater perfection, has deviated from the true fimpli- city of nature : and the deviation is (till greater in the Compofite order. With refpeCt to literary productions, the firfl: effays of the Romans were very imperfeCt",,GR,3,Greece,Europe
"We may judge of this from Plautus, whole compofi¬ tions are abundantly rude, though much admired by his cotemporaries, being the bed that exifted at that time. The exalted fpirit of the Romans hurried rhem on to the grand and beautiful ; and literary produc¬ tions of all kinds were in perfection when Auguftus reigned. In attempting dill greater perfection, the Roman compofitions became a drange jumble of incon¬ fident parts: they were tumid and pompous ; and, at the fame time, full of antithefes, conceit, and tinlel wit. Every thing new in the fine arts pleafes, though lefs perfect than what we are accudomed to ; and, for that reafbn, fuch compofitions were generally relidi- ed. We fee not by what gradual deps writers, after the time of Augudus, deviated from the patterns that were before them ; for no book of any moment after that time is preferved till we come down to Seneca, in whole works nature and fimplicity give place to ar¬ tificial thought and badard wit. He was a great cor¬ rupter of the Roman tade ; and after him nothing was relidied but brilliant drokes of fancy, with very little regard to fentiment: even Virgil and Cicero made no figure in comparifon. Lucan has a forced elevation of thought and dyle very difficult to be fup- ported ; and, accordingly, he finks often into puerile reflections; witnefs his encomium on the river Po ; which, fays he, would equal the Danube, had it the 7. z 2 fame ART [ 364 ] ART fame number of tributary ftreams. Quintilian, a wri¬ ter of true and claffical tafte, who was protected and encouraged by Vefpafian, attempted to ftem the tide of falle writing. His rhetoric is eompofed in an ele¬ gant ftyle-; and his oblervations contain every delicacy of the critical art. At the fame time flourifhed Ta- citps, poffc fling a more extenfive knowledge of the nature of man than any other author, ancient or mo¬ dern, if Shakefpeare be,not excepted. His ftyle is ori¬ ginal, concile, compafl, and comprehenfive j and, in what is properly called his hijiory, perfectly correct and beautiful. He has been imitated by feveral, but never equalled by any. Brutus is faid to be the laft of the Romans for love of liberty : Quintilian and Tacitus may be faid to be the laft of the Romans for literary genius. Pliny the younger is no exception 5 his ftyle is affe&ed, turgid, and full of cWldifh brilliancy. Se¬ neca and Pliny are proper examples of writers who ftu- dy fhow more than iubftance, and who make fenfe yield to found. The difference between thefe authors and thofe of the Auguftine age, refembles the difference be¬ tween Greek and Italian Mufic. Mufic, among the Greeks, limited itfelf to the employment to which it is deftined by nature, viz. to be the handmaid of fenfe, to enforce, enliven, or fweeten a fentiment. In the Italian opera, the miftrefs is degraded to be hand¬ maid ; and harmony triumphs, with very little regard to fentiment","Roman, Roman, Cicero, Lucan","RO,US,IE,GR,IT",3,"Romania,United States,Ireland,Greece,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Another great caufe that precipitates the downfal of every fine art is defpotifm. The reafbn is obvious j and there is a difmal example of it in Rome, particularly with regard to eloquence. We learn from a dialogue accounting for the corruption of the Roman eloquence, that in the decline of the art it became fafhionable to fluff harangues with impertinent poetical quotations, without any view but ornament merely ; and this alfo was long fafhionable in France. It happened unlucki¬ ly for the Romans, and for the world, that the fine arts were at their height in Rome, and not much upon the decline in Greece, when delpotifm put an end to the republic. Auguftus, it is true, retarded their fall, par¬ ticularly that of literature ; it being the politic of his reign to hide defpotifm, and to give his government an air of freedom. His court was a fchool of urbani¬ ty, where people of genius acquired that delicacy of tafte, that elevation of fentiment, and that purity of expreflion, which charatlerize the writers of his time","Rome, Roman, Rome","US,FR,GR,RO",3,"United States,France,Greece,Romania","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"He honoured men of learning, admitted them to his table, and was bountiful to them. It would be pain¬ ful to follow the decline of the fine arts in Rome to their total extirpation. The tyranny of Tiberius, and of fubfequent emperors, broke at laft the elevated and- independent fpirit of the brave Romans, reduced them to abjedl flavery, and left not a fpark of genius. The fcience of law is the only exception, as it flourifhed even in the worft of times : the Roman lawyers were a re- fpe£table body, and lefs the obje<5l of jealoufy than men of power and extenfive landed property. Among the,greeks alfo, a conquered people, the fine arts de¬ cayed ; but not fb rapidly as at Rome ; the Greeks, farther removed from the feat of Government, being lefs within the reach of a Roman tyrant.

"We need fcarce any other caufe but defpotifm, to account for the decline of ftatuary and painting in Greece. Thele arts had arrived at their utmoft per- fedlion about the time of Alexander the Great ; and from that time they declined gradually with the vigour of a free people j for Greece was now enflaved by the Macedonian power. It may in general be oblerved, that when a nation becomes ftationafy in that degree of power which it acquires from its conftnution and fi- tuation, the national fpirit fubfides, and men of talents become rare. It is ftill worle with a nation that is funk below its former power and pre-eminence j and worft of all when it is reduced to llavery. Other caui'es concurred to accelerate the downfal of the arts men¬ tioned. Greece, in the days of Alexander, was filled with ftatues of excellent worlcmanftiip ; and there being little demand for more, the later ftatuaries were re¬ duced to heads and bulls. At laft the Romans put a total end both to ftatuary and painting in Greece, by plundering it of its fineft pieces ; and the Greeks, ex- pofed to the avarice of the conquerors, beftowed no longer any money on the fine arts",,"GR,MK",3,"Greece,North Macedonia","Europe,Europe"
"The fame caufe would have been fatal to the arts of ftatuary and painting among the Greeks, even though they had continued a free people. The decay of paint¬ ing in modern Italy is, probably, owing to the fame caufe: Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, &c. are lofty oaks that bear down young plants in their neigh¬ bourhood, and intercept from them the funftiine of e- mulation. Had the art of painting made a flower pro¬ grefs in Italy, it might have there continued in vigour to this day. Velleius Paterculus fays judicioufly, “ Ut primo ad confequendos quos priores ducimus accendi- mur ; ita, ubi aut praeteriri aut aequari eos pofle de- fperavimus, ftudium cum fpe fenefcit; et quod adfe- qui non poteft, fequi definit: praeteritoque eo in quo eminere non poflimus, aliquid in quo nitamur conqui- rimus.” The decline of an art or fcience proceeding from the foregoing caufe, is the moft rapid where a ftri6t com¬ panion can be inftituted between the works of differ¬ ent mailers. The fuperiority of Newton above every other mathematician can be afcertained with precifion; and hence the fudden decline of that fcience in Great Britain. In Italy a talent for painting continued ma¬ ny years in vigour, becaufe no painter appeared with fuch fuperiority of genius as to carry perfection in e- very branch of the art. As one furpafled in defigning, one in colouring, one in graceful attitudes, there was ftillfcope for emulation. But when at laft there was not.a fingle perfection but what one or other mafter had excelled in, from that period the art began to lan¬ guid).

The aera of artillery is dated from the battle of Creffy in 1346, becaufe it is only from that day that cannons were mentioned in battle. Edward III. of England fuccefsfully employed fome pieces of artillery placed in the front of his army. The invention of artillery was then known in France as well as in England ; but pro¬ bably Philip VI. marched with fo much hurry and pre¬ cipitation to attack his enemy, that he left his cannon as ufelefs incumbrances behind him.

"It has to many appeared matter of furprifie, that the battles of the ancients Ihould be defcribed with an or¬ der, perfpicuity, and circumftantial minutenefs, which are not to be found in the military writers of modern times. Scholars have endeavoured to explain this dif¬ ference, by obfierving the immenfe difproportion, in point of dignity and abilities, between the military hi- ftorians of modern Europe and thofe of Greece and Rome. But the difficulty will be better folved, Dr Gillies thinks, by refle&ing on the changes introduced- into the art of w'ar by the change of artillery 5 which in military-operations, form the pivot on which the whole turns. 1. From the nature of fire-arms, modern battles are involved in fmoke and confufion. 2.

"V. “ The chronicle is not once mentioned by any writer of antiquity.” This indeed appears a ftrong ar¬ gument againft its authenticity. Apollodorus, an A- thenian, the difciple of Ariftarchus the grammarian, and Pansetius the philofopher, wrote a genealogical and hiftorical work on the early ages of Greece 5 but, though compofed 120 years after the date of the Pa¬ rian chronicle, it does not contain the fmalleft traces of a fyftematical chronology. It is remarkable too that the chronicle of Apollodorus is quoted by Diodo¬ rus Siculus, Strabo, Plutarch, A. Gellius, Lucian, and many other writers of antiquity; while the Parian chronicle, which comprehends a more extenfive period, is entirely unnoticed. It contains, however, fuch won¬ derful difcoveries in ancient hiftory, that if it had ex- ifted 264 years before the Chriftian sera, it muft have excited a general attention, and been referred to as an authority by writers of fucceeding times. But we do not find, in any author of antiquity, either poet or hi- ftorian, geographer or chronologer, mythologift or fcholiaft, the moft diftant allufion to the Parian chro¬ nicle j though it was fuch a common pra&ice among A R U C 383 ] A R U Antnde- the ancients to mention the works of their predecef- *a- fors, that in many books vve find references and ailu- ' fions to three, four, five, fix, or {even hundred difie- rent authors of every denomination",,GR,3,Greece,Europe
"VI. <f Some of the fads mentioned in the chronicle feem to have been taken from writers of a later date.” Our inquirer collates feveral pafTages in the Parian chronicle with parallel pa flag es in Greek authors, to evince that there i-t, in the former, an appearance of imitation, or a fironger resemblance than fuch as may be fuppofed to arife from accident ; that there are likewile fome improbabilities attending the account of Deucalion, as related in the Parian chronicle; and that the names of fix, and, it the lacunte are properly fup- piied, the names of 12 cities appear to have been en¬ graved on the marble, exactly as we find them in JE.- lian’s Various Hiflory. But there is not, our author obferves, any imaginable reafon for this particular ar¬ rangement.

But about this time, or rather earlier, the Greeks having begun to plant colonies in Italy, Gaul, and Egypt, thefe became acquainted with the Pythagorean fyftem, and ahe notions of the ancient Druids concerning aftronomy. Julius Csefar informs us, that the latter were /killed in this fcience ; and that the Gauls in general were able failors, which at that time they could not be without a competent know¬ ledge of aftronomy : and it is related of Pytheas, who lived at Marfeilles in the time of Alexander the Great, that he obferved the altitude of the fun at the fummer folftice by means of a gnomon.

He was originally bred to the prac- ’ tice of medicine, and had obtained the degree of Do£tor in that faculty : but havingconceived a great regard for the mathematical fciences, efpecially aftronomy, he travelled into Italy, where he for fome time was taught by Dominic Maria, or rather afiifted him in his aftro- nomical operations. On his return to his own country, being made one of the canons of the church, he applied himfelf with the utmoft affiduity to the contemplation of the heavens, and to the ftudy of the celeftial mo¬ tions. He foon perceived the deficiency of all the hy- pothefes by which it had been attempted to account for thefe motions ; and for this reafon he fet himfelf to fludy the works of the ancients, with all of whom he alfo was diffatisfied excepting Pythagoras ; who, as has been already related, placed the fun in the cen¬ tre, and fuppofed all the planets, with the earth it- fe’f, to revolve round him. He informs us, that he began to entertain thefe notions about the year 1507 ; but not being fathfied with dating the general nature of his hypothefis, he became defirous of determining the feveral periodica! revolutions of the planets, and thence of conftru&ing tables of their motions which might be more agreeable to truth than thofe of Ptole¬ my and Alphonfus. The obfervations he was enabled to make, however, muft have been extremely inaccu¬ rate ; as he tells us, that if with the inftruments he made ufe of he Ihould be able to come wifhin ten minutes of the truth, be would rejoice no lefs than Pythagoras did when he difcovered the proportion of the hypothe- nufe to the other two fides of a right-angled triangle",,IT,3,Italy,Europe

In 1571, he difeovered a new liar in the chair of Caffiopeia ; which induced him, like Hip¬ parchus, to make a catalogue of the ftars.. This con¬ tained the places of 777 ftars, rectified to the year »6oo ; but inftead of the moon, which was ufed by the ancients to conned the places of the fun and ftars, Tycho fub- llituted Venus as having little or no parallax, and yet being like the moon vifible both day and night. By the recommendation of the Landgrave of Heffe, he obtained from the king of Denmark the ifland of Hu- enna, oppofite to Copenhagen, where an Obfervatory Account of was built. The firft ftone of this building, afterwards Uraniburg called Uraniburg, was laid in the year 1576. It was his Obferva-0f a fquare form, one fide of it being about 60 feet in tory* length ; and on the eaft and weft fides were two round towers of 32 feet diameter each. The inftruments were more large and folid than had ever been feen be¬ fore by any altronomer. They confifted of quadrants, fextants, circles, femicircles, armiilae both equatorial and zodiacal, parallaftic rulers, rings, aftrolabes, globes, clocks, and fun-dials. Thefe inftruments were fo di¬ vided as to fhow fingle minutes 5 and in fome the arch might be read off to to feconds.

Hiftorr, have amounted to 200,000 crowns. The method of dividing by diagonals, which Tycho greatly admired, was the invention of Mr Richard Chanceler, an Eng- lilhman : Tycho, however, (hows that it is not accu¬ rately true when ftraight lines are employed, and the circles at equal diftances from each other ; but that it may be corre&ed by making circular diagonals, which if continued would pafs through the centre",Copenhagen,DK,3,Denmark,Europe
"Tycho employed his time at Uraniburg to the beft advantage ; but falling into diferedit on the death of the king, he was obliged to remove to Holftein, and at laft found means to get himfelf introduced to the em¬ peror, with whom he continued to his death. He is well known to have been the inventor of a fyttem of aftroromy, which bears his name ; and which he vainly endeavoured to eltablifii on the ruins of that of Copernicus : but the fimplicity and evident con.fo- nancy to the phenomena of nature, difplayed in aH parts of the Copernican fyftem, foon got the better of the unnatural and complicated fyftem of Tycho. His works, however, which are very numerous, difeover him to have been a man of vaft abilities. After his death the caftle of Uranibfirg quickly fell to decay, and in¬ deed leems to have been purpofely pulled down ; for, in 1652, when Mr Fluet went to Sweden, it was almoll level with the ground, and few traces of the walls could be difeerned. None of the neighbouring inhabitants had ever heard of the name of Tycho or Uraniburg, excepting one old man, whom Mr Huet found out with great difficulty, and who had been a fervant in the family.

"While Tycho refided at Prague with the emperor, Difeoveries he invited thither John Kepler, afterwards fo famous °^cP*er* for his difeoveries. Under the tuition of fo great an aftronomer, the latter quickly made an amazing progrefs. He found that his predeceffors had er¬ red in fuppofing the orbits of the planets to be circu¬ lar, and their motions uniform : on the contrary, he perceived from his own obfervations, that they were elliptical, and their motions unequal, having the fun in one of the foci of their orbits ; but that, however they, varied in abfolute velocity, a line drawn from the cen¬ tre of the fun to the planet, and revolving with it, would always deferibe equal areas in equal times. He difeovered, in the year 1618, that the fquares of the periodical times are as the cubes of the diftances of the planets ; two laws which have been of the greateft im¬ portance to the advancement of aftronomy. He feems to have had fome notion of the extenfive power of the principle of gravity : for he tells us, that gravity is a mutual power betwixt two bodies ; that the moon and earth tend towards each other, and would meet in a point nearer the earth than the moon in the proportion of the fuperior magnitude of the former, were they not hindered by their projedlile motions. He adds alfo, that the tides ai ife from the gravitation of the waters to¬ wards the moon : however, he did not adhere fteadily to thefe principles, but afterwards fubftituted others as the caufes of the planetary motions",Prague,CZ,3,Czechia,Europe

"N O M Y. 423 While aftronomers were thus bufy in making new 28 difcoveries, the mathematicians in different countriesLo^n':|'' were no lefs earned!y employed in conftru&ing loga- rithmic tables to facilitate their calculations. Benja¬ min Urfwus, an excellent mathematician of Branden¬ burg, calculated much larger tables of logarithms than had been done by their noble inventor, and publilhed them in 1625. They were improved by Henry Briggs, Savilian profiffor of Oxford; who by making unity the logarithm of ten, thus rendered them much more con¬ venient for the pnrpofes of calculation. Logarithmic tables of fines and tangents were alfo compofed by Mr Briggs and Adrian Vlacq at Goude, fo that the bufi- nefs of calculation was now rendered nearly as eafy as pofiible. 39 In 1633, Mr Horrox, a young aftronomer of very Trasfit of extraordinary talents, difcovered that Venus would pafs Vemis over the difk of the fun on the 24th of November 1639. This event he announced only to one friend, a Mr Crabtree ; and thefe two were the only perfons in the world who obferved this tranfit the firft time it had ever been viewed by human eyes. Mr Horrox made many ufeful obfervations at the time; and had even formed a new theory of the moon, fo ingenious as to attraft the notice of Sir Ifaac Newton : but the hopes of aftronomers from the abilities of this excel¬ lent young man were blafted by his death in the begin¬ ning of January 1640. 30 About the year 1638 many learned men began to Foundation aflemble at Paris in order to hold conferences on dif- ot t*'ie ^ca* ferent fcientific fubjedts, which was the firft; f°untlat>°n ^^5 of the Royal Academy of Sciences in that capital. r;s an(i This pradtice was introduced in France by Merfennus, Royal So- and foon after at London by Oldenburg; which laid defy at the foundation of the Royal Society there.

Now (fuppo¬ fing the bright fpot obferved to be always the fame) whether this motion is an entire turning round, or on¬ ly a libration, is what I dare not pofitively affirm.” In i66(j Mr Caffini again obferved Venus through a telefcope, but could not then perceive any fpots up* on her furface; the reafon of which Du Hamel con- jeftures to have been the fluftuation of the vapours near the horizon, which prevented them from being vifible. However, we hear nothing more of any fpots „ being feen on her diflc till the year 1726; when, on tobferva-”1 * t^ie February, Bianchini, with fome of Cam- tions. pani’s telefcopes of 90 and 10® Roman palms, began to obferve the planet at the altitude of 40° above the horizon, and continued his obfervationa till, by the motion of feveral fpote, he determined the pofition of her axis to be inclined as above mentioned, that the north pole pointed at a circle of latitude drawn through the 20th degree of Aquarius, elevated 15 or 20® above the orbit of Venus. He delineated alfo the figures of feveral fpots which he fuppofed to be feas, and com¬ plimented the king of Portugal and fome other great men by calling them by their names. Though none of Bianchini’s obfervations were continued long enough to know whether the fpots, at the end'of the period affigned for the rotation of the planet, would have been in a different fituation from what they were at the beginning of it 5 yet, from obfervations of two and of four days, he concluded the motion of the fpots Doubts con-be at the rate of 150 per day; at which advance terning the the planet muff turn round either once in 24 days or time ihe ;n 23 hours; but without farther obfervation it could takes up in not be determined which of the two was the period of round her revolution : for if an obferver fhould at a particular axis. lioufy fuppofe feven in the evening, mark exactly the place of a fpot, and at the fame hour next evening find the fpot advanced 150, he would not be able to determine whether the fpot had advanced only 150, or had gone once quite round with the addition of 15^ more in part of another rotation. Mr Bianchini, however, fuppofes Venus to revolve in 24 days eight hours ; the principal proof adduced for which is an obfervation of three fpots, A B G, being fituated as Plate in fig. 44. when they were viewed by himfelf and fe- XXVI. veral perfons of diftin&ion forabout an hour, during which they could not perceive any change of place","Jupiter, Roman","PT,US,RO",3,"Portugal,United States,Romania","Europe,North America,Europe"
"“ Now (fays Mr Bianehini) if her rotation were fo fwift as to go round in 23 hours, in this fecond view, three hours after the former) the fpots mult have ad- N O M Y. 437 vanced near 50 degrees; fo that the fpot C would-Appearan- have been gone off at R, the fpot B would have fuc-^ ex¬ ceeded into the place of C, the fpot A into the plac , la ^ ’ 1S,’ of B, and there would have been no more but two fpots, A and B, to have been feen.” 73 Calfini, the fon, in a memoir for 1732, denies the Dif’ utc be- conclufion of Bianchini to be certain. He lays, that,tW!xr (-'afli- during the three hours interval, the fpot C might be gone off the difk, and the fpot B got into the place thereof, where, being near the edge, it would appear lefs than in the middle. That A, fucceeding into the place of B, would appear larger than it had done near the edge, and that another fpot might come into the place of A; and there were other fpots befides thefe three on the globe of the planet, as appears by the fi¬ gures of Bianehini himfdf, particularly one which would naturally come in the place of A. That if the rotation of Venus be fuppofed to be in 23 hours, it will agree with Bianchini’s obfervations, as well as with thofe of his father ; but that, on the other fuppofition, the latter muff be entirely rejefted as erroneous: and be concludes with telling us, that Venus had frequent¬ ly been obferved in the moft favourable times by Mr Maraldi and himfelf with excellent telefcopes of 80 and loo feet focus, without their being able to fee any di- flinft fpot upon her difk. “ Perhaps, (fays Dr Long)) thofe feen by Bianchini had difappeared, or the air in France was not clear enough ; which lafl might be the reafon why his father could never fee thofe fpots in France which he had obferved in Italy, even when he made ufe of the longeft telefcopes.” Neither of thefe aftronomers take notice of any indentings in the curve which divides the illuminated part from the dark in the difk of Venus, though in fome views of that planet by Fontana and Ricciolus, the curve is indented ; and it has from thence been concluded, that the furface of the planet is mountainous like that of the moon. This had alfo been fuppofed by Burratini, already mention¬ ed ; and a late writer has obferved, that ‘‘when the air is in a good ftate for obfervation, mountains like thofe of the moon may be obferved with a very power¬ ful telefcope.” 74 Caffini, befides the difeovery of the fpots on the diflc CalTini diP of Venus by which he was enabled to afeertain her re-cov^.s her volution on an axis, had alfo a view of her fatellite orla e lte* moon, of which he gives the following account.-—- “ A. D. 1686, Aug. 28th, at 15 minutes after four in the morning, looking at Venus with a teleicope of 34 feet, I faw, at the diftance of one third of her dia¬ meter eaftward, a luminous appearance, of a fhape not well defined, that feemed to have the fame phafe with Venus, which was then gibbous on the wetttrn fide",Fontana,"FR,IT,US",3,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"From this time the fatellite of Venus, though very frequently looked for by aftronomers, could never be perceive^ which made it generally believed that Caffi- ni and Mr Short had been miftaken ; but as the tran- fits of the planet over the fun in 1761 and 1769 feem- ed to promife a greater certainty of finding it, the fa¬ tellite was very carefully looked for by almoft every one who had an opportunity of feeing the tranfit, but generally without fuccefs. Mr Baudouin at Paris had provided a telefcope of 25 feet, in order to obferve the paffage of the planet over the fun, and to look for its M^ne^tellite ; but he did not fucceed either at that time or at the tran-in the months of April and May following. Mr Mon- fit in 1761. taigne, however, one of the members of the Society of .Limoges, had better fuccefs. On the 3d of May 1761, he perceived, about half an hour after nine at night, at the diftance of 20' from Venus,, a fmall cref- oent, with the horns pointing the fame way as thofe of the planet 5 the diameter of the former being about one-fourth of that of the latter; and a line drawn from Venus to the fatellite making an angle with the verti¬ cal of about 20^ towards the fouth. But though he repeated this obfervation feveral times, fome doubt re¬ mained whether it was not a fmall ftar. Next day he faw the fame ftaj at the fame hour, diftant from Venus about half, a minute, or a minute more than before, and making with the vertical an angle of io° below on the north fide ; fo that the fatellite feemed to have defcribed an arc of about 30°, whereof Venus was the centre, and the radius 20'.

"Some of the French aftronomers attributed this lu¬ minous ring round Venus to the inflexion of the fun’s rays, as they alfo do the light feen round the moon in foiar eclipfes ; but Mr Chappe fuppofes it to have been owing to the fun enlightening more than one half of the planetary globe, though he owns this caufe not to be altogether fufficient. Mr Fouchy, who obferved the tranfit at La Muette in France, perceived, during *he whole time, a kind of ring round Venus, brighter than the reff of the fun, which became fainter the far¬ ther it went from the planet, but appeared more vivid O N O M Y. 439 in proportion as the fun was clearer. Mr Ferner, Appearan- who obferved at the fame place, confirms the tefti-“s mony of Mr Fouchy. “ During the whole time (fays , 0 iea; he) of my obferving with the telefcope, and the blue and green glaffes, 1 perceived a light round about Ve¬ nus, which followed her like a luminous atmofpherc more or lefs lively, afccording as the air was more or kfs clear. Its extent altered in the fame manner ; nor was it well terminated, throwing out, at it were, fome feeble rays on all fides.” “ I am not clear, (fays Dr Long) as to the mean-Dr Long’s ing of the luminous circle here mentioned, whether, 0pini0n on when the whole planet was upon the fun, they faw athefe obfer- ring of light round it, diftinfl: from the light of thevad°ns* fun ; or whether they mean only the light which fur¬ rounded that part of Venus that was not upon the fun.” Mr Chappe takes this and other accounts of the obfervations made in France in this latter fenfe ; and though he fometimes called the luminous part of the crefcent that furrounded the part of the planet not upon the fun a ring, he explains himfelf that he did fo, becaufe at the coming upon the fun he perceived it at one fide of the planet, and on the oppofite fide on its going off: for which reafon he fuppofed that it furrounded it on all fides.

"5. Much larger and more remarkable fpots have been perceived on the difk of Mars than that of any other primary planet.

The planet was obferved by fome aftronomers at Rome with longer telefcopes made by Euttachio Divini ; but they affigned to it a rotation in 13 hours only. This, however, was af¬ terwards fhown by Mr Caflini to have been a mif- take, and to have arifen from their not diftinguifning the oppofite fides of the planer, which it feems have fpots pretty much alike. He made further obferva¬ tions ou the fpots of this planet in 1670; from whence he drew an additional confirmation of the time the planet took to revolve. The fpots were again obfer¬ ved in fubfequent oppofitions ; particularly for feveral days in 1704 by Maraldi, who took notice that they were not always well defined, and that they not only changed their fhape frequently in the fpace between two oppofitions, but even in the fpace of a month","Much, Bologna, Rome","DE,IT,US",3,"Germany,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

Fig. 85, ta-tl’e ken from Newton’s Pripcipia, reprefents fo much ofot 1 the traje&ory of this comet as it paffed through while it was vifible to the inhabitants of our earth, in going from and returning to its perihelion. It {hows alfo the tail, as k appeared on the days mentioned in the figure. The tail, like that of other comets, increafed in length and brighthefs as it came nearer to the fun ; and grew fhorter and fainter as it went farther from him and from the earth, till that and the comet were too far.off to be any longer vifible. uj “ The comet of 1744 was firft feen at Laufanne in Of that of Switzerland, Dec. J3th, 1743, From that time1?44, it increafed in brightnefs and magnitude as it was co¬ ming nearer to the fun. The diameter of it, when at the diftance of the fun from us, meafured about one minute 5 which brings it out equal to three times the diameter of the earth. It came fo near Mercury, that, if its attraffion had been proportionable to its magni¬ tude, it was thought probable it would have difturbed the motion of that planet. Mr Betts of Oxford, how¬ ever, from fome obfervations made there, and at Lord Macclesfield’s obfervatory at Sherburn, found, that when the comet was at its leaft diftance from Mercury, and almoft twice as near the fun as that planet was, it was ftill diftant from him a fifth part of the diftance of the fun from the earth ; and could therefore have no effedf upon the planet’s motions. He judged the co¬ met to be at leaft equal in magnitude to the earth.

As a fpecimen of what were the opinions of the°Piniofls °f ancient philofophers concerning the nature of the fun, eancients it may fuffice to mention, that Anaximander and Anaxi- menes held, that there was a circle of fire all along the heavens, which they called the circle of the fun ; be¬ tween the earth and this fiery circle was placed another circle of fome opaque matter, in which there was a hole like the mouth of a German flute. Through this hole the light was tranfmitted, and appeared to the inhabi¬ tants of this earth as a round and diftinft body of firei The eclipfes of the fun were occafioned by flopping this hole",,DE,3,Germany,Europe
"vbich fhe would be viuble without being illuminated by the fun-beams. In proof of this it is urged, that j during the time of even total eclipfes the moon is ftill vifible, appearing of a dull red colour, as if obfcured by a great deal of fmoke. In reply to this it hath been advanced, that this is not always the cafe ; the moon fometimes difappearing totally in the time of an eclipfe, fo as not to be difcernible by the beft glaf* fes, while little ftars of the fifth and fixth magnitudes were diftindtly feen as ufual. This phenomenon was obferved by Kepler twice, in the years 1580 and 1583 ; and by Hevelius in 1620.

The general reafon for her appearance at all during the time of eclipfes fhall be given afterwards : but as for thefe particular phenomena, they have not yet, as far as we know, been fatisfafkorily accounted for",Avignon,FR,3,France,Europe
"There is, however, a ftrong argument in favour of the exiftence of a lunar atmofphere, taken from the appearance of a luminous ring round the moon in the time of folar eclipfes. In the eclipfe of May i. 1706, Captain Stanyan, from Bern in Switzerland, writes, that “ the fun was totally darkened there for the fpace of four minutes and a half: that a fixed liar and pla¬ net appeared very bright: that his getting out of the eclipfe was preceded by a-blood-red Itreak of light from his left limb, which continued not longer than fix or feven feconds of time ; then part of the fun’s dilk appeared, all on a fudden, brighter than Venus was ever feen in the night; and in that very inftant gave light and (hadow to things as ftrong as moon-light ufes to do.” The publilher of this account obferves, that the red ftreak of light preceding the emerfion of the fun’s body, is a proof that the moon has an atmo¬ fphere ; and its fiiort continuance of five or fix feconds Ihows that its height is not more than the five or fix hundredth part of her diameter",Bern,CH,3,Switzerland,Europe
"Fatio, who obferved the fame eclipfe at Geneva, tells us, that “ there was feen during the whole time of the total immerfion, a whitenefs which feemed to break out from behind the moon, and to encompafs her on all fides equally : this whitenefs was not .well defined on its outward fide, and the breadth of it was not a twelfth part of the diameter of the moon. The planet appeared very black, and her diik very well de¬ fined within the whitenefs which encompaffed it about, and was of the fame colour as that of a white crown «r halo of about four or five degrees in diameter, which accompanied it, and had the moon for its centre. A little after the fun had begun to appear again, the whitenefs, and the crown which had encompaffed the moon, did entire]^’ vanifh.” “ I muft add (fays Dr .Long), that this defeription is a little perplexed, ei¬ ther through the fault of the author or of the tranf- lator; for I fuppofe Fatio wrote in French : however, it plainly appears by it that the moon’s atmofphere was ■vifible, furrounded by a light of larger extent, which - N O M Y.

"Occulta- ^as already been obferved, that the occultations of tions of the fixed ftars and planets by the moon, in general hap* fixed ftars pen without any kind of refradb'on of their light by by the the lunar atmofphere. The contrary, however, has anoon. fometimes been obferved, and the ftars have been feen manifeftly to change their lhape and colour on going behind the moon’s dilk. An inftance of this happen¬ ed on the 28th of June N. S. in the year 1715, when an occultation of Venus by the moon happened in the day-time. Some aftronomers in France obferving this with a telefcope, faw Venus change colour for about a minute before (he was hid by the moon ; and the fame change of colour was obferved immediately after her emerfion from behind the diflt. At both times the edge of the di(k of Venus that was neareft the moon appeared reddifh, and that which was moft diftant of a bluilh, colour. Thefe appearances, however, which might have been taken for proofs of a lunar atmo¬ fphere, were fuppofed to be owing to the obfervers ha¬ ving diredted the axis of their telefcopes towards the moon. This would neceflarily caufe any planet or ftar near the edge of the moon’s di(k to be^feen through thofe parts of the glaffes which are neat their circum¬ ference, and cdnfcquently to appear coloured. This N O M Y. Sefl.

Maraldi alfo informs us, that he had obferved before this two other occultations of Venus and one of Jupiter; and was always attentive to fee whether thofe planets changed their figure or colour either up¬ on the approach of the moon to cover them, or at their firft coming again into fight; but never could perceive any fuch thing. Nor could he, in a great number of occultations of the fixed ftars, perceive the fmalleft apparent change in any of them, except¬ ing once that a fixed ftar feemed to increafe its di- ftance a little from the moon as it was going to be co* vered by her; but this, he fufpedted, might be owing to his telefcope being diredted fo as to have the flat feen too far from the middle of its aperture. He con¬ cludes, therefore, that the moon has no atmofphere s and he remarks, that at Montpelier, perhaps becaufe the air is clearer there than at London, the luminous ring round the moon appeared much larger than at London ; that it was very white near the moon, and, gradually decreafing in brightnefs, formed round her a circular area of about eight degrees in diameter","Jupiter, Jupiter, London, London","US,GB,FR",3,"United States,United Kingdom,France","North America,Europe,Europe"
"If, fays he, this light was Caufed by the atmofphere of the moon, of what a prodigious extent tnuft that at¬ mofphere be ? Before we enter upon any further fpeculations con-Ofapla* cerning the celeftial bodies, we (hall here take fome no-ral‘ty tice of the dodtrine of a plurality of worlds; towords' which we are naturally led by the queftion, Whether the moon is inhabited or not ? This is an hypothefis of very ancient date, and which in modern times has been revived in fuch a manner as now to be almoft adopted as an undoubted truth. Plutarch, Diogenes, Laertius, and Stobseus, inform us, that this dodtrine was embraced by feveral of the ancient Greek philofo- phers; from which authors Gregory has given us ex- tradfs in the Preface to his Aftronomy. “ Among the moderns (fays Dr Long), Huygens has written a treatife, which he calls Cofmotheoros, or A view of the world, worth perufing. One thing, however, 1 muft find fault with ; that, in peopling the planets withrea- fonable creatures, he infifts upon their being in all points exadtly fimilar to the human race, as to the (hape of their bodies and the endowments of their minds : this is too confined a thought; for we cannot but ac¬ knowledge that infinite Power and Wlfdom is able to form rational beings of various kinds, not only in (hape and figure different from the human, but endowed alfo with faculties and fenfes very different; fuch as in our prefent (late we can have no idea of.” With regard to the probability of the dodtrine itfelf, the Dodtor expreffes himfelf in the following manner : “ Thatthe earth and all the creatures thereon were created to be fubfervient to the ufe of man, we may believe uj)on the authority of the facred writer, Pfalm viii. but that the ftars and planets were formed only to befpangle the canopy of heaven with their glimmering, which does not furnilh us with the twentieth part of the light the moon gives, I think is,not at all probable : this is con¬ trary to the obfervation made by the beft philofophers, that nature is magnificent in all her defigns, but frugal in the execution of them.

"Thus it is fcarcely to be imagined that we can err in concluding, that the eyes, ears, legs, wings, and other parts of animals, were ftiade for the purpofes of feeing, hearing, walking, flying, and fo forth. Neither can we avoid inferring, that the Power who conftrudfed li¬ ving creatures with mouths, teeth, and organs to digeft- and afilmilate food for their nutriment, did likewife form other organized bodies, which we call vegetables, for the exprefs purpofe of affording that food.

The earth is Ihown to be a planet in eireum-^^*^^ ftances very fimilar to the other five: we know 'ts tjje pianets: final caufe—to fupport a number of inhabitants : And by analogy we may conclude, that the others are alfo habitable worlds ; though, from their different pro¬ portions of heat, it is credible that beings of our make and temperature could not live upon them. However, even that can fcarcely be affirmed of all the planets; for the warmelt climate on the planet Mars is not colder than many parts of Norway or Lapland are in the fpring or autumn. Jupiter, Saturn, and the Geor¬ gium Sidus, it muft be granted, are colder than any of the inhabited parts of our globe. The greateit heat on the planet Venus exceeds the heat on the ifland of St Thomas on the coaft of Guinea, or Sumatra in the Eaft Indies, about as much as the heat in thofe places exceeds that of the Orkney iflands, or the city of Stockholm in Sweden : therefore, at 6o° north latitude on that planet, if its axis were perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the heat would not exceed the greateft heat on the earth ; and of courfe vegeta¬ tion like ours might be there carried on, and animals of the fpecies on earth might fubfift.

Out of this ifland there was an eafy paflage into fome others, which lay near a large continent exceeding in bignefs all Europe and Afia. Neptune fettled in this ifland (from whofe fon Atlas its name was derived), and divided it among his ten fons. To the youngeft fell the extremity of the ifland, called Gadtr, which in the language of the country fignifies fertile, or abundant in Jkeep. The defcehdants of Neptune reigned here from father to Ton for a great number of generations in the order of primogeniture, during the fpace of 9000 years. They alfo poffefled feveral other iflands; and, palling into Europe and Africa, fubdued all Libya as far as Egypt, and all Europe to Afia Minor. At length the ifland funk under water ; and for a long time afterwards the fea thereabouts was full of rocks and /helves. ” Many of the moderns alfo are of opinion, that the exiilehce of the Atlantis is not to be looked upon as entirely fabulous. Some take it to have been Ameri¬ ca ; and from thence, as well as from a paflage in Se¬ neca’s Medea, and fome other obfcure hints, they imagine that the new world was not unknown to the ancients. But allowing this to be the cafe, the above- mentioned continent which wras faid to lie beyond At¬ lantis would feem rather to have been the continent of America than Atlantis itfelf. The learned Rudbeck, profeflbr in the univerlity of Upfal, in a work intitled Atlantica five Manbeim, endeavours to prove that Swe¬ den and Norway are the Atlantis of the ancients; but this its fituation will by no means allow us to believe","Plato, Plato, Atlantis, Atlantis, Atlantis","ZA,CO,LY,EG,NO",3,"South Africa,Colombia,Libya,Egypt,Norway","Africa,South America,Africa,Africa,Europe"

A very remarkable one of this kind was obferved by Dr Halley in the month of March 1719, whofe altitude he computed to have ' been between 69 and 734- Englifh miles ; its diameter 2800 yards, or upwards of a mile and an half; and its velocity about 350 miles in a minute.

On the human body the quantity of preffure fometimes varies near a whole tun; and when it is thus fo much diminiftied, moft people find fomething of a liftleflhefs and inactivity about them. It is furprifing, however, that the fpring of the internal fluid, already mentioned, which aCts as a counterpoife to the atmo¬ fpherical gravity, ftiould in all cafes feem to keep pace with it when the preffure is naturally diminiihed, and even when it is artificially augmented, though not when the preffure is artificially diminiflied. Thus in that kind of weather when the preffure of the air is leaft, wre never perceive our veins to fwell, or are fen- fible of any inward expanfion in our bodies. On the contrary, the circulation is languid, and we feem ra- I4 j ther to be oppreffed by a weight.

They landed in the ifle of Thanet; and having fent fome Frenph interpreters to king Ethelbert with an account of their errand, the king gave them leave to convert as many of his fub- je&s as they could, and affigned their place of refi- dence at Dorovernum, fince called Canterbury; to which they were confined till the king himfelf was con¬ verted, whofe example had a powerful infldence in pro¬ moting the converfion of his fubje&s; but though he was extremely pleafed at their becoming Chriftians, he never attempted to compel them. He difpatched a prieft and a monk to Rome, to acquaint the pope with the fuccefs of his million, and to defire his refolution of certain queftions. Thefe men brought back with them a pall, and feveral, books, veftments, uterifils, and ornaments for the churches. His holinefs, by the lame meflengers, gave Auguftin directions concerning the fettling of epifcopal fees in Britain ; and ordered him not to pull down the idol temples, but to convert them into Chriftian churches; only deftroying the idols, and fprinkling the place with holy water, that the natives, by frequenting the temples they had been always ac- cuftomed to, might be the lefs Ihocked at their entrance into Chriftianity. Auguftin refided principally at Can¬ terbury, which thus became the metropolitan church of England ; and having eftablifhed bilhops in feveral of the cities, he died on the 26th of May 607.

"hemifphere, or whether it was alfo to be obferved near^°1^“ the fouth pole. This is now afcertained by Mr For- pearances fter ; who in his late voyage round the world along in the with Captain Cook, affures us, that he obfcrved them fouthem in the high fouthern latitudes, though with phenome- na fomewhat different from thofe which are feen here. "" On Feb. 17. 1773, as they were in Lat. 580 fouth, “ a beautiful phenomenon (fays he) was obferved du¬ ring the preceding night, which appeared again this and fcveral following nights. It confided of long co¬ lumns of a clear white light, {hooting up from the ho¬ rizon to the eadward, almod to the zenith, and gra¬ dually fpreading on the whole fouthern part of the fky. Thefe columns were fometimes bent fidewiie at their upper extremities; and though in mod refpeds fimilar to the northern lights (aurora borealis) of our hemiiphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitifh colour, whereas ours affume various tints, e- fpecially thofe of a fiery and purple hue. The fky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air fharp and cold, the thermometer Handing at the freezing point.” Dr Halley obferved that the aurora borealis defcri-R;fcs4vcr? bed by him arofc to a prodigious height, it being fcen high, from the wed of Ireland to the confines of Ruffia and Poland on the ead; nor did he know hew much further it might have been vifibie ; fo that it extended at lead 30 degrees in longitude, and from lat. 50° north it was feen over all the northern part of Europe ; and what was very furprifing, in all thofe places where it was vi¬ fibie, the fame appearances were exhibited which Dr Halley obferved at London. He obferves, with feem- ing regret, that he could by no means-determine its height, for want of obfervations made at different pla¬ ces ; otherwifc he might as eafily have calculated the height of this aurora borealis as he did of the fiery globe in 1719*. To other philofophers, however, he t See gives the following exhortation. “When frherefore^,„/ * for the future any fueh thing fhall happen, all thofe ^ that are curious in allronomical matters are hereby admonijhed and intreated to fet their clocks to the apparent time at London, for example, by allowing fo many minutes as is the difference of meridians; and then to note, at the end of every half hour precifcly, the exaft fituation of what at that time appears remarkable in the iky; and particularly the azimuths of thofc very tall pyramids fo eminent above the red, and there¬ fore likely to be fcen furthed : to the intent that, by comparing thefe obfervations taken at the fame mo¬ ment in didant places, the difference of their azimuths may fcrve to determine how far thefe pyramids are di¬ dant from us.” This advice of Dr Halley feems to have been totally negletted by all the philofophical peo¬ ple in this country. In other countries, however, they A U R [ <594 1 A U R Aurora have been more induftrious. Father Bofcovich has , Borealis, determined the height of an aurora borealis, obferved on the 16th of December 1737 by the Marquis of Po- leni, to have been 825 miles high ; the celebrated Mr Bergman, from a mean of 30 computations, makes the average height of the aurora borealis to be 70 Swedifh, or upwards of 460 Englifh miles. Euler fuppofes it to be feveral thoufands of miles high ; and Mai- ran alfo affigns them a very elevated region. In the 74 th volume of the Philofophical Tranfaftions, Dr Blagden, when fpeaking of the height of fome fiery meteors, tells us, that the “ aurora borealis appears to occupy as high, if not a higher region above the fur- face of the earth, as may be judged from the very diftant countries to which it has been vifible at the fame time.” The height of thefe meteors, however, none of which appear to have exceeded or even ar¬ rived at the height of a hundred miles, muft appear trifling in comparifon of the vaft elevations above mentioned. But thefe enormous heights varying fo exceedingly, fhow that the calculators have not had proper data to proceed upon ; and indeed the im- menfe extent of fpace occupied by the aurora bo¬ realis itfelf, with its conftant motion, muft make it infinitely more difficult to determine the height of it than of a fiery globe, which occupies but a fmall por¬ tion of the vifible heavens. The moft certain method of making a comparifon betwixt the aurora borealis and the meteors already mentioned, would be, if a ball of fire fhould happen to pafs through the fame part of the heavens where an aurora borealis Was ; when the comparative height of both could eafily be afcertained","London, London, Aurora","GB,IE,PL,US",3,"United Kingdom,Ireland,Poland,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"
"terrible kind, immenfe quantities of the eledlric fluid aie thus communicated to the earth, and the inferior warm atmofphere having once exhaulled itfelf, muft ue- ceffarily [ 695 3 A U R r 696 ] A u R Aurora cefTanlj' be recruited from the upper and colder re- grfa 1S'. gion. This becomes very probable from what the French mathematicians obferved when on the top of one of the Andes. They were often involved in clouds, which, finking down into the warmer air, ap¬ peared there to be highly eleftrified, and difcharged themfelves in violent tempefls of thunder and light¬ ning ; while in the mean time, on the top of the mountain, they enjoyed a calm and ferene Iky. In the temperate and frigid zones, the inferior parts of the atmofphere never being fo ftrongly heated, do not part with their eledlricity fo eafily as in the torrid zone, and confequently do not require fuch recruits from the upper regions ; but notwithftanding the difference of heat obferved in different parts of the earth near the furface, it is very probable that at confiderable heights the degree of cold is nearly equal all round it. Were there a like equality in the heat of the under part, there could never be any confiderable lofs of equili- brium in the ele&ricity of the atmofphere : but as the hot air of the torrid zone is perpetually bringing down vaft. quantities of ele&ric matter from the cold air that lies direftly above it; and as the inferior parts of the atmofphere lying towards the north and fouth poles do not conduct in any great degree ; it thence follows, that the upper parts of the atmofphere lying oyer the torrid zone will continually require a fupply from the northern and fouthern regions. This eafily fhows the neceffity of an eledlric current in the upper parts of the atmofphere from each pole towards the equator : and thus we are ajfo furnilhed with a reafon why the au¬ rora borealis appears more frequently in winter than in fummer ; namely, becaufe at that time the electric power of the inferior atmofphere is greater on account of the cold than in fummer; and confequently the abundant ele&ricity of the upper regions muff go al- moft wholly oft' to the equatorial parts, it being impof- fible for it to get down to the earth : hence alfo the aurora borealis appears very frequent and bright in the frigid zones, the degree of cold in the u{)per and un¬ der regions of the atmofphere being much more nearly equal in thefe parts than in any other. ' In feme parts of Siberia particularly, this meteor appears conftantly from October to Chriilmas, and its corrufcations are faid to be very terrifying. Travellers agree, that here the aurora borealis appears in greateft perfe&ion ; and it is to be remarked, that Siberia is the coldelt coun¬ try on earth. In confirmation of this, it may alfo be obferved, that, from the experiments hitherto made with the ele&rical kite, the air appears confiderably more eledlrical in winter than in fummer, though the clouds are known to be often molt violently electrified in the fummer time; a proof that the eledtricity na¬ turally belonging, to the air is in fummer much more powerfully drawn off by the clouds than in the winter, owing to the excefs of heat in fummer, as already ob- krved",Aurora,"US,FR",3,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"It now remains to explain only one particularity of the aurora borealis, namely, that its ftreams do not al¬ ways move with rapidity, fometimes appearing quite ftationary for a confiderable time, and fometimes being carried in different diredions with a flow motion. To this indeed we can give no other reply, than that weak eledric lights have been fometimes obferved to put on the fame appearance at the furface of the earth ; and much more may we fuppofe them capable of do¬ ing fo at great heights above it, where the conduc¬ tors are both fewer irr number and much more imper- fed. When M. de Romas was making experiments with an eledric kite in Italy, a cylinder of blue light about four or five inches diameter was obferved fur¬ rounding the firing. This was in the day-time ; but had it been night, he imagined it muft have been four or five feet in diameter; mid as the firing was 780 feet long, it would probably have feemed pyramidal, point¬ ing upwards like one of the ftreams of the aurora bo¬ realis. A ftill more remarkable appearance. Dr Prieft- ley tells us, was obferved by Mr Hartman. He had been making eledrical experiments for four or five hours together in a very fmall room; and upon going out of it, and returning with a light in his hand, walk¬ ing pretty quick, he perceived a fmall flame following him at about three feet diftanee. Being alarmed at this appearance, he flopped to examine it, upon which it vanilhed. This laft inftance is very remarkable, and fin* gular in its kind : from both, however, we are fuffici- ently warranted to conclude, that fmall portions of our atmofpheve may by various caufes be fo much eiedri- 5 A U R [ 697 ] A U R Aurora fied as to ftiine, and likewife be moved from one place Boreahr. tQ anot[ier without parting with the elettricity they have received, for a confideiable time",Aurora,"IT,US",3,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"The corona, or circle, which is often formed near the zenith by the aurora borealis, is eafily accounted for in the fame manner. As this corona is commonly fta- tionary for fome time, we imagine it would be a very proper mark whereby to determine the diftanCe of the meteor itfelf. If an aurora borealis, for inftance, was obferved by two perfors, one at London, and the other at Edinburgh ; by noting the liars among which the corona was obferved at each place, its true altitude from the furface of the earth could eafily be determi¬ ned by trigonometry","London, Edinburgh",GB,3,United Kingdom,Europe
"If therefore one of thefe 'places happens to be in the Atlantic ocean near the coaft of France, or in the bay of Bifcay, the eledlric matter which has been received at the equator during an aurora borealis will be dif- charged there fome time after, and confequently a wind will blow from that quarter, which will be from the fouth-weft to thofe fhips which are in the Euglifti 4 T channel",,FR,3,France,Europe

Hence thofe maxims fo frequent among their cafuifts, thaf he who does not- take the neceffary meafures to leave heirs behind him, is not a man, but ought to be reputed a homicide.— Lycurgus was not more favourable: by his laws, bachelors are branded with infamy, excluded from all offices civil and military, and even from the (hows and public fports. At certain feafts they were forced to appear, to be expofed to the public derifion, and led round the market-place. At one of their fealls, the women led them in this condition to the altars, where they obliged them to make amende honourable to nature, accompanied with a number of blows and lalhes with a rod at difcretion.

Abun¬ dance of linen, and difufe of ointments, render the pra&ice lefs neceffary in modern life ; but the ancients performed no exercife, engaged in no ftudy, without previous ablutions, which at Rome required an enor- mousexpence inaquedu<fts,ftoves,andattendants: aplace therefore, where waters naturally heated to everydegree of warmth bubbled fpontaneoufly out of the ground, in the pleafanteft of all fituations, was fuch a treafure as could not be overlooked.

"The balance is of two kinds: the ancient and the modern. The ancient or Roman, called alfo, the Jla- tera Romana, or fteel-yard, confifts of a lever or beam, moveable on a centre, and fufpended near one of its extremities: the bodies to be weighed are applied on the balance, will (how the weight of the body re¬ quired ; provided the weight of the counterpoife i be known, and the large divifions, 1, 2, 3, &c. be equal to the diftance between the centre of the balance and the fcrew which fattens the guard c to the fhorter arm of the balance. It will alfo be neceffary that the fteel- yard itfelf, with its whole apparatus, exclufive of the counterpoife, be in equilibrio, when fufpended on the ring k. If the body to be weighed be heavier than the divifions on the longer arm will indicate, the balance is turned the lower fide upwards, and fufpended on the e fide of the centre ; and their weight is fhown by other ring £; by which means the divifions become the divifion marked on the beam, where the weight, which is moveable along the lever, keeps the fteel-yard in equilibrio. This balance is ftill frequently ufed in weighing heavy bodies",Roman,RO,3,Romania,Europe
"It follows, from what has been obferved, therefore, that in the Roman balance, the weight ufed for a coun¬ terpoife is the fame, but the points of application varies; in the common balance the counterpoife is various, and the point of application the fame.

It would lead us too far to enter more minutely into the defcription of this aftonilhing edifice. The lovers of the arts will find it defcribed with the greateft truth and accuracy in a work publifhed at London in 1757, under the title of Ruins of Balbec. This work, compiled by Mr Ro¬ bert Wood, the world owes to the attention and libe¬ rality of Mr Daw'kins, who in 1751 vifited Balbec and Palmyra. But feveral changes, however, have taken place fince their journey : for example, they found nine large columns (landing; and in 17S4 Mr Volney found but fix. They reckoned 29 at the lefler temple ; but there now remain but 20 ; the others have been overthrown by the earthquake of 1759. It has likewife fo (haken the walls of the leffer temple, that the done of the foffit, or croft (lone at the top of the gate, has (lid between the two adjoining ones, and de- of their refearches, added to the opprefiions and ex-' tortions of the governors, who have made their fup- pofed difcoveries a pretext, have at length difiieartened them ; but they imagine the Europeans would be more fuccefsful; nor would it be pofiible to perfuade them but what we are pofieffed of the magic art of deftroy- ing talifmans. It is in vain to oppofe reafon to igno* ranee and prejudice : and it would be no left ridicu¬ lous to attempt to prove to them, that Solomon never was acquainted with the Corinthian order* which was only in ufe under the Roman emperors. But their tradition on the fubjeft of this prince may fugged three important obfervations. Firft, That all tradition re¬ lative to high antiquity is as falfe arpong the Orientals as the Europeans. With them, as with us, fadts which happened 100 years before, when not preferred in wri¬ ting, are altered, mutilated, or forgotten. To expedb information from them with refp'edl to events in the time of Davitl or Alexander, would be as abfurdas to make inquiries of the Flemilh peafants concerning Clo- Charlemagne. Secondly, That throughout Sy- feended eight inches; by which means the body of ria, the Mahometans, as well as the Jews and Chridians, the bird fculptured on that done is fufpended detached from its wings and the two garlands which hung from its beak, and terminated in two genii Nature alone has not effected this devadation ; the Turks have had their (hare in the dedrudlion of the columns. Their motive is to procure the iron cramps, which ferve to join the feveral blocks of which each column is com- pofed. Thefe Cramps anfwer fo well the end intend- attribute every great work to Solomon : not that the memory of him dill remains by tradition in thofe coun¬ tries, but from certain paffages in the Old Tedament; which, with the gofpel, is thefource of almod all their tradition, as thefe are the only hidorical books read or known ; but as their expounders are very ignorant, their applications of what they are told are generally very remote from truth : by an error of this kind, they ed, that feveral of the columns are not even disjointed pretend Balbec is the houfe of the forejl of Lebanon built by their fall; one, among others, as Mr Wood ob- ferves, has penetrated a done of the temple wall with¬ out giving way ; nothing can furpafs the workmanfhip of thefe columns ; they are joined without any cement, yet there is not room for the blade of a knife between their interdices. After fo many ages, they in gene¬ ral (HU retain their original whitenefs. But what is dill more adonifhing, is the enormous (tones which compofe the (loping wall., To the wed the fecond layer is formed of dones which are from 28 to 35 feet by Solomon ; nor do they approach nearer probability when they attribute to that king the well of Tyre and the buildings of Palmyra. Thirdly, That the belief in hidden treafures has been confirmed by difcoveries which have been really made from tirrv e. It is not many years fince a fmall coffer wa>, fo at He¬ bron full of gold and filver medals, with an ancient Arabic book on medicine. In the country of the Druzes, an individual difeovered likewife, fome time fince, ajar with gold coin in the form of a crefcent; long, by about nine in height.

"When we confider the extraordinary magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be aftonilhed at the filence of the Greek and Roman authors. Mr Wood, who has carefully examined all the ancient wri¬ ters, has found no mention of it, except in a fragment of John of Antioch, who attributes the conftru&ioa of this edifice to Antoninus Pips. The inferiptions of explaining it, by fuppofing thefe edifices to have which remain corroborate this opinion, which perfedt- been conftnnSted by Djenoun, or genii, who obeyed 1 c —a-—- ~r- -r il-~ /~i-— the orders of King Solomon ; adding, that the motive -of fuch immenfe works was to conceal in fubterraneous caverns vaft treafures, which (till remain there. To difeover thefe, many have defeended into the vaults Vol. II. Part II, ly accounts for the conftant ufe of the Corinthian or¬ der, fince that order was not in general ufe before the third age of Rome ; but we ought by no means to al¬ lege as an additional proof the bird fculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and 5 D the B A L [76 Balbec the caduceus he bears, give him the appearance of an H eagle, the tuft of feathers on his head, like that of _ US’ .certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman eagle : ~ befides that the fame bird is found in the temple of Palmyra; and is therefore evidently an oriental eagle, confecrated to the fun, who was the divinity adored in both thefe temples. His worfhip exifted at Balbec in the moft remote antiquity. His ftatue, which rcfem- bled that of Ofiris, had been tranfported there from the Heliopolis of Egypt, and the ceremonies with which he was worlhipped there have been defcribed by Mac- robius, in his curious work intitled Saturnalia. Mr Wood fuppofes with reafon, that the name of Balbec, which in Syriac fignifies City of Bal, or of the fun, o- riginated in this worfhip. The Greeks, by naming it Heliopolis, have in this indance only given a literal tranflation of the oriental word; a pra&ice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the date of this city in remote antiquity ; but it is to be prefumed, that its fituation, on the road from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it fome part of the commerce of thefe opulent capitals. Under the Romans, in the time of Auguftus, it is mentioned as a garrifon-town; and there is ftill remaining, on the wall of the fouthern gate, on the right as we enter, an infcription which proves the truth of this, the words kenturia prima, in Greek charafters, being very legible. One hundred and forty years after, Antoninus built there the pre- fent temple, inftead of the ancient one, which was doubtlefs falling into ruins : but Chriftianity having gained the afcendency under Conftantine, the modern temple was negle&ed, and afterwards converted into a church ; a wall of which is now remaining, that hid the fanftuary of the idols. It continued thus until the invafion of the Arabs, when it is probable they envied the Chriftians fo beautiful a building. The church be¬ ing lefs frequented, fell to decay ; wars fucceeded ; and it was converted into a place of defence ; battlements were built on the wall which furrounded it, on the pa¬ vilions, and at the angles, which ftill fubfift; and from that time, the temple, expofed to the fate of war, fell rapidly to ruin. The ftate of the city is not lefs de¬ plorable. The wretched government of the emirs of the houfe of Harfoufhe had already greatly impaired it; and the earthquake of 1759 completed its de- ftruftion. The wars of the Emir Youfef and Djezzar have rendered it ftill more defected and ruinous. Of 5000 inhabitants, at which number they were eftima- ted in 1751, not 1200 are now remaining; and all thefe poor, without induftry or commerce, and culti¬ vating nothing but a little cotton, fome maize, and water-melons","Roman, Antioch, Rome, Roman, Tyre, Of","RO,US,GR,EG,LB,TR",3,"Romania,United States,Greece,Egypt,Lebanon,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa,Asia,Asia"

"Inftead of adminifteritig the ordinance by fprinkling ■v* or pouring water, they maintain that it ought to be adminiftered only by immerfion. Such, they infill, is the meaning of the word; fo that a command Baptifh. - to baptize is a command to immerfe. Thus it was underftood by thofe who firft adminiftered it. John the Baptift, and the apoftles of Chrift, adminiftered it in Jordan and other rivers, and places where there was much water. Both the adminiftrators and the fubjedls are defcribed as going down into, and coming up again out of, the water ; and the baptized are faid to be buried in baptifm, and to be railed again ; which lan¬ guage could not, they fay, be properly adopted on (uppofition of the ordinance being adminiftered in any other manner than by imrqis.rfion.

To fiich perfons, and to fuch only, baptifm appears to have been adminiftered by the apoftles, and the immediate dif- ciples of Chrift.
