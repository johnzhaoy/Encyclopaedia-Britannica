"It appears pretty certain from Dr Hawkefwqrth’s Account of die Voyages to the South Seas, that the in¬ habitants of the ifland of New Zealand, a country un- furnilhed with the necelfaries of life, eat the boflies of their enemies. It appears alfo to be very probable, that both the wars and anthropophagy of thefe favages take their rife and owe their continuance to irrefiftible neceffity, and the dreadful alterhative of deftroying each other by violence, or of perifliing by hunger, bee vol. iii. p. 447, & leq. and vol. ii. p. 389, &c",,NZ,3,New Zealand,Oceania

"Gen.) : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the petandria clafs of plants. The capfule is tri- locular 5 the ne<5tarium is pyramidal, pentagonous, and the length of the corolla. There is but one fpecies, the nitidum or glofly, a native of New Caledonia",,NC,3,New Caledonia,Oceania
"Though this tree has been mentioned by many voy¬ agers, particularly by Dampier, by Rumphius, and by Lord Anfon, yet very little notice feems to have been ta¬ ken of it till the return of Captain Wallis from the South Seas, and fince that time by others who have touched at Otaheite and fome countries in the Eaft Indies. Cap¬ tain Dampier relates, that in Guam, one of the La- drone iflands, “ there is a certain fruit called t\\e bread fruit, growing on a tree as big as our large apple-tree?, with dark leaves. The fruit is round, and grows on the boughs like apples, of the bignefs of a good pen¬ ny loaf : wdien ripe, it turns yellow, foft, and fweet j but the natives take it green, and bake it in an oven till the rind is black : this they fcrape off, and eat the infide, which is foft and white, like the infide of new- baked bread, having neither feed nor ftone ; but if it is kept above 24 hours it is harfh. As this fruit is in feafon eight months in the year, the.natives feed upon no other fort of bread during that time. They told us that all the Ladrone iflands had plenty of it. I ne¬ ver heard of it in any other place.” Rumphius, after deforibing the tree, obferves, that "" the fruit is fhaped like a heart, and increafos to the fize of a child’s head. Its furface or rind is thick, green, and covered every where with warts of a qua- dragonal or hexagonal figure, like cut diamonds, but without points. The more flat and fmooth thefe warts are, the fewer feeds are contained in the fruit, and the greater is the quantity of pith, and that of a more glutinous nature. The internal part of the rind, of peel, confifts of a flefhy fubftance, full of .twifted fibres, which have the appearance of fine wool j thefe adhere to, and in fome meafure form it. The fleftiy part of this fruit becomes fofter towards the middle, where there is a fmall cavity formed without any nuts or feeds, except in one fpecies, which has but a fmall number, and this fort is not good, unlefs it is baked or prepared fome other way : but if the outward rind be taken off, and the fibrous flefli dried and afterwards boiled with meat as we do cabbage, it has then the tafte of arti¬ choke bottoms. The inhabitants of Amboyna drefs it in the liquor of cocoa-nuts : but they prefer it roaft- ed on coals till the outward part or peel is burnt. They afterwards cut it into pieces, and eat it with the milk of the cocoa nut. Some people make fritters of it, or fry it in oil; and others, as the Sumatrians, dry the internal foft part, and keep it to ufe inftead of bread with other food. It affords a great deal of nourifti- ment, and is very fatisfying, therefore proper for hard¬ working people : and being of a gentle aftringent qua- lity, is good for perfons of a laxative habit of body",,GU,3,Guam,Oceania
"Cotemporary with Kep'er were Mr Edward Wright, and Napier baron of Merchifton. To the former we owe feveral very good meridional obfervations of the fun’g Hiftory. ASTRO fun’s altitude, made with a quadrant of fix feet radius, in the years 1594, 1595> and 1596; from which he greatly improved the theory of the fun’s motion, and computed more exact tables of his declination than had been done by any perfon before. He publiihed alfo, in I599> an excellent Treatife, intitled, “ Cer¬ tain Errors in Navigation difcovered and detefted.” To the latter we are indebted for the knowledge of logarithms; a'difcovery, as wasjuftly oblerved by Dr Halley, one of the moft. ufeful ever made in the art of numbering. John Bayer, a German, who lived about the fame time, will ever be memorable for his work, intitled, Uranometria, 'which is a very complete ce- leftial atlas, or a colle&ion of all the conftellations vifi- ble in Europe. To this he adde’d a nomenclature, in which the. ftars in each conftellation are marked with the letters of the Greek alphabet; and thus every ftar in the heavens may be referred to with the utmoft pre- cilion and exaftnefs. About the fame time alfo, agro¬ nomy was cultivated by many other perfons ; abroad, by Maginus, Mercator, Maurolycus, Homelius, Schul- tet, Stevin, &c.; and by Thomas and Leonard Digges, John Dee, and Robert Flood, in England : but none of them made any confiderable improvement","Wright, Napier","US,NZ,DE,GR",3,"United States,New Zealand,Germany,Greece","North America,Oceania,Europe,Europe"
