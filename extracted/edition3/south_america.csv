"ATLANTIS, Atalantis, or Atlantica, an- ifland mentioned by Plato and fome others of the an¬ cients, concerning the real exiftence of which many difputes have been raifed. Homer, Horace, and the other poets, make two Atlanticas, calling them He- fperidss and Elyftan Fields, making them the habita¬ tions of the blelfed. The mod diftinct account of this ifland we have in Plato’s Timreus, of which Mr Cham¬ bers gives the following abridgement. “ The Atlantis was a large ifland in the weftern ocean, fituated before or oppofite to the ftraits of Gades. Out of this ifland there was an eafy paflage into fome others, which lay near a large continent exceeding in bignefs all Europe and Afia. Neptune fettled in this ifland (from whofe fon Atlas its name was derived), and divided it among his ten fons. To the youngeft fell the extremity of the ifland, called Gadtr, which in the language of the country fignifies fertile, or abundant in Jkeep. The defcehdants of Neptune reigned here from father to Ton for a great number of generations in the order of primogeniture, during the fpace of 9000 years. They alfo poffefled feveral other iflands; and, palling into Europe and Africa, fubdued all Libya as far as Egypt, and all Europe to Afia Minor. At length the ifland funk under water ; and for a long time afterwards the fea thereabouts was full of rocks and /helves. ” Many of the moderns alfo are of opinion, that the exiilehce of the Atlantis is not to be looked upon as entirely fabulous. Some take it to have been Ameri¬ ca ; and from thence, as well as from a paflage in Se¬ neca’s Medea, and fome other obfcure hints, they imagine that the new world was not unknown to the ancients. But allowing this to be the cafe, the above- mentioned continent which wras faid to lie beyond At¬ lantis would feem rather to have been the continent of America than Atlantis itfelf.

"“ Another particular obfervable on all the high places of the Cordilleras, and which depends on the fame eaufe, is, that when we leave the flrade, and ex- pofe ourfelves to the funlhine, we feel a much greater difference than we do here in our fine days when the weather is temperate. Every thing contributes at Quito to make the fun exceedingly powerful: a Angle ftep from an expofed place to the fhade gives the fen- fation of cold: this would not be the cafe if the quan¬ tity of heat acquired by the foil were more confider- able. We now alfo fee why the fame thermometer, put’firft into the lhade and then in the fun, does not undergo the fame changes at all times and in all pla¬ ces. In the morning, upon Pichincha, this inftrument is generally a few degrees below the freezing point* which may be reckoned the natural temperature of the place; but when during the day we expofe it to the fun, it is eafy to imagine that the effeft muft be great* and much more than double in whatever way it is mea- fured.” This theory is adopted by Mr Sauffure, who adds the following faft to prove that the aftion of the fun’s rays, cpnfidered abftraftedly and independent of any_ l9 ] extrinfic fource of cold, is as great on mountains as on £iafl-es g. ] plains; viz. that the power of burning lenfes and mir- qually rors is the fame at all heights. To afeertain this faft, powerful our author procured a burning-glafs fo weak that at “j? Geneva it would juft fet fire to tinder. This he car- ta;ns as oa , ried, with feme of the fame tinder, to the top of the plains, mountain Saleve (a height of 3000 feet) ; where it not only produced the fame effeft, but apparently with greater facility than on the plain. Being perfuaded then, that the principal fource of cold on the tops of high mountains is their being perpetually furrounded with an atmofphere which cannot be much heated ei¬ ther by the rays of the fun on account of its tranfpa¬ rency, or by the refleftion of them from the earth by reafon of its diftance, he wilhed to know, whether the direft folar rays on the top of a high mountain had the fame power as on the plain, while the body on which they afted was placed in fuch a manner as to be unaf- fefted by the furrounding air. For this purpofe he inflituted a fet of experiments, from which he drew the following conclufions, viz. that a difference of 777 toifes in height, diminilhes the heat which the rays of the fun are able to communicate to a body expofed to the ex¬ ternal air, 140 of the thermometer; that it diminiihes the heat of a body partially expofed, only 6°; and that it augments by 10 the heat of a third body completely defended from the air. 2e Hence it appears that the atmofphere, though fo Atmo- effentially neceffary to the fuppoi t of fire, is fome how ft-here eve- or other the greateft antagonift of heat, and moft ef- feftually counterafts the operation of. the folar rays in^e heat of producing it.

That warm air ffiould always afcend ; and thus, when the fource of heat is taken away by the abfence of the fun, that the ftratum of atmofphere lying immediately next to the earth (hould be fomewhat colder than that which lies a little farther up; is not at all to be wondered at. We have an example fomewhat fimilar to this in the pot¬ ter’s kiln ; where, after the veffels have been intenfely heated for feme time, and the fire is then withdrawn, the cooling always begins at bottom, and thofe which Hand lowermoft will often be quite black, while all the upper part of the furnace and the veffels next to it are of a bright red. It doth not, however, appear why fuch degrees of cold ffiould take place at the furface of the earth as we fometimes meet with.
