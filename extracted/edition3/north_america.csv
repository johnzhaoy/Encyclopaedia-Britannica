Hence, the full expanfion of the human body, or when it was capable of generating, muft have required 120 or 130 years; and the duration of life would be in proportion to the time of growth, as is uniformly the cafe at prefent: For if we fuppofe the age of puberty, among the firft races of men, to have been 130 years, as they now ar¬ rive at that age in 14 years, the age of the Antedilu¬ vians will be in exaft proportion to that of the prefent race; fince by multiplying thefe two numbers by feven, for example, the age of the prefent race will be 90, and that of the Antediluvians vyill be 910.

"ever, this work of Adrian’s did not long continue to the extreme boundary of the Roman territories to the north in Britain. For Antoninus Pius, the adopted fon and immediate fucceffor of Adrian, having, by his lieutenant Lollius Urbicus, recovered the country once conquered by Agricola, commanded another rampart to be ereifted between the friths of Forth and Clyde, in the trad! where Agricola had formerly built his chain of forts. The great number of inferiptions which have been found in or near the ruins of this wall, or rampart, to the honour of Antoninus Pius, leave us no room to doubt its having been built by his direftion and com¬ mand. If the fragment of a Roman pillar with an in¬ feription, now in the college library of Edinburgh, be¬ longed to this work, as it is generally fuppofed to have done, it fixes the date of its execution to the third confulfhip of Antoninus, which was A. D. 140, only 20 years after that of Adrian, of which this feems to have been an imitation. This wall or rampart, as feme imagine, reached from Caer-ridden on the frith of Forth to Old Kirkpatrick on the Clyde ; or, as o- thers think, from Kinniel on the eaft to Dunglafs on the weft. Thefe difterent fuppofitions hardly make a mile of difference in the length of this work, which, from feveral adhial menfurations, appears to have been 37 Englifli or 40 Roman miles. Capitolinus, in his life of Antoninus Pius, diredlly affirms, that the wall which that emperor built in Britain was of turf. This in the main is unqueftionably true ; though it is evident (from the veftiges of it ftill remaining, which not very many years ago were dug up and examined for near a mile together) that the foundation was of ftone. Mr Cam¬ den alfo tells us, from the papers of one Mr Anthony Pont, that the principal rampart was faced with fquare ftone, to prevent the earth from falling into the ditch","Adrian, Roman, Adrian, Roman, Edinburgh, Adrian, Roman","US,RO,GB",3,"United States,Romania,United Kingdom","North America,Europe,Europe"
"The chief parts of this work were as follows : 1. A broad and deep ditch, whofe dimenfions cannot now be difeovered with certainty and exaftnefs, tho’ Mr Pont fays it was 12 feet wide. 2. The principal wall or rampart was about 12 feet thick at the foundation, but its original height cannot nowbe determined. This wall was fituated on the fouth brink of the ditch. 3. A military way on the fouth fide of the principal wall, well paved, and railed a little above the level of the ground.

The number of thefe forts or ftations, whofe veftiges were vifible in Mr Font’s time, were 1 8, fituated at about the diitance of two miles from each other. In the intervals between the forts, there were turrets or watch-towers.

"Whether Apollo was ever a real perfonage, or only the great luminary, many have doubted. Indeed, Vof- iius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a metaphorical being, and that there never was any o- ther Apollo than the fun. “ He was ftyled the fon of Jupiter (fays this author), becaufe that god was rec¬ koned by the ancients the author of the world. His mother was called Latona, a name which fignifies hid¬ den ; becaufe, before the fun was created, all things were wrapped up in the obfcurity of chaos. He is always reprefented as beardlefs and youthful, becaufe the fun never grows old or decays. And what elfe can his bow and arrows imply, but his piercing beams ?” And adds, “ that all the ceremonies which were performed to his honour, had a manifeft relation to the great fource of light which he reprefented. Whence (he concludes) it is vain to feek for any other divinity than the fun, which was adored under the name of Apdlfe.'” However, though this be in general trye, yet it does appear, from many paffages in ancient authors, that there was fome illuftrious perfonage named 4polle,who, after his apotheofis, was taken for the fun; as Ofiris and Orus in Egypt, whofe exiftence cannot be called in <jueftion, were, after their death, confounded with the fun, of which they became the fymbols, either from the glory and fplendor of their reigns, or from a belief that their fouls had taken up their refidence in that luminary",Jupiter,"EG,US",3,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

"It is eafy to trace almoft all the Grecian fables and mythologies from Egypt.

If the Greek Apollo was reckoned the god of eloquence, mu- fic, medicine, and poetry, the reafon was, that Oliris, who was the fymbol of the fun among the Egyptians, as well as his fon Orus, had there taught thofe liberal arts. If the Greek Apollo was the god and conduc¬ tor of the mufes, it was becaufe Ofiris carried with him in his expedition to the Indies finging women and mu- ficians.

"Aqusedudts of every kind were long ago the wonders of Rome ; the vaft quantity of them which they had ; the prodigious expence employed in conducing Waters over arcades from one place to another, at the diftance of 30, 40, 60, and even 100 miles, which were either continued or fupplied by other labours, as by cutting mountains and piercing rocks; all this ought to fur- prife us ; nothing like this is undertaken in our times: we dare not even think of purchafing public conveni- ency at fo dear a rate. Appias the cenfor advifed and conftrudted the firft aquasduift. His example gave the public luxury a hint to cultivate thefe obje&s ; and the force of prodigious and indefatigable labour diverted the courfe of rivers and floods to Rome. Agrippa, in that year when he was aedtle, put the laft hand to the magnificence of thefe works. It is chiefly in this re- fpedt that the modern fo much refembles the ancient city of Rome. For this advantage, ftie is peculiarly indebted to Sextus V. and to Paul V. who for gran¬ deur and magnificence emulated the mafters of the uni- verfe *. There are ftill to be feen, in different places* See Net*- contiguous to Rome, ftriking remains of thefe aquse- Memoirs dudts; arches continued thro’ a long fpace, over which °f were extended the canals which carried the water tovol*_u the city. The arches are fometimes low, fometimes raifed t® a vaft height, to humour the tumidities or de* preffions of the ground. There are fome which have two arcades, one conftrudted above the other; and this precaution was obferved, left the height of a Angle ar¬ cade, if extended as far as the fituation required, might render the ftrudture lefs firm and permanent.

Thefe carried the waters to fuch aquse¬ dufts as were raifed above ground, in the declivity or at the foot of mountains.

"There is one thing, however, which deferves to be remarked. It is, that thefe aqusedufts, which might have been direfted in a ftraight line to the city, did not arrive at it but by frequent and winding mazes. Some have faid that this oblique traft was purfued to avoid the expence which muft attend the building of arcades to an extraordinary height: others, that it was their intention to diminilh the impetuofity of the current which* A Q_ U [ 145 ] A (l tJ which, rolling in a ftraight line through an immenfe v—-/ fpace,muft always have increafed its velocity,muft have worn the canals by perpetual and forcible attrition, and of confequence afforded an impure and unwhole- fome draught to the inhabitants.

It is replied, the motive of obtaining the water more falubrious, and more limpid, was fufficient to make the Romans think their labour neceffary, and their expence properly beftowed; and to thofe who re- fleed that the waters of this river were impregnated with mineral particles, and by no means wholefome, the an- fwer will appear fatisfadtory","Tivoli, Rome","IT,US",3,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"

"On Mahomet’s arrival at Mecca, his firft care was to build a mofque for his religious worfhip, and an houfe for himfelf. The city of Medina at that time was inha¬ bited partly by Jews and partly by heretical Chriftians, that formed two fa&ions which perlecuted one another with great violence. This gave the impoftor fuch an opportunity of propagating his new religion, that in a fhort time the city was entirely at his devotion.

The grand ftandard was carried before the prophet by Mofaab Ebn Omair. With thefe forces Mahomet formed a camp in a village near Ohod, a mountain about four miles north of Medina, which he contrived to have on his back ; and the better to fecure his men from being furrounded, he placed 50 archers, the flower of his troops, in the rear, with ftridt orders not to quit their port.

"The next year, (A. D. 626.), Mahomet, befides fe! veral other lefs confiderable fuccefles, reduced a fortrefs belonging to the Jewiih tribe of A1 Nadir, who had revolted on account of the defeat at Ohod: on tins occafion, by an exprefs revelation, as he pretended, he kept the whole booty to himfelf; and, about the fame time, forbad his followers the ufe of wine, or to play at games of chance, on account of the difturbances and quarrels A R A [ 158 3 A R A Arabia, quarrels which were likely to be excited by that means among them. This year alio he marched with a body of infantry to Bedr, to meet Abu Sofian, as he had promifed the year before : but that general's heart fail¬ ing him, he returned home without facing the prophet; and this piece of cowardice the Moflems did not fail to J2 impute to a terror fent immediately from God. The Siege of year following, however, the Koreifh, in conjundlion Medina, with the tribe of Ghatfan, and the Jews of A1 Nadir and Koreidha, alfembled an army of 12,000 men, with which they formed the fiege of Medina; thusthreaten- ing the impoftor and all his followers with utter de- ftru&ion at once. On the enemy’s approach, Maho¬ met, by the advice of a Perfian named Salman, or¬ dered a deep ditch to be dug round the city, and went out to defend it with 3000 men. The Arabs having inverted the town, both fictes remained tn a rtate of in- a&ivity for fome time; which was fo well employed by the impoftor, that he found means to corrupt fome of the leading men in the enemy’s camp. The good elfe&s of this foon appeared ; for a champion having advan¬ ced to the Mortem entrenchments, and challenged the bell man in .their army to fight him in fmgle combat, the challenge was immediately accepted by Ali, who :flew him and another that came to his alllftance; after which, thole who had been corrupted by Mahomet’s agents fo Toured a confiderable part of the forces, that they deferted their.xamp; upon which all the reft were obliged to raife the fiege and return home","Medina, Medina",US,3,United States,North America
"This was done by communicating fome poifon to a fhoulder of mutton, of which one of his companions na¬ med Bajbar Ebn Al Bara, eating heartily, died upon the fpot; and Mahomet himfelf, though he recovered a little, and lived three years after, yet never enjoyed perfect health. Notwithftanding this misfortune, how¬ ever, he ft ill continued his enterprizes. The year 630 proved remarkably fortunate. It was ufhered in by the converfion of Khalid Ebn Al Walid, Amru Ebn Al As, and Otbman Ebn Telha, three of the moft conftderable perfons among the Koreifti; and this foon enabled him to become mailer of the whole peninfula 5g of Arabia.

"■ The death of Mahomet occafioned fuch a confterna* tion in Mecca, that the governor hid himfelf, fearing to be called to an account for his former conduft; and the inhabitants, upon the firft arrival of this melancholy news, confidered themfelves as deftitute of all manner of protection. After the firft impreftions of their fear, however, wrere over, they began to meditate a revolt; but were prevented by one Sohail Ebn Amru, a prin¬ cipal man of the Koreifti. The tumults at Medina, how¬ ever, were not fo eafily appeafed. The news of this fad event was no fooner publifhed there, than a number of people aflembled before his door, crying out, “ How can our apoftle be dead? Our interceffor, our medi¬ ator, has not entirely left us ! He is taken up into hea¬ ven, as was Ifa(Jefus); therefore he fhall not be buried.’, This was confirmed by Omar; who drew his fword,and fwore, that if any perfon affirmed Mahomet to be dead, he would cut off his hands and his feet. “ The Apo¬ ftle of God (fays he) is not dead : he is only gone for a feafon, as Mofes the fon of Amram was gone from the people of Ifrael for forty days, and then returned to them again.” The populace therefore kept the body above ground, even after the belly began to fwell; nor could the prophet’s uncle A1 Abbas, notwithftand- ing this, convince them to the contrary. Upon hear¬ ing of thefe tranfaCtions, Abu Beer immediately polled from A1 Sonah, another quarter of the city, and ex- poftulated with them in the following manner : “ Do you worfhip Mahomet, or the god of Mahomet ? If the latter, he is immortal, and liveth for ever ; but if the former, you are in a manifell error, for he is cer¬ tainly dead.” The truth of this affertion he imme¬ diately evinced from fevaral paffages of the Koran, in fo clear and conclufive a manner, that he not only fatis- fied Omar, but calmed the minds of all the people","Mecca, Medina","SA,US",3,"Saudi Arabia,United States","Asia,North America"

"Soon after Abu Beer’s acceffion, many of the Arabs refufed to pay the tribute impofed upon them by Ma¬ homet, and even attempted to fhake off his yoke alto¬ gether. This fo alarmed the khalif and his fubjeCts at Medina, that, fearing a general revolt, they fent all not able to bear arms into the cavities of the rocks and mountains, and put themfelves in as good a pofture of defence as the ftiort time would permit.

"Before the departure of the army under his command, Abu Beer had come to a refolution to invade Syria ; and finding his defign approved by the principal offi¬ cers of his court, he fent circular letters to the petty princes of Yaman, the chief men of Mecca, &c. in¬ forming them of his intention to take Syria out of the hands of the infidels ; acquainting them, at the fame time, that a war for the propagation of the true reli¬ gion was an aft of obedience to God. To thefe letters they paid a proper regard ; and in a very fhort time appeared at Medina at the head of their refpeftive troops, and pitched their tents round the city. Here they ftaid till the Moflem army deftined to aft againft the emperor was completely formed, and in a capacity to begin its march. The khalif having viewed the troops from the top of an hill, and prayed to God for fuccefs, attended the generals a little way on foot. As the generals were on horfeback, they could not forbear exprefling their uneaiinefs at the khaliff’s thus demean¬ ing himfelf; but he told them, that it fignified little whether they walked on foot or rode, as they had all sthe fame views, viz. the fervice of God, and the pro¬ pagation of religion.

"Immediately after Youkinna had fhut himfelf Tip in ’ the caftle, a council of war was held in the Moflem camp, wherein it wras deliberated what mealures were to be purfued on. the prefent occafion. Khaled gave it as }iis opinion, that the caftle ought immediately to be attacked with all the Arab forces, before the emperor had time to fend them any afli.ftance. This advice was followed by AbtxObeidahj who caufed the citadel to noeuvre he likewife hoped that Ycukinna would be L upon his guard. Herein, however, he found him¬ felf miftaken: for the Greek commander, by the pru¬ dent meafures he took, eluded all furprize ; and tho’ Abu Obeidah continued the fiege for four months al¬ ter the laft-mentioned blow given to the garrifon by Khaled, yet he had fcarce any hopes of making himfelf mafter of it at laft. Having nothing material to write to the khalif, he remained a long time filent; at which Omar being very much concerned, wrote to him, dell¬ ring an account of the affairs in Syria. Abu Obeidah acquainted him that the city of Aleppo had fubmitted to him ; and that the citadel was the only place which held out in all that country, before which he had loft a great number of men, which, he faid, had induced him to think of railing the fiege, and moving with his ar¬ my m that track which lay between Antioch and A- leppo. This news was by no means, agreeable to the khalif, who commanded his general to continue the fiege at all events, and fent him a reinforcement of Arab troops, together with 70 camels, to aflift the infantry in their march. g$ Among the troops fent by Omar on this occafion,Thecnade! there was an Arab of a gigantic fize, called ZWicj. taken bx whoftrata£em* A R A [ 165 ] A R A Arabia, who •was a man of great courage and refolution. He «k»—y . 0bferving tbe little progrefs made by the Moilems, be¬ thought himfelf of a ftratagem by which that fortrefs might be reduced, which leemed fo difficult to be ac- complifhed by force. He therefore deiired that Abu Obeidah would affign him the command of a party con- fifling only of thirty men; which at Khaled’s requeft was readily granted. Then he begged the general to raife the fiege, and retire to about three miles difiance from the cafile, which was like wife immediately com¬ plied with. The following night Dames, who had ported himfelf with his party very near the citadel, found means to feize a Greek, from whom he learned Ithat Youkinna, after the fiege was raifed, had exadted large fums of money from the citizens, on account of the treaty they had concluded with the Arabs and that he was one of thofe who had endeavoured to make their efcape from the opprefiion of fuch a tyrant, by leaping down from the wall. This man Dames took under his protection; but beheaded five or fix others who fell into his hands, and could give no good account of ' % , themfelves. He then covered his head and fhoulders with a goat’s fiun, and took a dry cruft in his hand, creeping on the ground till he got clofe to the foot of the wall. If he heard any noife, or fufpedted any perfon to be near, he made fuch a noife with his cruft as a dog does when he is gnawing a bone ; his compa¬ nions fometimes walking, and fometimes creeping after him in the fame manner. He had before difpatched two of his men to Abu Obeidah, to defire that a de¬ tachment of horfe might be fent him by break of day to fupport his fmall party, and facilitate the execution of the plan he had formed. At laft Dames found an opportunity of raifing fcven men upon his fhoul¬ ders, who flood one upon another’s fhoulders in fuch a manner that the higheft reached the top of the wall. Here he foon placed himfelf, feized a watch¬ man whom he found afleep, and threw him over the wall. Two others, whom he found in the fame condi¬ tion, he ftabbed with his dagger, and threw them over likewife. Then he laid down his turban, and drew up the fecond of his brethren, as they two did the third, and by their help Dames himfelf and all the reft were enabled to mount the wall. He then private¬ ly ftabbed the centry at each of the gates, and put his men in pofleffion of every one of them.

"After the reduction of the citadel of Aleppo, Abui Obeidah intended to march to Antioch ; but was di¬ verted by Youkinna, who was now become a violent enemy to the Chriftians. He told the Moftem gene¬ ral, that his conqueft of that part of the country would not be complete without the reduftion of Azaz, a_ place of great importance, where Theodoras, Ycukin- Arabia, na’s coufin-german, was commandant. This forlrefs Jie propofed to become mafter of, by putting himfelf at the head of too Arab horfe drelfed in the Greek habit, who were to attend him to Azaz. Upon his arrival there, he was to affure Theodorus that he was Hill in reality a Chriftian, and had taken that opportunity to . efcape from the Mortem camp. But, to make his fto- ry more probable, Abu Obeidah was to fend after him a detachment of 1000 horfe, who were to purfue him as far as Morah, a village in the neighbourhood of Azaz, with orders to poft themfelves there; from whence, if fuch a meafure ftiould be found neceflary, they might eafily advance to Azaz, to facilitate the conqueft of that place. To this fcheme Abu Obeidah agreed; but Youkinna with all his men were immedi¬ ately taken prifoners by Theodorus, who had been in¬ formed of the whole affair by a ipy in the Mcflem camp, who had fent him a letter by a pigeon.

The challenge was accepted by a young Arab officer of Yaman ; who being ani¬ mated by a notion, derived from the prophet himfelf, fupply of arms and provifions for Conftantine’s army, he was admitted into the town, and received with great kindnefs. Here, however, he had not been long before he was difeovered by one of his own foldiers, and put under arreft, with 900 of his men.

About the fame time alfo, Abul Abar, who had been conftituted admiral by Moawiyah, gave the emperor Conftans a fignal defeat by fea, on the coaft of Lycia, in which fuch a number of Chri- ftians were killed, that the neighbouring fea was dyed with their blood. r02 ] But while Othman was thus carrying every thing ir-Infurrefti- ] refiftibly before him abroad, he negleCted to fecureons agai,n® J the affeClions of his fubjeCts at home, which foon pro-the khalit’ | ved his ruin. Sedition was induftrioufly propagated through all the provinces of the empire, and articles of accufation brought againft the khalif. The chief of thefe were, That he had recalled one who had beenba- niflied by the prophet; that he had removed Saad, an officer of diftinguifhed bravery, and fuppKed his place by one who drank wine, and was otherwife of a fcan- dalous life ; that he had fquandered away vaft fums a- mong his favourites ; that he had removed Amru from the government of Egypt, to which he had preferred his own fofter-brother; and, laftly, that he had pre¬ fumed to fit on the top of Mahomet’s pulpit, whereas Abu Beer had always fat on the higheft ftep and Omar on the loweft. To this formidable. accufation the poor khalif pleaded guilty, and promifed to make all the re¬ paration in his power; but his condefcenfion only fer- ved to increafe the infolence of the rebels. They were however appeafed by Ali; and public tranquillity had undoubtedly been reftored, had it not been for Ayeiha, one of Mahomet’s widows, who procured the deftruc- tion of the khalif by a fcheme truly worthy of the wife of fuch an hufband. That traitrefs, being defirous of raifing one of her favourites named Telha to the digni¬ ty of khalif, prevailed on Merwan the fecretary of ftate to write a letter to the prefect of Egypt, enjoining him to put to death Mahomet Ebn Abu Beer, with whom it was fent, and who was to be his fucceflbr. This letter Merwan took care ffiould be difeovered : and Ma¬ homet taking it for a genuine order of the khalif, pu- bliftied the fuppofed injury all over the neighbouring countries. He then marched with a body of rebels to Medina, where the innocent khalif was befieged in his palace ; and, notwithftanding all his proteftations, no¬ thing lefs titan his death could fatisfy the enraged mul¬ titude. In this deplorable fituation Othman fent to Ali for affiftance ; who commanded his two fons Hafan and Hofein to defend the palace-gates. This they did for fome time with fidelity enough, till finding the khalif reduced to great ftraits for want of water, they abandoned their polls; upon which the rebels eafily made themfelves mailers of the palace, and cruelly 103 murdered the khalif, in the 8 2d year of his age, after He is mw- he had reigned 12 years.

"The empire of Alexander the Great, which arofe with (fill more rapidity than that of the Arabs, had no fup- port but from his own ambition and perfonal qualifi¬ cations. While he lived, he was without a rival, be- oaufe all were afraid of him; but when he died, the bands of union, whereby his empire had been held to¬ gether, were immediately diifolved. His captains were not infpired with the fame veneration for his fon, who was unborn at the time of his death, that they had for his father ; and therefore they fought not to conquer for him, but for themfelves ; and the confequence was, that the kingdom fell* to pieces the moment that he died. The fame thing happened to the empires of Jenghiz Khan, Tamerlane, and others, who made vaft cpnquefts in a fhort time. They eredled mighty em¬ pires indeed; but their duration, we may fay, was but momentary.

"This was the ftyle of building praCtifed all over Eu¬ rope ; and it continued to be ufed by the Normans, after their arrival here, till the introduction of wffiat is called the modern Gothic, which was not till about the end of the reign of Henry II. fo that there feems to be little or no grounds for a diftinCtion between the Saxon and Norman architecture. Indeed it is faid, the buildings of the latter were of larger dimenfions both in height and area; and they were conftruCted with a ftone brought from Caen in Normandy, of which their workmen were peculiarly fond: but this was Amply an alteration in the fcale and materials, and not in the manner of the building. The ancient parts of moft of our cathedrals are of this'early Norman work.—The charaCteriftic marks of this ftyle are thefe : The wndls are very thick, generally without buttreffes; the arches, both within and without, as well as thofe over the doors and windows, femicircular, and fupported by very 222 A R C H I T very folld, or rather clumfy, columns, with a kind of regular bafe and capital: in iliort, plainnefs and foil* dit'y coniiitute the itriking features of this method of building.

"edifices of the Arabians (we may include the other o- rientals) as extraordinary as their thoughts. If any one doubts of this affertion, let us appeal to’ any one who has feen the.mofques and palaces of Fez, or .fome of the cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors : one model of this fort is the church at Burgos; and even in this ifland there are not wanting feveral examples of the fame ; fuch buildings have been vulgarly called modern Gothic, but their true appellation is Arabic, Saracenic, or Morefque.*--This manner was introduced E c T tl R E. Hiftorjf into Europe thro’ Spain. Learning ffouriftied: among the Arabians all the time that their dominion was in full power; they ftudied philofophy, mathematics, phyfic and poetry. The love of learning was at once excited; in all places that wer^, not at too great a diftance from Spain, thefe authors were read; and fuch of the Greek authors as they had tranflated into | Arabic, were from thence turned into Latin. The phyfic and philofophy of the Arabians fpread themfelves in Europe, and with thefe their architeClure: many churches were built after the Saracenic mode ; and o- thers with a mixture of heavy and light proportions, the alteration that the difference of the climate might require, was little, if at all confidered. In moft fou- thern parts of Europe, and in Africa, the windows (before the ufe of glafs), made with narrow apertures, and placed very high in the walls of the building, occa- fioned a fliade and darknefs within fide, and were all i contrived to guard againft the fierce rays of the fun ; yet were ill fuited to latitudes, where that glorious lu* minary fliades its feebler influences, and is rarely feen but through a watery cloud.” Mr Grofe, however, thinks the above opinion is notfuf- ficiently favoured by the obfervations of feveral learned travellers -who have accurately furveyed the ancient mode of building in thofe parts of the world. Thus Cornelius le Brun, an indefatigable and inquifitive tra¬ veller, has publifhed many views of eaftern buildings, particularly about the Holy Land: in all thefe, only one Gothic ruin, the church near Acre, and a few pointed arches occur; and thofe built by the Chri- ftians when in poffeffion of the country. Near Ifpa- han, in Perfia, he gives feveral buildings wuth pointed arches : but thefe are bridges and caravanferas, whofe age cannot be afcertained ; confequently are as likely to have been built after,as before the introduction of this ftyle into Europe. At Ifpahan itfelf, the mey doen, or grand, market-place, is furrounded by divers magnificent Gothic buildings ; particularly the royal ■ mofque, and the Talael Ali-kapie, or theatre.

"This, by way of diftinction, I would call the Saxon architeaure. But our Norman works had a very dif¬ ferent original. When^ the Goths had conquered Spain, and the genial warmth of the climate and the religion of the old inhabitants had ripened their wits and inflamed their miftaken piety, both kept in exer- - cife by the neighbourhood of the Saracens, through e- mulation of their fervice, and averfion to their fuper- ftition, they ftruck out a new ipecies of architeaure, unknown to Greece and Rome, upon original princi¬ ples, and ideas much nobler than what had given birth even to claflical magnificence. For this northern peo¬ ple having been accuftomed, during the gloom of pa- ganifm, to worfhip the deity in groves (a praaioe common to all nations); when their new religion re¬ quired covered edifices, they ingenioufly projeaed to make them refemble groves, as nearly as the diftance of architeaure would permit; at once indulging their old prejudices, and providing for their prefent conve¬ niences","Norman, Rome","US,ES,GR",3,"United States,Spain,Greece","North America,Europe,Europe"
"When Julius Caefar invaded Britain, the inhabitants of Cantium (Kent), and of fome other parts in the fouth, had learned to build houfes a little more fub- ftantial and convenient. “ The country (fays Caefar) abounds in houfes which very much referable thofe of Gaul.” The firft ftep towards this improvement feems to have been that of daubing the wattled walls of their houfes wfith clay to fill up the chinks and make them warmer. “ The Germans ufed for this purpofe a kind of pure refplendent earth of different colours, which had an appearance of painting at a diftance;” but the Gauls and Britains chofe rather to whitewafh the clay after it was dry with chalk. Inftead of the boughs of trees, they thatched thefe houfes with ftraw, as a much better fecurity againft the weather. They next pro¬ ceeded to form the walls of Jarge beams of wood, in¬ ftead offtakes and wattles. This feems to have been the mode of building in Britain, when it was firft in¬ vaded by the Romans. “ The Britons (fays Diodorus Siculus, who w'as cotemporary with Caefar) dwell in wretched cottages, which are conftrufled of wood, co¬ vered with ftraw.” Thefe wooden houfes of the ancient Gauls and Britons were not fquare but circular, with high tapering roofs, at the top or centre of which was an aperture for the admiffion of light and emiflion of fmoke. Thofe of Gaul are thus defcribed by Strabo : “ They build their houfes of wood, in the form of a circle, with lofty tapering roofs.” The foundations of fome of the moft magnificent of thefe circular houfes were of ftone, of which there are fome veftiges ftill re¬ maining in Anglefey and other places.

"This was one of the arts which Agricola, the moft ex¬ cellent of the Roman governors, employed to civilize the Britons, and reconcile them to the Roman govern¬ ment. “ The following winter (fays Tacitus) was fpent by Agricola in very falutary meafures. That the Britons who led a roaming and unfettled life, and were eafily inftigated to war, might contract a love to peace and tranquillity, by being accuftomed to a more pleafant way of living, he exhorted and aflifted them to build houfes, temples, courts, and market¬ places. By praifmg the diligent and reproaching the indolent, he excited fo great an emulation among the Britons, that after they had ereCted all thofe neceffary edifices in their towns, they proceeded to build others merely for ornament and pleafure, as porticoes, galle¬ ries, baths, banqueting-houfes, &c.” From this time, which was A. D. 80, to the middle of the fourth cen¬ tury, architecture and all the arts immediately connect¬ ed with it greatly flourilhed in this ifland; and the fame tafte for ereCting folid, convenient, and beautiful buildings, which had long prevailed in Italy, was in¬ troduced into Britain. Every Roman colony and free city (of which there was a great number in this coun¬ try) was a little Rome, encompaffed with ftrong walls, adorned with temples, palaces, courts, halls, bafililks, baths, markets, aqueduCts, and many other fine build¬ ings, both for ufe and ornament. The country every where abounded with well-built villages, towns, forts, and ftations ; and the whole was defended by that high and ftrong wall, with its many towers and caftles, which reached from the mouth of the river Tine on the eaft to the Solway Firth on the weft. This fpirit of building,, which was introduced and encouraged by the Romans, fo much improved the tafte and increafed the number of the Britifli builders, that in the third ■ century this ifland was famous for the great number ' and excellence of. its architects and artificers.

"The truth is, that the Anglo-Saxons at their arrival in this illand were almoft totally ignorant of thefe arts ; fand, like all the other nations of Germany, had been accuftomed to live in wretched hovels, built of wood ,or earth, and covered with ftraw or the branches of trees : nor did they much improve in the knowledge ?of architedlure for 200 years after their arrival. Du¬ ring that period, mafonry was quite unknown and un- praftifed in this ifland ; and the walls even of cathe¬ dral churches were built of wood. “ There was a time (fays Venerable Bede) when there was ,not a ftone church in all the land ; but the cuftom was to build ..them all of wood. Finan, the fecond bifhop of Lin- disfarne, or Holy Illand, built a church in that ifland, A. D. 65.2, for a- cathedral, which yet was not of ftone, but of wood, and covered with reeds; and fo it continued till Eadhert, the fucceflbr of St Cuthbert, and feventh bifliop of Lindisfarne, took away the reeds, and covered it all over, both roofand walls, with Iheets of lead.” The firft cathedral of York was built of the Fame materials ; and a church of ftone was efteemed a kind of prodigy in thofe times that merited a place in hiftory. “ Paulinus, the firft biftiop of York, built a .church of ftone in the city of Lincoln, whofe walls (fays Bede) are ftill Handing, though the roof is fallen down; and fome healing miracles are wrought in it ; every year, for the benefit of thofe who have the faith to feek them.-” There does not feem to have been fo much as one church of ftone, nor any artifts who could build one, in all Scotland, at the beginning of the eighth centu¬ ry.

The cathedral of Hexham, which was one of thefe ftructures, is thus defcribed by his biographer: ftts “ Having obtained a piece of ground at Hexham from If i 1ft Queen Etheldreda, he there founded a moft magnifi- c. a*, cent church, which he dedicated to the bleffed apoftle St Andrew.

How magnificent the fuperftrudture, with its lofty roof, fupported by many pillars, its long and high walls, its fublime towers, and winding flairs ! In one word, there is no church on this fide of the Alps fo great and beautiful.” This admired edifice, of which fome <veftiges are ftill remaining, was built by mafons and other artificers brought from Rome by the munificence of its generous founder.

"‘0meric Vi- “ The new cathedrals and innumerable churches drat tal. Hiji were built in all parts, together with the many mag* ^ccJaa nificent cloifters and monafteries, and other apartments ' ' of monks, that were then ereCted, afford a fufficient proof of .the great felicity of England in the reign of Henry 1. The religious of every order, enjoying peace and profperity, difplayed the moft aftonilhing ardour in every thing that might increafe the fplendor of divine worftiip. The fervent zeal of die faithful prompted them to pull down houfes and churches every where, and rebuild them in a better manner. By this •means the ancient edifices that had been raifed in the -d ays of Edgar, Edward, and other Chriflian kings, were demolimed, and others .of greater magnitude and magnificence, and of more elegant workmanftiip, were erected in their room, to the glory of God.” As the prodigious power of religious zeal, what¬ ever turn it happens to take, when it is thoroughly heated, Is well known, it may not be improper to give -one example of the arts employed by the clergy and monks of this period, to inflame the pious ardour of the kings, nobles, and people, for building and adorn¬ ing churches. When Joffred Abbot of Croyland re- iblved to rebuild the church of his monaftery in a moft magnificent manner, A.

"rich and poor, in all Chriftian kingdoms. To make the beft ufe of this bull, he fent two of his moft eloquent monks to proclaim it over all France and Flanders, two other monks into Scotland, two into Denmark and Nor¬ way, two into Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and others into different parts of England. “ By this means (fays the hiftorian) the wonderful benefits granted to all the contributors to the building of this church were pub- lilhed to the very ends of the earth; and great heaps of treafure and maffes of yellow metal flowed in from all countries upon the venerable Abbot Joffred, and encouraged him to lay tire foundations of his church.” Having fpent about four years in colleding mountains of different kinds of marble from quarries both at home and abroad, together with great quantities of lime, iron, brafs, and other materials for building, he fixed a day for the great ceremony of laying the foun¬ dation, which he contrived to make a very effectual mean of raifing the fuperftru&ure : For on the long- expe&ed day, the feaft of the Holy Virgins Felicitas and Perpetua, an immenfe multitude of earls, barons, and knights, with their ladies and families, of abbots, priors, monks, nuns, clerks, and perfons of all ranks, arrived at Croyland, to aflift at this ceremony. The pious Abbot Joffred began by faying certain prayers, and fhedding a flood of tears on the foundation. Then each of the earls, barons, knights, with their ladies, fons, and daughters, the abbots, clerks, and others, laid a ftone, and upon it depofited a fum of money, a rant of lands, tithes, or patronages, or a promife of one, lime, wood, labour, or carriages, for building the church. After this the Abbot entertained the v/hole company, amounting to jooo perfons, at din¬ ner. To this entertainment they were all intitled; for the money, and grants of different kinds, which they had depofited on the foundation-ftones, were alone fuf¬ ficient to have raifed a very noble fabric.

"Hiftory. A R C H I T of this ftyle of archite£lure has been already confi- dered, and the charaifters by which it is diftinguifhed from the ancient Gothic have alfo been defcribed: (See n° 21. fupra.) Its firft appearance in England was towards the latter end of the reign of king Hen¬ ry II. But it was not at once thoroughly adopted ; fome fhort folid columns and femicircular arches being retained and mixed with the pointed ones ; as for ex¬ ample, in the well end of the Old Temple Church; and at York, where under the choir there remains much of the ancient work, the arches of which are but jud pointed and rife on fhort round pillars. In the reign of Henry III. however, this manner of build¬ ing feems to have gained a complete footing ; the cir¬ cular giving place to the pointed arch, and the maf- five column yielding to the flender pillar. Indeed, like all novelties, when once admitted, the rage of falhion made it become fo prevalent, that many of the ancient and folid buildings, eredled in former ages, were taken down in order to be re-edified in the new talle, or had additions patched to them, of this mode of architec¬ ture.

"As to the ftate of civilarchitedlure during the famepe- tiod: The houfes of the common people in the country, and of the lower burgeffes in towns and cities, were very little improved in their ftructure, that moft numerous and ttfeful order of men being much depreffed in the times we are now delineating. • Even in the capital city of London, all the houfes of mechanics and common bur- geffes were built of wood, and covered with ftraw or reeds, towards the end of the twelfth century. But the palaces, or rather caftles, of the Anglo-Norman tings, barons, and prelates, were very different from E C T U R E. 229 the refidences of perfims of the fame rank in the Anglo- Saxon times. For this we have the teftimony of a perfon of undoubted credit, who was well acquainted with them both. “ The Anglo-Saxon nobles (fays William of Malmfbury) fquandered away their ample revenues in low and mean houfes; but the French and Norman barons are very different from them, living at lefs expence, but in great and magnificent palaces.’’ The truth is, that the rage of building fortified caftles, was no lefs violent among the Norman princes, prelates, and barons, than that of building churches. To this they were prompted not only by the cullom of their native country, but alfo by their dangerous fituation in this ifland.

William of Sens, architeft to Archbilhop Lanfranc in building his cathe¬ dral, is faid, by Gervafe of Canterbury, to have been a moil exquifite artill both in ftone and wood. He made not only a model of the whole cathedral, but of every particularpiece of fculpture and carving, for the direction of the workmen, and invented many curious machines for loading and unloading fhips, and conveying heavy weights by land, becaufe all the ftones were brought from Normandy. Matthew Paris fpeaks even in a higher drain of Walter of Coventry, who flourilhed to¬ wards the end of this period, when he fays, that “ fo excellent an archited had never yet appeared, and pro¬ bably never would appear, in the world.” This enco¬ mium was undoubtedly too high ; but it is impoffible to view the remains of many magnificent fabrics, both facred and civil, that were ereded in this period, with¬ out admiring the genius of the architeds by whom they were planned, and the dexterity of the workmen by whom they were executed","Sens, Canterbury, Coventry","FR,GB,US",3,"France,United Kingdom,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"

Hence pe- deftals are, like columns, diftinguiftied by the names 1 of Tufcan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Compo- ’ Jite. 6cj 1 Some: authors are averfe to pedeftals, and compare Pedeftal* a column raifed on a pedeftal to a man mounted on'vhere P? ftilts ; imagining that they were introduced merely Per* * from neceuity, and1 for want of columns of a fuffi- cient length. It is indeed true, that the ancients of¬ ten made ufe of artifices to lengthen their columns; as appears by fome that are in the Baptiftery of Con- ftantine at Rome ; the ftiafts of which, being too fhort for the building, were lengthened and joined to their j bafes by an undulated' fweep, adorned with acanthus leaves. Neverthelefs, there are many occafions where j pedeftals are evidently neceffary ; and fome in which the order, were it not fo raifed, would lofe much of its beautiful appearance.' Thus, in the infides of churches, : if the columns that fupport the vault were placed im¬ mediately on the ground, the feats would hide their | bafes and a good part of their ftiafts; and in the theatres of the ancients; if the columns of the. feene.

How a- Sometimes their piers are rufticated ; femetiffies they doi'ne<1, are adorned with pilafters, termini, or caryatides ; and fometimes they are made fufficiently broad to ad¬ mit niches or windows. The circular part of the arch is either furrounded with ruftic key-ftones, or with an archivolt enriched with mouldings; which, in the middle, is fometimes interrupted by a confole, a malk, ferving at the fame time as a key to the arch, and as a fupport to the architrave of the order. The archivolt is fometimes fupported by an impoft, at the head of the pier; and at others by columns placed on each fide of it, with a regular entablature, or ar¬ chitrave and cornice. There are likewife inftances of arcades without piers, the arches being turned on fingle columns as in the temple of Faunus at Rome, &c.

"The edifice of the Areopagus was extremely fimpie; and its roof, which was at firll of the moll common materials, remained in that Hate till the time of Au- guitus. This we learn from Vitruvius.

"As to the number of the judges which compofed the Areopagus, fome authors, attentive only to a part of Solon’s regulations, by which he enafted, that for the future, none but the nine archons fhould be ad¬ mitted members of the Areopagus, have imagined, that this tribunal was filled anew every year, and that it never confifted of more than nine magiftrates. This opinion, and -fome others,' are refuted by the circum- llantial account which Diogenes Laertius gives us of the condemnation of Socrates. This great man had wifhed to fubftitute a rational hypothefis for the fa¬ bulous and extravagant lyflem of religion which pre¬ vailed in his time. His project, however laudable, appeared impious in the eye of fuperftition. Informa¬ tion was laid againft him before the Areopagus, and he had as many accufers as fellow-citizens. After the charges and the anfwers were heard, they proceeded to fufFrages. The opinions were divided, but not equal¬ ly, for the number of thofe who condemned him ex¬ ceeded by 281 the number of thofe who declared him innocent. He made an ironical reply to this iniqui¬ tous fentence, by telling his judges, that he took it for granted, they would admit him to a maintenance in the Prytanaeum. On this farcafm, 80 of thofe who had voted in his favour forfook him, went over to the oppofite party, and condemned him to die.

"Of all the judgments of the Areopagus, the moft famous one, excepting that of Mars, was the"" fentence which they palled on Oreftes. His trial, which hap¬ pened under Demophon the 12th king of Athens, in 375 of the Attic tera, owed all its fame to a remark¬ able circumllance, that gave rife to a cuftom which was obferved ever afterwards. Oreftes had killed his mother. He was accufed before the Areopagus, and cited to appear in that court. He would have loft his life in confequence of the equal divifion of the votes, had not Minerva, moved with his misfortunes, declared herfelf for thofe who had abfolved him, and joined her fuffrage to theirs. Thus Oreftes was faved. In ve¬ neration to this miracle, the Areopagites, whenever the fuffrages were equally divided, decided in favour of the accufed, by granting him what they termed the Jhell of Minerva.

The pope had feveral converfations with him, in all which he interro¬ gated him as to his knowledge in mufic ; and upon fight of an antiphonary which Guido had brought with him, marked with the fyllables agreeable to his new invention, the pope looked on it as a kind of prodigy ; and ruminating on the dodfritieS delivered by Guide, would not ftir from his feat till he had learned perfeflly to fing off a verfe : upon which he declared, that he could not have believed the efficacy of the method, if he had not been convinced by the experiment he had himfelf made of it. The pope would have detained him at Rome ; but labouring under a bodily difor- der, and fearing an injury to his health from the air of the place, and the heats of the fummer, which was then approaching, Guido left that city upon a promife to revifit it, and explain to his holinefi the principles of his new fyftem.

Helle was drowned by the way, in that fea which from her was called the Hellefpont, now the Dardanelles. This, according to fome, was the ground of the poetical fable, that a ram with a golden fleece fwam away with them to Colchis j and that the Argonauts undertook their famed expe¬ dition, in order to find that fleece. But Strabo and Arrian informs us, that it was a practice of the Col- chians to colledf gold on mount Caucafus by ex¬ tending fleeces acrofs the beds of the torrents 5 and as the water pafled, the metallic particles remain¬ ed entangled in the wool : hence"", according to thofe hiftorians, the adventure was named the expedition of the golden fleece.

About the year 1464, Regiomentanus, in his triangular tables, divided the Radius into 10,000 parts inftead of 60,000 ; and thus tacitly expelled the fexagefimal arithmetic. Part of it, however, ftill re¬ mains in the divifion of time, as of an hour into 60 minutes, a minute into 60 feconds, &c. Ramus in his arithmetic, written about the year 1550, and pu- bliffied by Lazarus Schonerus in 1586, ufes decimal periods in carrying on the fquare and cube roots to fraftions. The fame had been done before by our countrymen Buckley and Record ; but the firft who publiflied an exprefs treatife on decimals was Simon Stevinius, about the year 1582. As to the circulating decimals, Dr W allis is the firft who took much no¬ tice of them. He is alfo the author of the arithmetic of infinites, which has been very ufefully applied to geometry.

Arnold took fire at the news; an unufual fwell of enthufiafm filled his bread j and he fancied that, like Junius Brutus, he was called at once to give liberty to Rome.

He dwelt on the names and the at- chievements of the Bruti, the Gracchi, and the Scipios ; and of thefe men, faid he, are you not the children ? He advi'.ed, that the capitol be inflantly repaired ; that the equeftrian order be reftored ; that the people have their tribunes; that dignity attend the fenate ; and, that the laws, which had been filent ’and neglefted, be revived in all their vigour.

"As the progrefs of arts and fciences toward perfec¬ tion is greatly promoted by emulation, nothing is more fatal to an art or fcience than to remove that fpur, as where fome extraordinary genius appears who foars above rivallhip. Mathematics feem to be declining in Britain j the great Newton, having furpafled all the ancients, has not left to the moderns even the fainteft hope of equalling him ; and what man will enter the lilts who defpairs of viefory ? In a country thinly peopled, where even neceflary arts want, hands, it is common to fee one perfon ex- ercifing more arts than one : in feveral parts of Scot¬ land, one man ferves as a phyfician, furgeon, and apo¬ thecary. In every populous count ry, even Ample arts are fplitinto parts, and each part has an artift appro¬ priated to it. In the large towns of ancient Egypt, a phyfician was confined to a Angle difeafe. In me¬ chanic arts that method is excellent. As a hand con¬ fined to a Angle operation becomes both expert and ex¬ peditious, a mechanic art is perfected by having its dif¬ ferent operations dillributed among the greateft num¬ ber of hands : many hands are employed in making a watch, and a ftill greater number in manufacturing a web of woollen cloth. Various arts or op erations car¬ ried on by the fame man, envigorate his mind, becaufe they exercife different faculties j and as he cannot be equally expert in every art or operation, he is fre¬ quently reduced to fupply want of (kill by thought and invention. Conftaut application, on the contrary, to a fingle operation, confines the mind to a fingle objeCt, and excludes all thought and invention : in fuch a train of life, the operator becomes dull and ftu- pid, like a beaft of burden.

"360 } ART turned their thoughts to the latter. Beauty was flu- Arts, died in objeCts of fight; and men of tafte attached w—y-—"" themfelves to the fine arts, which multiplied their en¬ joyments, and improved their benevolence. Sculpture and painting made an early figure in Greece 5 which afforded p’enty of beautiful originals to be copied in thefe imitative arts. Statuary, a more fimple imita¬ tion than painting, was fooner brought to perfection s the ftatue of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno by Po- lycletes, though the admiration of all the world, were executed long before the art of light and (hade was known. Apollodorus, and Zeuxis his difciple, wh® flourifhed in the 15th Olympiad, were the firft wh» figured in that art. Another caufe concurred to ad¬ vance ilatuary before painting in Greece, viz. a great demand for ftatues of their gods. Architecture, as a fine art, made a flower progrefs. Proportions, upon which its elegance chiefly depends, cannot be accu¬ rately afcertained, but by an infinity of trials in great buildings ; a model cannot be relied on : for a large and a fmall building, even of the fame form, require different proportions. 4 From the fine arts mentioned, we proceed tolitera- Literary ture. It is agreed, among all antiquaries, that the cdmpoft- firlt writings were in verfe, and that writing in profe t‘on' was of a much later date. The firil Greek who wrote in profe was Pherecides Syrus: the firft Roman was Appius Caecus, who compofed a declamation againlt Pyrrhus. The four books of the Chatah Bhade, which is the facred book of Hindoftan, are compofed in verle ftanzas ; and the Arabian compofitions in profe followed long after thofe in verfe. To account for that lingular faCt, many learned pens have been employed 5 but without fuccefs. By fome it has been urged, that as memory is the only record of events where writing is unknown, hiftory originally was compcled in verfe for the fake of memory. This is not fatisfactory. To undertake the painful talk of compofing in verfe, mere¬ ly for the fake of memory, would require more fore¬ fight than ever was exerted by a barbarian : not to mention that other means wereufed for preferving the memory of remarkable events; a heapof itones* a pillar, or other objeCt that catches the eye. The account given by Longinus is more ingenious. In a fragment of bis treatife on verfe, the only part that remains, he obferves, “ that meafure or verfe belongs to poetry, becaufe poetry reprefents the various paflions with their language ; for which reafon the ancients, in their ordinary difcourfe, delivered their thoughts in verfe rather than in profe.” Longinus thought, that an¬ ciently men were more expofed to accidents and dan¬ gers, than when they were protected by good govern¬ ment and by fortified cities. But he feems not to have adverted, that fear and grief, infpired by dangers and misfortunes, are better fuited to humble profe than to elevated verle. It may be added, that however na¬ tural poetical didtion may be when one is animated with any vivid paflion, it is not fuppofable that the ancients never wrote nor fpoke but when excited by paflion. Their hiftory, their laws, their covenants, were certainly not compofed in that tone of mind","Jupiter, Roman","GR,US,RO",3,"Greece,United States,Romania","Europe,North America,Europe"
"compofition. The Roman hiftories before the time of '“■—v— Cicero are chronicles merely. Cato, Fabius Pidor, and Pifo, confined themfelves to naked fads. In the Auguftte Hifloriae Scriptores we find nothing but a jejune narrative of fads, commonly of very little mo¬ ment, concerning a degenerate people, without a fingle incident that can roufe the imagination or exer- cife the judgment.

"One would imagine, however, that thefe compofi- tions were too Ample to enchant for ever ; as variety in aCIion, fentiment, and paflion, is requiAte, without which the ftage will not continue long a favourite en¬ tertainment : and yet we find not a Angle improve¬ ment attempted after the days of Sophocles and Euri¬ pides. The manner of performance, indeed, prevented abfolutely any improvement. A fluctuation of paflion and refined leutiments would have made no figure on the Grecian fiage. Imagine the difcording fcene be¬ tween Brutus and Catfius ip Julius Caefar to be there exhibited, or the handkerchief in the Moor of Venice : how flight would be their effedt, wEen pronounced in a matk, and through a pipe ?

"Comedy. With refpeCt to comedy, it does not appear that the Greek comedy furpafled the tragedy in its progrefs toward perfection. Horace mentions three ftages of Greek comedy. The firtt well fuited to the rough and coarfe manners of the Greeks, when Eupolis, Cra- tinus, and Ariftophanes, wrote. Thefe authors were not afhamed to reprefent on the ftage real perfons, not even ditguifing their names: of which we have a lin¬ king inltance in a comedy of Ariftophanes, called The Clouds, where Socrates is introduced, and moft con- temptuouily treated. This fort of comedy, fparing neither gods nor men, wasreftrained by themagiflrates of Athens, fo far as to prohibit perfons to be named on the ftage. This led writers to do what is done atpre- fent: the characters and manners of known perfons were painted, fo much to the life, that there could be no miftake y and the fatire was indeed heightened by this regulation, as it was an additional pleafure to find out the names that were meant in the reprefentation",Athens,"GR,US",3,"Greece,United States","Europe,North America"
"We may judge of this from Plautus, whole compofi¬ tions are abundantly rude, though much admired by his cotemporaries, being the bed that exifted at that time. The exalted fpirit of the Romans hurried rhem on to the grand and beautiful ; and literary produc¬ tions of all kinds were in perfection when Auguftus reigned. In attempting dill greater perfection, the Roman compofitions became a drange jumble of incon¬ fident parts: they were tumid and pompous ; and, at the fame time, full of antithefes, conceit, and tinlel wit. Every thing new in the fine arts pleafes, though lefs perfect than what we are accudomed to ; and, for that reafbn, fuch compofitions were generally relidi- ed. We fee not by what gradual deps writers, after the time of Augudus, deviated from the patterns that were before them ; for no book of any moment after that time is preferved till we come down to Seneca, in whole works nature and fimplicity give place to ar¬ tificial thought and badard wit. He was a great cor¬ rupter of the Roman tade ; and after him nothing was relidied but brilliant drokes of fancy, with very little regard to fentiment: even Virgil and Cicero made no figure in comparifon. Lucan has a forced elevation of thought and dyle very difficult to be fup- ported ; and, accordingly, he finks often into puerile reflections; witnefs his encomium on the river Po ; which, fays he, would equal the Danube, had it the 7. z 2 fame ART [ 364 ] ART fame number of tributary ftreams. Quintilian, a wri¬ ter of true and claffical tafte, who was protected and encouraged by Vefpafian, attempted to ftem the tide of falle writing. His rhetoric is eompofed in an ele¬ gant ftyle-; and his oblervations contain every delicacy of the critical art. At the fame time flourifhed Ta- citps, poffc fling a more extenfive knowledge of the nature of man than any other author, ancient or mo¬ dern, if Shakefpeare be,not excepted. His ftyle is ori¬ ginal, concile, compafl, and comprehenfive j and, in what is properly called his hijiory, perfectly correct and beautiful. He has been imitated by feveral, but never equalled by any. Brutus is faid to be the laft of the Romans for love of liberty : Quintilian and Tacitus may be faid to be the laft of the Romans for literary genius. Pliny the younger is no exception 5 his ftyle is affe&ed, turgid, and full of cWldifh brilliancy. Se¬ neca and Pliny are proper examples of writers who ftu- dy fhow more than iubftance, and who make fenfe yield to found. The difference between thefe authors and thofe of the Auguftine age, refembles the difference be¬ tween Greek and Italian Mufic. Mufic, among the Greeks, limited itfelf to the employment to which it is deftined by nature, viz. to be the handmaid of fenfe, to enforce, enliven, or fweeten a fentiment. In the Italian opera, the miftrefs is degraded to be hand¬ maid ; and harmony triumphs, with very little regard to fentiment","Roman, Roman, Cicero, Lucan","RO,US,IE,GR,IT",3,"Romania,United States,Ireland,Greece,Italy","Europe,North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"Another great caufe that precipitates the downfal of every fine art is defpotifm. The reafbn is obvious j and there is a difmal example of it in Rome, particularly with regard to eloquence. We learn from a dialogue accounting for the corruption of the Roman eloquence, that in the decline of the art it became fafhionable to fluff harangues with impertinent poetical quotations, without any view but ornament merely ; and this alfo was long fafhionable in France. It happened unlucki¬ ly for the Romans, and for the world, that the fine arts were at their height in Rome, and not much upon the decline in Greece, when delpotifm put an end to the republic. Auguftus, it is true, retarded their fall, par¬ ticularly that of literature ; it being the politic of his reign to hide defpotifm, and to give his government an air of freedom. His court was a fchool of urbani¬ ty, where people of genius acquired that delicacy of tafte, that elevation of fentiment, and that purity of expreflion, which charatlerize the writers of his time","Rome, Roman, Rome","US,FR,GR,RO",3,"United States,France,Greece,Romania","North America,Europe,Europe,Europe"
"He honoured men of learning, admitted them to his table, and was bountiful to them. It would be pain¬ ful to follow the decline of the fine arts in Rome to their total extirpation. The tyranny of Tiberius, and of fubfequent emperors, broke at laft the elevated and- independent fpirit of the brave Romans, reduced them to abjedl flavery, and left not a fpark of genius. The fcience of law is the only exception, as it flourifhed even in the worft of times : the Roman lawyers were a re- fpe£table body, and lefs the obje<5l of jealoufy than men of power and extenfive landed property. Among the,greeks alfo, a conquered people, the fine arts de¬ cayed ; but not fb rapidly as at Rome ; the Greeks, farther removed from the feat of Government, being lefs within the reach of a Roman tyrant.

"There is ftili another-caufe that never fails to under¬ mine a fine art in a country where it is brought to perfedlion, abflrafting from every one of the caufes above mentioned, [t is remarked a little above, that nothing is more fatal to an art or to a fcience than a performance fo much fuperior to all of the kind as to extinguilh emulation. This remark is exemplified in the great Newton, who, having furpafled all the an cients, has not left to his countrymen even the fainted: hope of rivalling him ; and to that caufe is attributed the vifible decline of mathematics in Great Britain",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"The fame caufe would have been fatal to the arts of ftatuary and painting among the Greeks, even though they had continued a free people. The decay of paint¬ ing in modern Italy is, probably, owing to the fame caufe: Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, &c. are lofty oaks that bear down young plants in their neigh¬ bourhood, and intercept from them the funftiine of e- mulation. Had the art of painting made a flower pro¬ grefs in Italy, it might have there continued in vigour to this day. Velleius Paterculus fays judicioufly, “ Ut primo ad confequendos quos priores ducimus accendi- mur ; ita, ubi aut praeteriri aut aequari eos pofle de- fperavimus, ftudium cum fpe fenefcit; et quod adfe- qui non poteft, fequi definit: praeteritoque eo in quo eminere non poflimus, aliquid in quo nitamur conqui- rimus.” The decline of an art or fcience proceeding from the foregoing caufe, is the moft rapid where a ftri6t com¬ panion can be inftituted between the works of differ¬ ent mailers. The fuperiority of Newton above every other mathematician can be afcertained with precifion; and hence the fudden decline of that fcience in Great Britain.

"It has to many appeared matter of furprifie, that the battles of the ancients Ihould be defcribed with an or¬ der, perfpicuity, and circumftantial minutenefs, which are not to be found in the military writers of modern times.

But the difficulty will be better folved, Dr Gillies thinks, by refle&ing on the changes introduced- into the art of w'ar by the change of artillery 5 which in military-operations, form the pivot on which the whole turns. 1. From the nature of fire-arms, modern battles are involved in fmoke and confufion. 2.

"VIII. “ The hiftory of the difcovery of the Parian chronicle is obfcure and uhfatisfaHory.” Our author obferves, that it is attended with fome fufpicious cir- cumftances, and without any of thore clear and une¬ quivocal evidences which always difcriminate truth from fallehood. There are no data in the infcription by which to difcovex the place where the marble was eredfted. The place likewife where it was found is A unde- not afcertained ; though the generality of writers- who lian- have had occaficn to mention it have fuppofed that it v-‘—v—' was found in the iiland of Paros. If it was ereiled at Smyrna, as fome imagine, our author afks, for what purpole does the writer mention Allyanax the archon of Paros, and not one circum(lance relative to Smyrna f If, adds he, it was ereHed at Paros, why does he not mention more archons of that city than one ? Or how (hall we account for his profound filence with refpett to all the events and revolutions which mult have hap ¬ pened in that iflarid, and have been infinitely more in- terefting to the natives than the tranfifotions of any foreign country i1 The train of circumltances by which the Parian chronicle came into the polfeflion of Mr Petty, whom Lord Arundel had fent into the £u!t for the purpole of collecting antiquities, as well as the fubfequent con- ducft of Peirefc its former owner, affords our author a ftrong prefumption, that “ the infoription was actuallv fabricated, with the view of obtaining for it a high price, upon the pretence that it was a relic of great antiquity. It is certain, that there is fomething my- fterious in the conduct of the firft oftenfible proprietor.--","Smyrna, Smyrna",US,3,United States,North America
"In endeavouring, toward the end of his diflertation, to inveftigate the time of the fuppoled forgery, he ob¬ ferves, that the 16th century, and the prior part of the 17th produced a multitude of grammarians, critics, and commentators, deeply, verfed in Grecian literature, and amply qualified for the compilation of fuch a chro¬ nological fiyftem as that of the Arundelian marbles.- Aboveall, the foie nee of chronology was particularly ftudied and inveftigated about that time : “ Nunc fer- vet chronologia,” fays Scaliger in the year 1605, “ omnes hoc ferrum excalfaeiunt.” Cafaubon treats thofo perfons with contempt who were unacquainted with the improvements which had been made in that department of learning after the revival of letters. In¬ numerable fyflems of chronology had been publifhed before the year 1625 ; from which it was eafy to ex¬ tract a feries of memorable events, and give the com¬ pilation a Grecian drefs. “ The avidity,” fays our author, “ with which all relics of antiquity were then collected, and the high price at which they were pur- chafod, were fufficient inducements to any one, whole avarice or vvhofe neceffity was ftronger than his inte¬ grity, to engrave his labours on marble, and tranfmit them to Smyrna, as a commodious emporium for fuch rarities.” The precife period of the fabrication, however, muff: ftilL A R U t 384 ] A R TJ Ar-undo. fliU be x^eckoned apocryphal and uncertain. The mm y—j 0y gUineaSj which Pierefc gave to the fuppofed fabricator, was inadequate to Inch a laborious and ex- penfive work. Upon the whole, perhaps, it would be too hafty to pronounce decifively that this famous Chronicle, fo long refpefted, is an impofition upon the public. It may, however, be fafely affirmed, that the fufpicions againfl: it are extremely ftrong, and the objedlions already cited of a nature very difficult to be removed.

"the Phenicians derived their knowledge of this fcience from the Egyptians. They feem, however, to have been the firft who applied aftronomy to the purpofes of navigation ; by which they became maflers cf the fea, and of almoft all the commerce in the world.

"Eudoxus the Cnidian was a cotemporary with A- riftotle, though confiderably older, and is greatly cele¬ brated on account of his Ikill in aftronomy. He was the firft who introduced geometry into the fcience, and he is fuppofed to be the inventor of many propofitions attributed to Euclid. Having travelled into Egypt in the earlier part of his life, and obtained a recom¬ mendation from Agefilaus to Nedianebus king of Egypt, he, by his means, got accefs to the priefts, who had the knowledge of aftronomy entirely among them, after which he taught in Afia and Italy. Se¬ neca tells us that he brought the knowledge of the planetary motions from Egypt into Greece ; and Ar¬ chimedes, that he believed the diameter of the fun to be nine times that of the moon. He was alfo well acquainted with the method of drawing a fun-dial up¬ on a plane; from whence it may be inferred that he underftood the dodtrine of the projedlion of the fphere ; yet, notwithftanding what has been faid concerning the obfervations of Eudoxus, it is not certain that his fphere was not taken from one much more ancient, afcribed to Chiron the Centaur. The reafon given for this fuppofition is, that had the places of the ftars been taken from his own obfervations, the conftella- tions muft have been half a fign farther advanced than they are faid to be in his writings",Euclid,"EG,IT,GR,US",3,"Egypt,Italy,Greece,United States","Africa,Europe,Europe,North America"
"From this time the fcience of aftronomy continued greatly to advance.- Ariftarchus, who lived about 270 years before Chrift, ftrenuoufiy aflerted the Pathago- rean fyftem, and gave a method of determining the di- flance of the fun by the moon’s dichotomy. Eratof- thenes, born at Gyrene in 271 B. C. determined the meafure of a great circle of the earth by means of a gnomon. His reputation was fo great, that he was invited from Athens to Alexandria by Ptolemy Euer- getes, and made by him keeper of the royal library at that place. At his intiigation the fame prince fet up thofe armiilas or fpheres, which Hipparchus and Ptole¬ my the aftronomer afterwards employed fo fuceefsfully in obferving the heavens. He alfo found the diftance between the tropics to be eleven fueh parts as the whole meridian contains eighty-three. About the fame time Berofus, a native of Chaldea, flouriftied at A- thens. He is by fome faid to have brought many ob¬ fervations from Babylon, which are afcribed to the Greeks ; while others contend, that the latter owe I3 little or nothing of their aftronomical knowledge to Difcoveries the Babylonians. The celebrated Archimedes, who of Archi- next to Sir Haac Newton holds the firft place among tnedes. mathematicians, was nothing inferior as an aftronomrr to what he was as a geometrician. He determined the diftance of the moon from the earth, of Mercury from the moon, of Venus from Mercury, of the fun from Venus, of Mars from the fun, of Jupiter from Mars, and of Saturn from Jupiter ; as likewife the di- itance of the fixed ftars from the orbit of Saturn.

Having returned to Nuremberg in 1471, he was entertained by a wealthy citizen named Bernard IVzither, who having a great love for aftronomy, caufed feveral inftruments to be made under the direction of Regiomontanus, for obferving the altitude of the fun and ftars, and other celeftial phenomena. Among thefe was an armillary aftrolabe, like that which had been ufed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy at Alexandria, and with which many obfervations were made.

Benja¬ min Urfwus, an excellent mathematician of Branden¬ burg, calculated much larger tables of logarithms than had been done by their noble inventor, and publilhed them in 1625. They were improved by Henry Briggs, Savilian profiffor of Oxford; who by making unity the logarithm of ten, thus rendered them much more con¬ venient for the pnrpofes of calculation. Logarithmic tables of fines and tangents were alfo compofed by Mr Briggs and Adrian Vlacq at Goude, fo that the bufi- nefs of calculation was now rendered nearly as eafy as pofiible. 39 In 1633, Mr Horrox, a young aftronomer of very Trasfit of extraordinary talents, difcovered that Venus would pafs Vemis over the difk of the fun on the 24th of November 1639. This event he announced only to one friend, a Mr Crabtree ; and thefe two were the only perfons in the world who obferved this tranfit the firft time it had ever been viewed by human eyes. Mr Horrox made many ufeful obfervations at the time; and had even formed a new theory of the moon, fo ingenious as to attraft the notice of Sir Ifaac Newton : but the hopes of aftronomers from the abilities of this excel¬ lent young man were blafted by his death in the begin¬ ning of January 1640. 30 About the year 1638 many learned men began to Foundation aflemble at Paris in order to hold conferences on dif- ot t*'ie ^ca* ferent fcientific fubjedts, which was the firft; f°untlat>°n ^^5 of the Royal Academy of Sciences in that capital. r;s an(i This pradtice was introduced in France by Merfennus, Royal So- and foon after at London by Oldenburg; which laid defy at the foundation of the Royal Society there.

"Notwithftanding all thefe difcoveries by means of telefcopes, it was evident that they ftill continued in a very imperfeA ftate, and their imperfe&ions at the time appeared to be without remedy. One de¬ left was the enormous length requifite to admit of any very confiderable magnifying power ; and another was the incorreftnefs of the image, arifing from the aberration of the rays, as was then fuppofed, by the fpherical figure of the glafs. To obviate thefe inconveniences, Mer- fennus is faid to have firft propofed, in a letter to Defcartes, the ufe of refieftors inftead of lenfes in the conftruftion of telefcopes ; but this he did in fuch an obfcure manner, that the latter laboured to perfuade him of the falfehood of the principle on which his fcheme was founded. In 1663, however, James Gre¬ gory of Aberdeen (bowed how fuch a telefcope might be conftrufted. He (bowed alfo, that, in order to form a perfeft image of an objeft in this manner, the figure of the fpeculum ought to be parabolic ; but Sir Ifaac Newton, who applied himfelf to the framing of telefcopes of the reflefting kind, found it imprafticable to grind them of the defired figure. Laying afide the idea of reflefting telefcopes, therefore, he applied him¬ felf to the execution of a fcheme formed by Defcartes, •viz. that of grinding lenfes of the figure of one of the conic feftions.

But though he then obferved fome fpots upon her, he fays, that even when the air was quiet and clear, they appeared faint, irregular, and not well defined ; fo that it was difficult to have fuch a diftinCf view of any of them as to be certain that it was the fame fpot which was feen again in any i'ubfequent obfervation 5 and this difficulty was increa- fed, in the firft place, when Venus was in her inferior femicircle ; becaufe at that time file mud be viewed through the thick vapours near the horizon ; though otherwife it was mod proper, on account of her being then neared to us.

"He took notice alfo of a darkifii oblong fpot nearer to the northern than the fouthern horn : at funrife the bright part was advanced further from the fouthern horn than when he fird obferved it ; but though he was pleafed to find that he had now a convincing proof 5^ of the planet’s motion, he was fttrprifed that the fpots Why the moved from fouth to north in the lower part of thefi5015 diflt, and from north to fouth in the upper part} atonlove kind of motion of which we have no examole, except in the librations of the moon.

"But though, from the appearances jud now related,Caffid’s M.

Now (fuppo¬ fing the bright fpot obferved to be always the fame) whether this motion is an entire turning round, or on¬ ly a libration, is what I dare not pofitively affirm.” In i66(j Mr Caffini again obferved Venus through a telefcope, but could not then perceive any fpots up* on her furface; the reafon of which Du Hamel con- jeftures to have been the fluftuation of the vapours near the horizon, which prevented them from being vifible. However, we hear nothing more of any fpots „ being feen on her diflc till the year 1726; when, on tobferva-”1 * t^ie February, Bianchini, with fome of Cam- tions. pani’s telefcopes of 90 and 10® Roman palms, began to obferve the planet at the altitude of 40° above the horizon, and continued his obfervationa till, by the motion of feveral fpote, he determined the pofition of her axis to be inclined as above mentioned, that the north pole pointed at a circle of latitude drawn through the 20th degree of Aquarius, elevated 15 or 20® above the orbit of Venus. He delineated alfo the figures of feveral fpots which he fuppofed to be feas, and com¬ plimented the king of Portugal and fome other great men by calling them by their names. Though none of Bianchini’s obfervations were continued long enough to know whether the fpots, at the end'of the period affigned for the rotation of the planet, would have been in a different fituation from what they were at the beginning of it 5 yet, from obfervations of two and of four days, he concluded the motion of the fpots Doubts con-be at the rate of 150 per day; at which advance terning the the planet muff turn round either once in 24 days or time ihe ;n 23 hours; but without farther obfervation it could takes up in not be determined which of the two was the period of round her revolution : for if an obferver fhould at a particular axis. lioufy fuppofe feven in the evening, mark exactly the place of a fpot, and at the fame hour next evening find the fpot advanced 150, he would not be able to determine whether the fpot had advanced only 150, or had gone once quite round with the addition of 15^ more in part of another rotation. Mr Bianchini, however, fuppofes Venus to revolve in 24 days eight hours ; the principal proof adduced for which is an obfervation of three fpots, A B G, being fituated as Plate in fig. 44. when they were viewed by himfelf and fe- XXVI. veral perfons of diftin&ion forabout an hour, during which they could not perceive any change of place","Jupiter, Roman","PT,US,RO",3,"Portugal,United States,Romania","Europe,North America,Europe"
"“ Now (fays Mr Bianehini) if her rotation were fo fwift as to go round in 23 hours, in this fecond view, three hours after the former) the fpots mult have ad- N O M Y. 437 vanced near 50 degrees; fo that the fpot C would-Appearan- have been gone off at R, the fpot B would have fuc-^ ex¬ ceeded into the place of C, the fpot A into the plac , la ^ ’ 1S,’ of B, and there would have been no more but two fpots, A and B, to have been feen.” 73 Calfini, the fon, in a memoir for 1732, denies the Dif’ utc be- conclufion of Bianchini to be certain. He lays, that,tW!xr (-'afli- during the three hours interval, the fpot C might be gone off the difk, and the fpot B got into the place thereof, where, being near the edge, it would appear lefs than in the middle. That A, fucceeding into the place of B, would appear larger than it had done near the edge, and that another fpot might come into the place of A; and there were other fpots befides thefe three on the globe of the planet, as appears by the fi¬ gures of Bianehini himfdf, particularly one which would naturally come in the place of A. That if the rotation of Venus be fuppofed to be in 23 hours, it will agree with Bianchini’s obfervations, as well as with thofe of his father ; but that, on the other fuppofition, the latter muff be entirely rejefted as erroneous: and be concludes with telling us, that Venus had frequent¬ ly been obferved in the moft favourable times by Mr Maraldi and himfelf with excellent telefcopes of 80 and loo feet focus, without their being able to fee any di- flinft fpot upon her difk. “ Perhaps, (fays Dr Long)) thofe feen by Bianchini had difappeared, or the air in France was not clear enough ; which lafl might be the reafon why his father could never fee thofe fpots in France which he had obferved in Italy, even when he made ufe of the longeft telefcopes.” Neither of thefe aftronomers take notice of any indentings in the curve which divides the illuminated part from the dark in the difk of Venus, though in fome views of that planet by Fontana and Ricciolus, the curve is indented ; and it has from thence been concluded, that the furface of the planet is mountainous like that of the moon. This had alfo been fuppofed by Burratini, already mention¬ ed ; and a late writer has obferved, that ‘‘when the air is in a good ftate for obfervation, mountains like thofe of the moon may be obferved with a very power¬ ful telefcope.” 74 Caffini, befides the difeovery of the fpots on the diflc CalTini diP of Venus by which he was enabled to afeertain her re-cov^.s her volution on an axis, had alfo a view of her fatellite orla e lte* moon, of which he gives the following account.-—- “ A. D. 1686, Aug. 28th, at 15 minutes after four in the morning, looking at Venus with a teleicope of 34 feet, I faw, at the diftance of one third of her dia¬ meter eaftward, a luminous appearance, of a fhape not well defined, that feemed to have the fame phafe with Venus, which was then gibbous on the wetttrn fide",Fontana,"FR,IT,US",3,"France,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"From this time the fatellite of Venus, though very frequently looked for by aftronomers, could never be perceive^ which made it generally believed that Caffi- ni and Mr Short had been miftaken ; but as the tran- fits of the planet over the fun in 1761 and 1769 feem- ed to promife a greater certainty of finding it, the fa¬ tellite was very carefully looked for by almoft every one who had an opportunity of feeing the tranfit, but generally without fuccefs. Mr Baudouin at Paris had provided a telefcope of 25 feet, in order to obferve the paffage of the planet over the fun, and to look for its M^ne^tellite ; but he did not fucceed either at that time or at the tran-in the months of April and May following. Mr Mon- fit in 1761. taigne, however, one of the members of the Society of .Limoges, had better fuccefs. On the 3d of May 1761, he perceived, about half an hour after nine at night, at the diftance of 20' from Venus,, a fmall cref- oent, with the horns pointing the fame way as thofe of the planet 5 the diameter of the former being about one-fourth of that of the latter; and a line drawn from Venus to the fatellite making an angle with the verti¬ cal of about 20^ towards the fouth.

"5. Much larger and more remarkable fpots have been perceived on the difk of Mars than that of any other primary planet. They were firft obferved in 1666 by Calfini at Bologna with a telefcope of Campani about 16’ feet long; and continuing to obferve them for aMars, month, he found they came into the fame fituation in 24 hours and 4c1) minutes. The planet was obferved by fome aftronomers at Rome with longer telefcopes made by Euttachio Divini ; but they affigned to it a rotation in 13 hours only. This, however, was af¬ terwards fhown by Mr Caflini to have been a mif- take, and to have arifen from their not diftinguifning the oppofite fides of the planer, which it feems have fpots pretty much alike. He made further obferva¬ tions ou the fpots of this planet in 1670; from whence he drew an additional confirmation of the time the planet took to revolve. The fpots were again obfer¬ ved in fubfequent oppofitions ; particularly for feveral days in 1704 by Maraldi, who took notice that they were not always well defined, and that they not only changed their fhape frequently in the fpace between two oppofitions, but even in the fpace of a month","Much, Bologna, Rome","DE,IT,US",3,"Germany,Italy,United States","Europe,Europe,North America"
"Some of them, however, continued of the fame form long enough to afcertain the time of the planet’s revo¬ lution. Among thefe there appeared this year an ob¬ long fpot, refembling one of the belts of Jupiter when broken. It did not reach quite round the body of the planet ; but had, not far from the middle of it, a fmall protuberance towards the north, fo well defined that he was thereby enabled to fettle the period of its revolution at 24 hours 39 minutes ; only one minute lefs than what Cafiini had determined it to be. Set Plate fig. 45. lxvij; The near approach of Mars to the earth in 1719, gave a much better opportunity of viewing him than -had been obtained before; as he was then within 2% deg. of his perihelion, and at the fame time in oppofition to the fun.

From other pheno¬ mena it appears, however, that this planet is not with¬ out a confiderable atmofphere ; for befides the perma¬ nent fpots on its furface, I have often noticed occafion- al changes of partial bright belts, and alfo once a dark- jfh one in a pretty high latitude ; and thefe alterations we can hardly aferibe to any other caufe than the va¬ riable difpofuion of clouds and vapours floating in the atmofphere of the planet.” 91 6.

On the 9th of May 1664, Dr Hook, with a good 12 feet telefcope, obferved a fmall fpot in the biggeft of the three obfeure belts of Jupiter ; and obferving it from time to time, found that in two hours it had moved from eaft to weft about half the vifible .diameter of the planet.

It continued there¬ on till the year following; long enough to determine the periodical time of Jupiter’s rotation upon his axis to be nine hours 56 minutes.” This principal, or an- Acc^u3nt af cient fpot as it is called, is the largeft, and of thdoneof tiiepe longeft continuance of any hitherto known, and has ap-fpots","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America

The longeft time of its continuing to be vifible was three years ; and the longeft time of its difappearing was from 1708 to 1713: it feems to have fome cbnneftion with the principal fou- thern belt ; for the fpot has never been feen when that difappeared, though that belt has often been vifible without the fpot. Befides this ancient fpot, Caffini, in the year 1699, faw one °f liability that did not continue of the fame fhape or dimenflons, but broke into feveral fmall ones, whereof the revolution was but nine hours 31 minutes; and two other fpots that re¬ volved in nine hours 52 minutes and a half.

Fig. 85, ta-tl’e ken from Newton’s Pripcipia, reprefents fo much ofot 1 the traje&ory of this comet as it paffed through while it was vifible to the inhabitants of our earth, in going from and returning to its perihelion. It {hows alfo the tail, as k appeared on the days mentioned in the figure. The tail, like that of other comets, increafed in length and brighthefs as it came nearer to the fun ; and grew fhorter and fainter as it went farther from him and from the earth, till that and the comet were too far.off to be any longer vifible. uj “ The comet of 1744 was firft feen at Laufanne in Of that of Switzerland, Dec. J3th, 1743, From that time1?44, it increafed in brightnefs and magnitude as it was co¬ ming nearer to the fun. The diameter of it, when at the diftance of the fun from us, meafured about one minute 5 which brings it out equal to three times the diameter of the earth. It came fo near Mercury, that, if its attraffion had been proportionable to its magni¬ tude, it was thought probable it would have difturbed the motion of that planet. Mr Betts of Oxford, how¬ ever, from fome obfervations made there, and at Lord Macclesfield’s obfervatory at Sherburn, found, that when the comet was at its leaft diftance from Mercury, and almoft twice as near the fun as that planet was, it was ftill diftant from him a fifth part of the diftance of the fun from the earth ; and could therefore have no effedf upon the planet’s motions. He judged the co¬ met to be at leaft equal in magnitude to the earth.

"“ Again, a flux and reflux of the igneous matter, fo confiderable as fometimes to produce a great number of fpots all over the middle zone, might affeft the appa¬ rent diameter of the fun, making that which pafles through his equator lefs than the polar one, by the re¬ treat of the igneous matter towards thofe regions where no fpots ever appear. But as a difference of this kind, of nearly one thoufandth part of the whole, would be per¬ ceivable, as we lea^n from M. de la Lande’s own ob- fervations, compared with thofe of Mr Short in Hi- ftoire Acad. 1760, p. 123, it would feem, that the theory had this difficulty alfo to combat. Further, when among fpots very near one another fome are ob- ferved to be increafing whilft others are diminilhing, how is it poffible this can be the effeft of fuch a fup- pofed flux and reflux ?

Concerning the moon, it is allowed on all hands, Great ine- that there are prodigious inequalities on her furface. qualities ou This is proved by looking at her through a telefcope,^.6 furfacc at any other time than when (he is full ; for then there of the is no regular line bounding light and darknefs ; but the confines of thefe parts appear as it were toothed and cut with innumerable notches and breaks ; and even in the dark part, near the borders of the lucid furface, there are feen fome fmall fpaces enlightened by the fun’s beams. Upon the fourth day after new moon, there may be perceived fome (hining points like rocks or fmall iflands within the dark body of the moon ; but not far from the confines of light and darknefs there are obferved other little fpaces w'hich join to the en¬ lightened furface, but run out into the dark fide, which by degrees change their figure, till at laft they come wholly within the illuminated face, and have no dark parts round them at all. Afterwards many more fhin- ing fpaces are obferved to arife by degrees, and to ap¬ pear within the dark fide of the moon, which before they drew near to the confines of light and darknefs were invifible, being without any light, and totally im¬ merfed in the (hadow. The contrary is obferved in the decreafing phafes, where the lucid fpaces which joined the illuminated furface by degrees recede from it, and, after they are quite feparated from the confines of light and darknefs, remain for fome time vifible, till at laft they alfo difappear. Now it is impoffible that this (hould be the cafe, unlefs thefe (hining points were higher than the reft of the furface, fo that the light of the fun may reach them.

He then mentions Kepler’s opinion, that the crown of light which appears round the moon du¬ ring the total darknefs in an eclipfe of the fun, is cau- fed by fome celeftial matter furrounding the moon, of fufficient denfity to receive the rays of the fun and fend them to us ; and that the moon may have an at¬ mofphere fimilar to that of our earth, which may re- fradl the fun’s light. i^0 A total cclipfe of the fun was obferved on the 22dDr Halley’s of April O. S. in the year 1715, by Dr Halley at Lon*account ot' don, and by M.'Louville of the Academy of Sciences3 o ar.c' at Paris. Dr Halley relates, that “ when the fir ft part the fun remained on his eaft fide, it grew very faint, and was eafily fupportable to the naked eye even through the telefcope, for above a mirrute of time before the total darknefs ; whereas, on the contrary, the eye could not endure the fplendour of the emerging beams through the telefcope even from the firft moment. To this, two caufes perhaps corrcurred : the one, that the pupil of the eye did neceffarily. dilate itfelf during the dark¬ nefs, which before had been much contra&ed by look¬ ing on the fun : the other, that the eaftern parts of the moon, having been heated with a day near as long as 30 of ours, ntuft of neceffity have that part of its atmofphere replste with vapours raifed by the fo long continued aftion of the fun ; and, by confequence, it was more denfe near the moon’s furface, and more ca¬ pable of obftriufting the fun’s beams; whereas at the fame time the weftern edge of the moon had fuffered as long a night, during which there might fall in dews all the vapours that were raifed in the preceding long day ; and for that reafon, that that part of its atmo- fphere might be feeu much more pure and tranfparenf",Paris,US,3,United States,North America

The contrary, however, has anoon. fometimes been obferved, and the ftars have been feen manifeftly to change their lhape and colour on going behind the moon’s dilk. An inftance of this happen¬ ed on the 28th of June N. S. in the year 1715, when an occultation of Venus by the moon happened in the day-time. Some aftronomers in France obferving this with a telefcope, faw Venus change colour for about a minute before (he was hid by the moon ; and the fame change of colour was obferved immediately after her emerfion from behind the diflt. At both times the edge of the di(k of Venus that was neareft the moon appeared reddifh, and that which was moft diftant of a bluilh, colour. Thefe appearances, however, which might have been taken for proofs of a lunar atmo¬ fphere, were fuppofed to be owing to the obfervers ha¬ ving diredted the axis of their telefcopes towards the moon.

On Venus, for in- this'doc- fiance, the heat muft be more than double what it is trine. with us, and* on Mercury upwards of ten times as great; fo that were our earth brought as near the fun as Mercury, every drop of liquid would be evaporated into (team, and every combuftible folid fet on fire ; while, on the other hand, were we removed to the di- ftance of the fuperior planets, fuch as the Georgium Sidus, Saturn, or even Jupiter, there is the higheft probability that our liquids would all be congealed into ice, at the fame time that the climate would be utterly infupportable by fuch creatures as we are. Objeflions of the fame kind are drawn from the fmall quantity of light which falls upon the more diilant planets, which 160 it is thought would be infufficient for the purpofes of fnconclu- Jiving and rational creatures. -Such arguments as thefe, lve* however, are by no means eonclufive; for, as Dr .

However, even that can fcarcely be affirmed of all the planets; for the warmelt climate on the planet Mars is not colder than many parts of Norway or Lapland are in the fpring or autumn. Jupiter, Saturn, and the Geor¬ gium Sidus, it muft be granted, are colder than any of the inhabited parts of our globe. The greateit heat on the planet Venus exceeds the heat on the ifland of St Thomas on the coaft of Guinea, or Sumatra in the Eaft Indies, about as much as the heat in thofe places exceeds that of the Orkney iflands, or the city of Stockholm in Sweden : therefore, at 6o° north latitude on that planet, if its axis were perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the heat would not exceed the greateft heat on the earth ; and of courfe vegeta¬ tion like ours might be there carried on, and animals of the fpecies on earth might fubfift.

Apian, Tycho-Bra he, and ^regoins _ others, thought the tail was formed by the fun’s raysceSi tranfmitted through the nucleus of the comet, which —y—j they fancied tranfparent, and was there refrafted as in a lens of glai's, fo as to form a beam of light behind the comet : but this cannot be the cafe, as wellbecaufe the figure of a comet’s tail does not anfwer to fuch a ref rad ion, as that fuch refra&ed light would not be feen by a fpe&ator placed fideways to it, unlefs it fell upon fome fubftance fufficiently denfe to caufe a refleftion. Des Cartes and his followers were of opi- Opinion of nion, that the tail of a comet was owing to the refrac-Des Cartes, tion ofits head : but if this were the cafe, the planets and principal fixed ftars muft have tails alfo ; for the rays From them pafs through the fame medium as the light from the comets. Sir Ifaac Newton was of opinion, that the tail of a comet is a very thin vapour which the head fends out by reafon of its heat: that it afcends from the fun juft as fmoke does from the earth : that as the afcent of fmoke is caufed by the rarefadtion of the air wherein it is entangled, caufing fuch air to afcend and carry the fmoke up with it; fo the fun’s rays adling upon the coma or atmofphere of the co¬ met, do by rarefaftion and refradtion heat the fame: that this heated atmofphereheats, and by heating rarefies, the ether that is involved therein; and that the fpecific gravity with which fuch ether tends to the fun, is fo diminiihed by its rarefadFion, that it will now afcend from him by its relative lightnefs, and carry with it the reflecting particles whereof the tail is compofed. Tho’ the immenfely large tails of fome comets feem to re¬ quire a great quantity of matter to produce them, this is no objedtion to the foregoing folution : for every day’s experience ftiows what a great quantity of fmoke is produced from a very little wood or coal; and New¬ ton has demonftrated, that a cubic inch of air equally rarefied with that at the diftance of a femidiameter from the earth’s furface, would fill all the planetary regions to the orbit of Jkturn and beyond. Mairan entertained a very different opinion. He fuppofed the tails of the comets to be formed out of the luminous matter whereof the fun’s atmofphere confifts. This he fuppofes to extend as far as the orbit of the earth, and to furnifh matter for the aurora borealis. M. de la Lande is for joining the two laft opinions together",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"Part of the matter which forms the tails of comets he fuppofes to arife from their own atmofphere rarefied by heat and pufhed forward by the force of the light ftreaming from the fun ; and alfo that a comet palling through the fun’s atmofphere is drenched therein, and carries away fome of it. Mr Downing objedls to New¬ ton’s account, that it can hardly be luppofed the thin vapour of the tail Ihould go before the morefolid body , of the comet, when the motion thereof is fometimes fo extremely fwift, as that of fome of the comets is faid to be after the rate, as Sir liaac Newton calculated the motion of the comet of 1680 to be, of no lefs than 880,0.00 miles an hour. He therefore fuppofes the atmofphere of the comet to extend every way round it as far as the tail readies ; and that the part of it which makes the tail is diftinguilhed from the reft, fo as to fall thick upon that pan of the atmolphere which goes before the comet in its progrefs along its elliptic orbit",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"The many difcoveries which, lince t]ie time of New¬ ton, Halley, and other celebrated mathematicians, have been made in ele&ricity, having brought in a new ele¬ ment unknown to former ages, and which fhows a vail power through every part of the creation with which we are acquainted, it became natural to imagine that it mull extern! alio into thofe higher regions which are altogether inacceffible to man. The fimilarity cf the tails of comets to the aurora borealis, which is com¬ monly looked upon to be an eledlrical phenomenon, therefore fuggefted an opinion at prefent far from being generally dilbelieved, that the tails of comets are jgo dreams of eleftric matter.

"“ But there is, I think, a further confideration, which will diow that the received opinion, as to the afcent of comets tails, is not agreeable to the pheno¬ mena, and may at the fame time lead us to fome know¬ ledge of the matter of which thefe tails confid ; which I fufpedl is of a very different nature from what it has been hitherto fuppofed to be. Sir Ifaac fays, the va¬ pours, of which the tail of a comet confids, grow hot by reflefting the rays of the fun, and thereby warm and rarefy the medium which furrounds them ; which mud therefore afeend from the fun, and carry with it the refledling particles of which the tail is formed 5 for he always fpeaks of the tail as fliining by refleded light. But one would rather imagine, from the phe¬ nomena, that the matter which forms a comet’s tail has not the lead fenfible power of refle&ing the rays of light. For it appears from Sir Ifaac’s obfervation which I have quoted already, that the light of the fmalled dars, coming to us through the immenfe thick- nefs of a comet’s tail, does not fuffer the lead diminu¬ tion. And yet, if the tail can refled the light of the fun fo copioufly as it mud do if its great fplendour be ow¬ ing to fuch refledion, it mud undoubtedly have the fame effed on the light of the dars ; that is, it mull refled back the light which comes from the dars be¬ hind it, and by fo doing mud intercept them from our fight, confidering its vail thicknefs, and how exceed¬ ingly flender a ray is that comes from a fmall ftar 5 or if it did not intercept their whole light, it mud at lead increafe their twinkling. But we do not find that it has even this fmall effrd $ for thofe dars that appear through the tail are not obferved to twinkle more than 5 N others 466 ASTRONOMY. Sett. Ill, Conclusions others in their neighbourhood. Since therefore this from the faft ;s fupported by obfervations, what can be a plainer foregoing proof tj)at (jjg matter of a comet’s tail has no power of ^>pcaran' rt.fle&ing the rays of light ? and confequently that it * , .' be a felf-fhining fubftance. But the fame thing will further appear, From confidering that bodies refleft and refraft light by one and the fame power ; and therefore if comets tails want the power of refraffing the rays of light, they muft alfo want the power of re- fle&ing them. Now, that they want this refracting pow'er appears from hence : If that great column of stranfparent matter which forms a comet’s tail, and moves either in a vacuum or in fome medium of a dif- sferent denfity from its own, had any power of refrac¬ ting a ray of light coming through it from a ftar to ns, that ray muft be turned far out of its way in paf- fing over the great diftance between the comet and the earth ; and therefore we (hould very fenfibly perceive the fmalleft refraftioti that the light of the ftars might fuffer in paffing through a comet’s tail. The con- fequence of fuch a refraffion muft be very remarkable : the ftars that lie near the tail would, in fome cafes, ap¬ pear double ; for they would appear in their proper pla¬ ces by their direCl rays, and we fttould fee their images behind the tail, by means of their rays which it might refraCl to our eyes ; and thofe ftars that were really be¬ hind the tail would difappear in fome lituations, their rays being turned afide from us by refraftion. In fhort, it is eafy to imagine what ftrange alterations would be made in the apparent places of the fixed ftars by the tails of comets, if they had a power of refrac¬ ting their light, which could not fail to be taken no¬ tice of if any fuch ever happened. But fince aftrono- mers have not mentioned any fuch apparent changes of place among the ftars, I take it for granted that the ftars feen through all parts of a comet’s tail appear in their proper places, and with their ufual colours ; and eonfequently I infer, that the rays of light fuffer no re- fra&ion in paffing through a comet’s tail. And thence I conclude (as before), that the matter of a comet’s tail Iras not theptower of refrafting or reflefting the rays of light, and muft therefore be a lucid or felf-fhining ^ fubftance.” 431r Jfaac’s But whatever probability the Doftor’s conje&ure account de-concerning lbe materials whereof the tails are formed fended. may have in it, his criticifm on Sir Ifaac Newton’s ac¬ count of them feems not to be juft : for that great phi- Jofopher fuppofes the comets to have an atrr.ofphere pe¬ culiar to themfelves ; and confequently, in their neareft approaches to the fun, both comet and atmofphere are immerfed in the atmofphere of that luminary. In this cafe, the atmofphere of the comet being prodigioufly heated on the fide next to the fun, and confequently •the equilibrium in it broken, the denfer parts will con¬ tinually pour in from the regions fartheft from the fun ; for the fame reafon., the more rarefied part which is be¬ fore will continually fly off oppofite to the fun, being difplaced by that which comes from behind ; for tho’ we muft fuppofe the comet and its atmofphere to be heated on all fides to an extreme degree, yet ftill that part which is fartheft from the fun will be lefs hot, and confequently more denfe, than what is nearett to his body. The confequence of this is, that there muft be a conftant ftream of denfe atmofphere defeending to¬ wards the fun, and another ftream of rarefied vapours and atmofphere afeending on the contrary fide ; juft as Conclufions in a Common fire, there is a conftant ftream of denfe from the air defeending, which pulhes up another of rarefied *°reSoing air, flame, and fmoke. The refiftance of the folarce^pcaran' atmofphere may indeed be very vvell.fuppofed to occa-1   , fion the curvature obfervable in the tails of comets, and their being better defined in the fore part than be- hind 5 and this appearance we think Dr Hamilton’s Dr jjamil- hypothefis is incapable of folving. We grant, that ton’s hypo- there is the utmoft probability that the tails of comets thffis infuf- are ftreams of eleftric matter ; but they who advance ®c'€nt* a theory of any kind ought to folve every phenome¬ non, otherwife their theory is infufficient. It was in¬ cumbent on Dr Hamilton, therefore, to have explained how this ftream of ele&ric matter comes to be bent into a curve ; and alfo why it is better defined and brighter on the outer fide of the arch than on the in¬ ner. This, indeed, he attempts in the following man¬ ner : “ But that this curvature was not owing to any refilling matter appears from hence, that the tail muft be bent into a curve, though it met with no refiftance ; for it could not be a right line, unlefs all its particles were proje&ed in parallel direftions, and with the fame velocity, and unlefs the comet moved uniformly in a right line. But the comet moves in a curve, and each part of the tail is projefted in a dire&ion oppofite to the fun, and at the fame time partakes of the motion of the comet 5 fo that the different parts of the tail muft move on in lines which diverge from each other ; and a line drawn from the head of a comet to the ex¬ tremity of the tail, will be parallel to a line drawn from the fun to the place where the comet was when that part of the tail began to afeend, as Sir Ifaac obferves j and fo all the chords or lines drawn from the head of the comet to the intermediate parts of the tail, will be refpeftively parallel to lines drawn from the fun to the places where the comet was when thefe parts of the tail began to afeend. And therefore, fince thefe chords of the tail will be of different lengths, and parallel to different lines, they muft make different angles with a great circle paffing through the fun and comet; and confequently a line paffing through their extremities will be a curve",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"“ It is obferved, that the convex fide of the tail which is turned from the fun is better defined, and fliines a little brighter, than the concave fide. Sir Ifaac accounts for this, by faying, that the vapour on the convex fide is frefher (that is, has afeended later) than that on the concave fide ; and yet I cannot fee how the particles'on the convex fide can be thought to have afeended later than thofe on the concave fide which may be nearer to the head of the comet.

"The near approach of fome comets to the fun fub- jedts them to intenfe and inconceivable degrees of heat. jgj Newton calculated that the heat of the comet of 1680 Vehement mud have been near zcoo times as great as that of red-heat of the hot iron. The calculation is founded upon this Pr‘n*c^^to£ ciple, that the heat of the fun falling upon any body at different diftances is reciprocally as the fquares of thofe diftances; but it may be obferved, that the ef¬ fedt of the heat of the fun upon all bodies near our earth depends very much on the conftitution of thofe bodies, and of the air that furrounds them. “ The comet in queftion (lays Dr Long) certainly acquired a prodigious heat; but I cannot think it came up to what the calculation makes it: the effedt of the ftrong- eft burning-glafs that has ever been made ufe of was the vitrification of mod bodies placed in its focus",Newton,US,3,United States,North America

Newton places all thefe apparent changes to the atmofphere that environs them ; which muft be very denfe near the furface, and have clouds floating therein. It was his opinion, that the changes mention¬ ed may all be in the clouds, not in the nucleus. This laft indeed he looked upon to be a body of extreme fo- lidity, in order to fuftain fuch an intenfe heat as the comets are fometimes deftined to undergo ; and that, notwithftanding their running out into the immenfe re¬ gions of fpace, where they were expofed to the moft intenfe degrees of cold, they would hardly be cooled again on their return to the fun. Indeed, accord¬ ing to his calculation, the comet of 1680 muft be for ever in a ftate of violent ignition. He hath com¬ puted that a globe of red-hot iron of the fame dimen- fions with the earth, would fcarce be cool in 50,000 years. If then the comet be fuppofed to cool 100 times fafter than red-hot iron, as its heat was 2000 times greater, it muft require upwards of a million of years to cool it. In the fhort period of 575 years, therefore, its heat will be in a manner fcarce dimi- nifhed ; and, of confequence, in its next and every fuc- ceeding revolution, it muft acquire an increafe of heat: fo that, fince the creation, having received a propor¬ tional addition in every fucceeding revolution, it muft now be in a ftate of ignition very little inferior to that of the fun itfelf. Sir Ifaac Newton hath farther concluded, that this comet muft be confiderably re¬ tarded in every fucceeding revolution by the atmo¬ fphere of the fun within which it enters 5 and this muft continually come nearer and nearer his body, till at laft it falls into it. This, he thinks, may be one ufe of the comets, to furnifh fuel for the fun, which otherwife would be in danger of wafting from the continual emif- fion of its light","Newton, Newton",US,3,United States,North America

In confe- Of the pe- quence of this, the mean diftance of a comet from the thnes^&c ^Un ma^ ke f°un^ hy comparing its period with the of the’ C’ t'me t^ie earth’s revolution round the fun. Thus comets, the period of the comet that appeared in 1531, 1607, 1682, and 1759, being about 76 years, its mean di- flance from the fun may be found by this proportion : As 1, the fquare of one year, the earth’s periodical time, is to 5776 the fquare of 76, the comet’s periodical time; fo is 1,000,©00, the cube of too the earth’s mean diftance from the fun, to 5,776,000,000, the cube of the comet’s mean diftance. The cube root of this laft number is 1794; the mean diftance itfelf in fuch parts as the mean diftance of the earth from the fun contains too. If the perihelion diftance of this comet, 58, be taken from 3588 double the mean diftance, we fhall have the aphelion diftance, 3530, of fuch parts as the diftance of the earth contains ico; which is a little more than 35 times the diftance of the earth from the fun. By a like method, the aphelion diftance of the comet of 1680 comes out 138 times the mean diftance of the earth from the fun, fuppofing its period to be 575 years: fo that this comet, in its aphelion, goes more than 14 times the diftance from the fun that Sa¬ turn does. Euler computes the orbit of this comet from three of Jlamftead’s obfervations taken near together, compared with a fourth taken at fome di- flance from the other three; and from thence concludes the period to be a little more than 170 years. “ It feems fomething furprifing (fays Dr Long), that, from the fame obfervations which were ufed by New¬ ton and Halley, he fhould bring out a period fo very different from what thofe great men have determined : but it is the lefs to be wondered at, if we confider how fmall a portion of the comet’s orbit lay between the moft diftant places ufed in this computation, or indeed that could be had for that purpofe; fo fmall, that the form of the ellipfis cannot be found with precifion by this method, except the comet’s places were more ex- aftly verified than is poffible to be done : and that he does not pretend to confirm his determination of the period by pointing out and comparing together any former appearances of this comet; a method which Newton recommended as the only one whereby the periodical times and tranfverfe diameters of the orbits of the comets can be determined with accuracy.” The period of the comet in 1744 is much longer than even that of 1680. Mr Betts, in attempting to compute the tranfverfe axis of its orbit, found it come out fo near infinite, that, though the orbit fhowed itfelf in this manner to be a very long one, he found it impof- fible to calculate it without fome obfervations made Dr Halley a^ter *ts perihelion. Halley, after he had finilhed his calculates table of comets, found fuch a fimilitude in the elements the return of thofe of 1531, 1607, and 1682, that he was indu¬ ct comets. ced to believe them to be returns of the fame comet in an elliptic orbit: but as there was fuch a difference in their periodical times and inclinations of their or¬ bits as feemed to make againft this opinion ; and as the obfervations of the firll of them in 1531 by Appian, and the fecond in 1607 by Kepler, were not exa& e-Conclufions nough to determine fo nice a point when he firft pub- ^rom t.*ie liflied his fynopfis in 1705 ; he only mentioned this as A^Wanfu- a thing probable, and recommended it to pofterity toccs> watch for an appearance of the fame in 1758. After-i—y—J wards, looking over the catalogue of ancient comets, and finding three others at equal intervals with thofe now mentioned, he grew more politive in his opi¬ nion ; and knowing a method of calculating with eafe a motion in an elliptic orbit, how eccentric foever it might be, inltead of the parabolic orbit which he had given for tire comet of 1682, he let about adapting the plan of that orbit to an ellipfis of a given fpace and magnitude, having the fun in one of its foci, fo as to tally with the obfervations of that comet made by Flam- ftead with great accuracy, by the help of a very large fextant. He likewife corredled the places of the comet of 1531 from Appian, and thofe of the comet 1607 from Kepler and Longomontanus, by re&ifying the places of the ftars they had made ufe of, and found thofe places agree as well with the motion in fuch an ellipfis as could be expe&ed from the manner of ob- ferving of thefe aftronomers, and the imperfections of their inftruments. The greateft objection to this theory was fome difference in the inclination of the orbits, and that there was above a year’s difference be- jpr tween the two periods. The comet of 1531 was in Why the its perihelion Augull 24. ; that of 1607, O&ober 16.; periodical and that of 1682, September 4. : fo that the firft c,f^t”g""s<^a thefe periods was more than 76, the latter not quite 75 years. To obviate this, he reminds his readers ofuneqUai an obfervation made by him of the periodical revolu-intervals, tion of Saturn having at one time been about 13 days longer than at another time ; occafioned, as he fup- pofed, by the near approach of Saturn and Jupiter, and the mutual attradtion and gravitation of the two pla¬ nets : and obferves, that in the fummer of the year 1681, the comet in its defeent was for fome time fo near Ju¬ piter, that its gravitation towards that planet was one- fiftieth part of its gravitation towards the fun. This, he concluded, would caufe a change in the inclination of its orbit, and alfo in the velocity of its motion : for by continuing longer near the planet Jupiter on the fide moft remote from the fun, its velocity would be more increafed by the joint forces of both thofe bodies, than it would be diminilhed by them adting contrary- wife, when on the fide next the fun where its motion was fwifteft. The projedtile motion being thus in¬ creafed, its orbit would be enlarged, and its period lengthened ; fo that he thought it probable it would not return till after a longer period than 76 years, about the end of the year 1758 or beguiling of i?59* As Halley exprefied his opinion modeftly, though clearly enough, that this comet would appear again about the end of 1758, or the beginning of the fol¬ lowing year, M. de la Lande pretends he muft have been at a lofs to know whether the period he foretold would have been of 75 or of 76 years ; that he did not give a decilive predidlion, as if it had been the re- fult of calculation ; and that, by confidering the affair in fo loofe a manner as Halley did, there was a good deal of room for objefting to his reafoning.

Thefe proved a ready and effectual falvo for all the defe&s of his fyftem ; as, whenever a planet was deviating from the courfc it ought on his plan to have followed, it was then only moving in an epicycle or an eccentric, and would in due time fail into its proper path.

It will be eafily conceived, that there is no more turned off from that line ; fo that in the point H, other point in the line BC fo near to A as the point the line AK will be more obliquely inclined to the B ; that AB is the fhorteft of all the lines which can curve line BHIK than the fame line AHD is inclined - fee drawn from A to any part of the line BC ; all others, to BC at the point D ; at the point I the inclination as AD or AE, being longer than AB. Hence it fol- of the line A1 to the curve line will be more diffe- lows, that the body felting out from it, if it moved rent from the inclination of the fame line AIE to the in the line BC, would recede more and more from line BC at the point IE ; and in the points K and E the point A.

"Then, it follows, from the fecond law of motion, that fince the body was moving in the line AB when it re¬ ceived the impulfe in the direction DC, it will have mo¬ ved after th^t impulfe through the line DE in the fame time as it would have moved through DF, provided it had received no difturbance in D. But the time of the body’s movi ig from D to E is fuppofed to be equal to the time of its moving through AD; therefore the time which the body would have employed in moving through DF, had it not been difturbed in D, is equal to the time wherein it moved through AD: confe- qnently DF is equal in length to AD ; for if the bo¬ dy had gone on to move through the line AB without ; 3 Q_. inter- - ASTRO Of Certtri- intemfption, it would have moved through allAthe petal parts of it with the fame velocity, and have pa {fed over Bowers. ^ eqUa] parts of that line in equal portions of time. Now v CF being drawn, fince AD and DF are equal, the tri¬ angular Ipace CDF is equal to the triangular fpace CAD. Further, the line EF being parallel to CD, it follows from the 37th propofition of Euclid’s firft book, that the triangle CED is equal to the triangle CFD : thereforethe triangle CED is equal to the triangle CAD",Euclid,US,3,United States,North America
"which continually circulating round, fhould carry the Of Gentrt- planets along with it; and there is one appearanceP813* which feems to favour this opinion, viz. that thef,°wcrs- fun turns round his axis the fame way the planets ' move ; the earth alfo turns round its axis the fame way as the moon turns round the earth ; and the pla¬ net Jupiter turns round his axis the fame way that his fatellites revolve round him. It might therefore be fuppofed, that if the whole planetary region were fill¬ ed with a fluid matter, the fun, by turning round on his own axis, might communicate motion firft to that part of the fluid which was contiguous, and by degrees propagate the like motion to the parts more remote",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"After the fame manner the earth might communicate motion to this fluid to a degree fufficient to carry round the moon ; and Jupiter might communicate the like to the diftance of its fatellites. This fyftem has been particularly examined by Sir Ifaac Newton ; who finds, that the velocities with which the parts of this fluid (hould move in different diftances from the centre of motion, will not agree with the motions obferved in the different planets ; for inftance, that the time of one entire circulation of the fluid wherein Jupiter lliould fwim, would bear a greater propoition to the time of one entire circulation of the fluid where the earth is, than the period of Jupiter bears to that of the earth. He proves alfo, that the planet cannot cir¬ culate in fuch a fluid, fo as to keep long in the fame courfe. unlefs the planet and the contiguous fluid are of the fame denfity, and the planet be carried along with the fame velocity as the fluid. There is alfo ano¬ ther remark made on this motion by Sir ifaac, viz","Jupiter, Newton, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"We muft likewife obferve, that as the planets do not move in perfeft circles round the fun, there is a great¬ er diftance between their orbits in fome places than others. For inftance, the diftance between the orbit of Mars and Venus is near half as great again in fome part of their courfe as in others. Now here the fluid in which the earth {hould fwim, muft move with a lefs rapid motion where there is this greater interval be¬ tween the contiguous orbits ; but, on the contrary, where the fpace is ftraiteft, the earth moves more flowly than where it is widelK Again, if our globe of earth fvvam in a fluid of e- qual denfity with the earth itfelf, that is, in a fluid more denfe than water, all bodies put in motion here upon the earth’s furface muft fuffer a great refiftance by it; whereas Sir Ifaac Newton has made it evident, by experiments, that bodies, falling perpendicularly through the air, fuffer only about a hundred and fix- tieth part of the refiftance from it that they meet with in water",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"“ But now (fays Mr Pemberton) in thefe demon-View ef Sir-- ftrations, fome very minute inequalities in the motion-5^ Nev>- of the planets are negledled ; which is done with 2Lt°n* PbHo- great deal of judgment : for whatever be their caufe, the effeds are very inconfiderable, they being fo ex¬ ceedingly fmall, that fome aftronomers have though fit wholly to pafs them by. Kow-ever, the excellen- nations in cy of this philofophy, when in the hands of fo great athe plane- geometer as our author (Sir Ifaac Newton), is fuch, tfry mo- that it is able to trace the leall variations of things to their caufes. The only inequalities which havej°”n been obferved common to all the planets are, the mo¬ tion of the aphelion and the nodes. The tranfverfe axis of each orbit does not remain always- fixed, but moves about the fun with a very flow, progrefiive mo¬ tion ; nor do the planets-keep conftantly in the fame planes, but change them and the lines by which thefe Z6S planes interfed each other by infenfible degrees. TheMotionof firft; of thefe inequalities, which is the motion of thetheaphe- aphelion, may be accounted for, by fuppofing the gra |^^coun’ vitation of the planets towards the fun to differ a little farther from the forementioned reciprocal duplicate proportion of the diftances ; but the fecond, which is the motion of the nodes, cannot be accounted for by any power direded towards the fun ; for no fuch power can give it any lateral impulfe to divert it from the plane of its motion into any new plane, but of ne- cefiity muft be derived from fome other centre. Where 3 that 492 ASTRO Motions of that power is lodged, remains to be difeovered. Now the Prima- ;t js proved, as fliall be afterwards explained, that the ry anets.^ t}jree primary planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and the Earth, ' which have fatellites revolving about them, are endow¬ ed with a power of caufing bodies, in particular thofe fatellites, to gravitate towards them with a force which is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of their di- ftances; and the planets are, in all refpe&s in which they come under our confideration, fo fimilar and alike, that there is no reafon to queftion but they have all the fame property, though it be fufficient for the prefent purpofe to have it proved of Jupiter and Sa¬ turn only; for thefe planets contain much greater quantities of matter than the reft, and proportionally exceed the others in power. But the influence of thefe two planets being allowed, it is evident how the pla¬ nets come to (hift their places continually : for each of the planets moving in a different plane, the aflion of Jupiter and Saturn upon the reft will be oblique to the planes of their motion, and therefore will gra¬ dually draw them into new ones. The fame aftion of thefe two planets upon the reft will likewife caufe a progreflive motion ; and therefore will gradually draw them into new ones. The fame aftion of thefe two planets upon the reft will likewtfe caufe a progreffive motion of the aphelion ; fo that there will be no ne- ceffity for having recourfe to the other caufe for this motion, which was before hinted at, viz. the gravita¬ tion of the planets toward the fun differing from the exaft duplicate proportion of their diftances. And in the laft place, the aftion of Jupiter and Saturn upon each other will produce in their motions the fame in¬ equalities as their joint aftion produces upon the reft","Newton, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"Jupiter and Yet fome of thefe other inequalities are difcernible in Saturn in- Jupiter and Saturn; in Saturn chiefly: for when Jupiter, Auenceeach wdm moves faftet-than Saturn, approaches to a con- other s mo'jun&;on with him, his adion upon the latter will a lit¬ tle retard the motion of that planet ; and by the reci¬ procal adion of Saturn, he will himfelf be accelerated","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"After conjundion, Jupiter will again accelerate Saturn, and be likewife retarded in the fame degree as before the firft was retarded and the latter accelerated",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"Whatever inequalities befides are produced in the mo¬ tion of Saturn by the adion of Jupiter upon that pla¬ net, will be fufficiently redified by placing the focus of Saturn’s ellipfia, which fliould otherwife be in the fun, N O M Y. Sed. IV, in the common centre of gravity of the fun and Jupi-Motions of ter. And all the inequalities of Jupiter’s motions,the caufed by the adion of Saturn upon him, are much ?y P ar‘cti; lefs confiderable than the irregularities of Saturn’s mo- tion. This one principle therefore of the planets ha¬ ving a power as well as the fun to caufe bodies gravi¬ tate towards them, which is proved by the motion of the fecondary planets to obtain in fad, explains all the irregularities relating to the planetary motions ever ob- ferved by aftronomers (a). jy® “ Sir Ifaac Newton after this proceeds to make an Method of improvement in aftronomy, by applying this theory tocoireffinS the farther corredion of their motions. For as we have here obferved the planets to poflefs a principle gravitation as well as the fun ; fo it will be explained at large hereafter, that the third law of motion, which makes adion and readion equal, is to be applied in this cafe, and that the fun does not only attrad each planet, but is alfo itfelf attraded by them ; the force wherewith the planet is aded on, bearing to the force wherewith the fun itfelf is aded upon at the fame time, the proportion which the quantity of matter in the fun bears to the quantity of matter in the planet","Jupiter, Jupiter, Newton",US,3,United States,North America
"From the adion of the fun and planet being thus mu-Sun moves tual, Sir Ifaac Newton proves that the fun and 'planetround the will deferibe about their common centre of gravity fi- common milar elliples ; and then, that the tranfverfe axis of thec®”‘f' ellipfes, which would be deferibed about the fun at re A hhn'and'the in the lame time, the fame proportion as the quantity planets, of folid matter in the fun and planet together bears to the firft of two mean proportionals between this quan¬ tity and the quantity of matter in the fun only",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"But whereas the fun was at firft concluded to be the centre to which the power ading on the planets was direded, becaufe the fpaces deferibed in equal times round the fun were found to be equal ; fo Sir Ifaac Newton proves, that if the fun and planet move round their common centre of gravity, yet, to an eye placed in the planet, the fpaces which will appear to be de¬ feribed about the fun will have the fame relation to the times of their defeription as the real fpaces would if the fun were at reft. I further aflerted, that, fup¬ pofing the planets to move round the fun at reft, and to be attraded by a power which fliould every where ad with degrees of ftrength reciprocally in the dupli¬ cate proportions of their diftances ; then the periods of the planets mult obferve the fame relations to their diftances as aftronomers have found them to do. But here it mull not be fuppofed, that the obfervations of aftronomers abfolutely agree without any the leaft dif¬ ference : and the prefent corre6tion will not caufe a deviation (a) Profeflbr J. Robifon, however, informs us in his paper on the Georgium Sidus (Edinburgh Philofophical Tranfadions, Vol. I.), That all the irregularities in the planetary motions cannot be accounted for from the laws of gravitation ; for which reafon he was obliged to fuppofe the exiflence of planets beyond the orbit of Saturn, even before the difeovery of the Georgium Sidus.

"Secondaries The firft thing demonftrated of thefe fecondary pla- -attrafted nets is, that they are drawn towards their refpeftive t«y their primaries in the fame manner as the latter are attradled .primaries. ^ ^ fhaj eacjj feCondary planet is kept in its orbit by a power diredled towards its primary, &c. is proved from the phenomenon of the fatellites of Jupi¬ ter and Saturn; becaufe they move in, circles, as far as we can obferve, about their refpedlive primaries with an equable courfe, the primary being the centre cif each orbit: and by comparing the times in which O N O M Y. 493 the different fatellites of the fame primary perform tlidir Motions of periods, they are found to obferve the fame relation to^1’® s^n' the diilances from their primary, as the primary planets obferve in refpedt of their mean diftances from thee—-y~—j fun. The fame thing holds good alfo with regard to the earth and moon ; for fhe is found to move round the earth in an ellipfis after the fame manner as the primary planets do about the fun, excepting only fome fmall irregularities in her motions, the caufe of which will be particularly explained in what follows ; where¬ by it will appear that they are no objtdlions againfl: the earth’s adling on the moon in the fame manner as the fun adts on the primary planets; that is, as Jupiter and Saturn adt upon their fatellites. 274 By the number of fatellites which move round Ju-Tower of piter and Saturn, the power of each of thefe planets Jupitcrf.n.<i may be meafured to a very confiderable diftance ; for covered by the diftance of the outermoil fatellite in each of thefetheii iatei- planets exceeds feveral times the diftance of the inner-lites",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"Earth and I11 th'8 computation the earth is fuppofed to be at moon move reft : but it would have been more exaft to have fup- about their pofed it to move, as well as the moon, about their common common centre of gravity ; as will eafily be underftood centre of £rc)m Jias been already faid concerning the motion of the fun and primary planets about their common centre of gravity. The aftion of the fun upon the moon is alfo here negledled ; and Sir Ifaac Newton fhows, if you take in both thefe confiderations, the prefent computation will beft agree to a fomewhat ;rreater diftance of the moon and earth, viz. to femidiameters of the latter, which diftance is more conformable to ailronomical obfervations ; and thefc computations afford an additional proof that the action of the earth obferves the fame proportion to the diftance which is here contended for. In Jupiter and Saturn this power is fo far from being confined to a fmall ex¬ tent cf fpace, that it not only reaches to feveral fatel- lites at very different diftances, but alfo from one pla¬ net to another, nay, even through the whole plane¬ tary fyftem ; confequently, there is no appearance of reafon why this power (hould not aft at all diftances, even at the very furfaces of thefe planets, as well as farther off. But from hence it follows, that the power which regains the moon in her orbit is the fame as that which caufes bodies near the furface of the earth to gravitate*; for fince the power by which, the earth a£ts on the moon will cauie bodies near the fur¬ face of it to defcend with all the velocity they are fouift to do, it is certain no other power can aft upon them befides ; becaufe, if it did, they muft of neceflity defcend fwifter. Now, from all this, it is at length very evident, that the power in the earth which we cal! gravity extends up to the moon, and decreafes in the duplicate proportion of the increafe of the di¬ ftance from t.he earth",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"Ifaac Newton informs us, that upon examination he planets found, that if any of the fatellites of Jupiter were at-etluahy at- trafted by the fun more or lefs than Jupiter himfelf at tfa^5d the fame diftance, the orbit of that fatellite, inftead of ^th their being concentrical to Jupiter, would have its centre pnij,ari£j, at a greater or leffer diftance than the centre of Jupi¬ ter from the fun, nearly in the fubduplicate proportion of the difference between the fun’s aftion upon the fs- tellite and upon Jupiter. Therefore, if any fatellite were attrafted by the fun but one hundredth part more or lefs than Jupiter is at the fame diffance, the orbit of that fatellite would be diftant from the centre of Jupiter no lefs than a fifth part of the outermoft fa¬ tellite from Jupiter; which is almoft the whole diftance of the innermoft latellite. By the like argument, the fatellites of Saturn gravitate towards the fun as much as Saturn itfelf at the fame diftance, and the moon as much as the earth. 2gj Thus it is proved, that the fun afts upon the fecon-Whence dary planets as much as upon the primaries at the fame tje inequa* diftance: but it has alfo been ftiown, that the aftion 'n t^c of the fun upon bodies is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the diftance ; therefore the fecondary ary planet* planets being fometimes nearer to the fun than to the arife","Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"Sir Ifaac Newton has fliown, that if the moon were attra&ed toward the earth by a compofition of two powers, one of which were reciprocally in the dupli¬ cate proportion of the diffance from the earth, and the other reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the fame diftance ; then, though the line defcribed by the moon would not be in reality an ellipfis, yet the moon’s motion might be perfedtly explained by an ellipfis wh'ofe axis fiiould be made to move round the earth ; this motion being in confequence, as aftronomers exprefs themfdvesj that is} the fame way as the moon itfelf moveOj Sea.

"general, that when the power by which the moon h attrafted to the earth, by varying the diftance, in- creafes in a greater than the duplicate proportion of t-lie diftance diminifhed, a motion in confequence muft; be aferibed to the apogeon ; but that when the attrac¬ tion increafes in a fmaller proportion than that juft mentioned, the apogeon muft have given to it a mo¬ tion in antecedence. It is then obferved by Sir Ifaac Newton, that the former of thefe cafes obtains when the moon is in the conjun&ion and oppolition, and the latter when fhe is in the quarters ; fo that in the for¬ mer the apogeon moves according to the order of the figns; in the other, the contrary way. But, as has been already mentioned, the difturbance given to the aftion of the earth by the fun in the conjun&ion and oppofition, being near twice as great as in the quar¬ ters, the apogeon will advance with a greater velocity than recede, and in the compafs of a whole revolution of the moon will be carried in confequence. ^ Sir Ifaac fhovvs, in the next place, that when the Inequality line AB coincides with the line that joins the fun andin the mo- earth, the progreffive motion of the apogeon, when t'on of ^ the moon is in conjunction or oppofition, exceeds theap05e01:’, retrograde, in the quadratures, more than in any other fituation of the line AB. On the contrary, when the line AB makes right angles with that which joins the earth and fun, the retrograde motion will be more con- fiderable, nay, is found fo great as to exceed the pro- grefiive ; fo that in this cafe the apogeon, in the com¬ pafs of an entire revolution of the moon, is carried in antecedence. Yet from the confiderations already men¬ tioned, the progrefiive motion exceeds the other ; fo with which the moon muft fet out from the point that on the whole, the motion of the apogeon is ia A, in order to deferihe the path AE. Let the confequence. The line AB alfo changes its fituation angle ATC be taken toward the moon, as in fig. 133, if the moon be attradted by the fum of the powers ; but the contrary way (as in fig. 134.) if by their diffe¬ rence. Then let the line AB be moved into the pofi- tion CD, and the ellipfis AMB into the fituation CND, fo that the point M be tranflated to L 5 then the point L fhall fall upon the path of the moon AE",Newton,US,3,United States,North America
"The motion of the apogeon and the changes in the eccentricity have not been computed by Sir Ifaac. 2oS The fame incomparable geometer fhows how, by How to comparing the periods of the motions pf the fatellites compute which revolve round Jupiter and Saturn with the pe-th? inequa* riod of our moon round the earth, and the periods oflitic? of thfc thofe planets round the fun with our earth’s motion, w°er’sL the inequalities in the motion of thofe fatellites may betellites.

"That thefe bodies are not meteors in our air is ma» nifeft, becaufe they.rife and fet in the fame manner as the moon and ftars. The aftronomers had gone fo far in their inquiries concerning them, as to prove by their obfervations that they moved in the celeftial fpaces be¬ yond the moon; but they had no notion of the path which they deferibed. Before the time of our author, it was fuppofed that they moved in ftraight Iin$s; and Des Cartes, finding that fuch a motion would interfere with his vortices, removed them entirely out of the folar fy- 2 ftem. Sir Ifaac Newton, however, diftintlly proves Cometf ge- from aftronomical obfervation, that the comets pafs ""craliy in- through the planetary regions, and are generally Jnvi-vifib^e unt!l fible at a fmaller diftance than that of Jupiter. Hence,thcy c°Te finding that they were evidently within the fphere of Jupiter, the fun’s a&jon, he concludes, that they muft neceffi»rilyJ move about the fun as the planets do ; and he proves, that the power of the fun being reciprocally in the du¬ plicate proportion of the diftance, every body a&ed upon by him muft either fall dire&ly down, or move about him in one of the conic fc&ions ; viz. either the ellipfis, parabola, or hyperbola. If a body which de¬ feends towards the fun as low as the orbit of any pla¬ net, move with a fwifter motion than the planet, it will deferibe an orbit of a more oblong figure than that of the planet, and have at leaft a longer axis. The velo¬ city of the body may be fo great, that it ffiall move in a parabola ; fo that having once pafled the fun, it (hail afeend for ever without returning, though the fun will ftill continue in the focus of that parabola ; and with a velocity ftill greater, they will move in an hyperbola","Newton, Jupiter, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"■ ‘ • That the comets do move in this manner is pro- 3o0 ved by our author from Computations built upon the They moveobfervations made by many aftronomers. Thefe com- in eccentricputations were made by Sir Ifaac Newton himfelf up- cihpies. Qn tjie comet which appeared toward tire latter end of the year t68o and beginning of 1681, and the fame were profecuted more at large by Dr Halley upon this and other comets. They depend on this principle, that the eccentricity of the orbits of the comets is fo great, that if they are really elliptical, yet that part of them which comes under our view approaches fo near to a parabola that they, may be taken for fuch without any fenfible error, as in the foregoing figure the parabola FAG, in the lower part of it about A, differs very little from the ellipfis DEAD; on which foundation Sir 1- flow to faac Caches a method of finding the parabola in which calculate any comet moves, by three obfervations made upon it the motion that part of its orbit where it agrees neareft with a pa- a comet. rab0]a ; and this theory is confirmed by aftronomical ob¬ fervations ; for the places of the comets may thus be com¬ puted as exadtly as thofe of the primary planets. Our author afterwards (hows how to make ufe of any fmall deviation from the parabola which may be obferved, to determine whether the orbits of the comets be elliptical or not; and thus to know whether or not the fame co¬ met returns at different feafons. On examining by this rule the comet of 1680, he found its drbit to agree more exadtly with an ellipfis than a parabola, thos the ellipfis be fo very eccentric, that it cannot perform its revolution in 500 years. On this Dr Halley obferved, that mention is made in hiftory of a comet with a fimi- lar large tail, which appeared three feveral times be¬ fore. The firft was before the death of Julius Caefar ; and each appearance happened at the interval of 5^5 years, the laft coinciding with the year 1680. He therefore calculated the motion of this comet to be in fuch an eccentric orbit, that it could not return in lefs than 575 years ; which computations agree yet more perfedfly with the obfervations made on this comet than any parabolic orbit will do. To compare together dif¬ ferent appearances of the fame comet, is indeed the only method of difcovering with certainty the form of its or¬ bit ; for it is impoffible to difcover the form of one fo exceedingly eccentric from obfervations taken in a fmall part of it. Sir Ifaac Newton therefore propofes to com¬ pare the orbits, on the fuppofition that they are parabo¬ lical, of fuch comets as appear at different times ; for if we find the fame orbit deferibed by a comet at diffe-* rent times, in all probability it will be the fame comet that deferibes it. Here he remarks from Dr Halley, that the fame orbit very nearly agrees to two appear¬ ances of a comet about the fpace of 75 years diftance ; Ip that if thefe two appearances were really of the fame comet, the tranverfe axis of its orbit would be 18 times that of the axis of the earth’s orbit ; and therefore, when at its greateft diftance from the fun, this* comet would be removed not lefs than 35 times the mean di¬ ftance of the earth from the fame luminary","Newton, Newton",US,3,United States,North America
"S°3 The Aftronomer Royal advertifes us of the ex- Nature an*! pe&ed return of the comet of 1532 and 1661, in ^”sof latter end of the year 1788, or beginning of 1789, inllrtets the following particulars. u—y— “ The elements of the orbits of the comets obfer¬ ved by Appian in 1532, and by Hevelius in 1661, are fo much alike as to have induced Mr Halley to fuppofc them to be one and the fame comet ; and aftronomers fince have joined in the fame opinion. Hence it fhould return to its perihelium the 27th of April 1789. But from the difturbances of the planets, it will probably- come a few months fooner. It will firft be feen in the fouthern parts of the heavens, if any aftronomers fhould watch for it in fituations near the line, or in fouthern climates, in the courfe of the year 1788, and probably not before the month of September.

As thefe methods, how¬ ever, have been found liable to fome uncertainty, Sir Ifaac'Newton had recourfe to experiments made on pendulums. Thefe vibrate by the fame power which makes heavy bodies fall to the ground ; but if the ball ©f any pendulum of the fame length with another were more or lefs attra&ed in proportion to the quantity of folid matter it contains, that pendulum mutt then vi¬ brate fafter or flower than the other. Now the vibra¬ tions of pendulums continue for a long time, and the number of vibrations they make may be eafily deter¬ mined without any fufpicion of error 5 fo that this ex¬ periment may be extended to what exadtnefs we pleafe : and Sir Ifaac affures us, that he examined in this way feveral fubftances, as gold, filver, lead, glafs, fand, common fait, wood, water, and wheat ; in all which he found not the leafl; deviation from the theory, tho* he made the experiment in fuch a manner, that in bo¬ dies of the fame weight, a difference in the quantity of their matter lefs than the thoufandth part of the whole ■would have difcovered itfelf. It appears, therefore, that all bodies are made to defcend here by the power of gravity with the fame degree of fwiftnefs. This de- icent has already been determined at 16-J- feet in a fe- cond from the beginning of their fall. It has alfo been obferved, that if any terreftrial body could be convey¬ ed as high up as the moon, it would defcend with the very fame degree of velocity with which the moon is attrafted toward the earth 5 and therefore that the power of the earth upon the moon bears the fame pro¬ portion it would have upon thofe bodies at the fame ^04 diftance as the quantity of matter in the moon bears Attrattion t0 t^ie quantity in thofe bodies. Thus the affertion is proportion-proved in the earth, that its power on every body it «d to the attracts is, at the fame diftance from the earth, propor- quantity of tjonaj t0 ^ qUant;ty of folid matter in the body afted a el'1 upon. As to the fun, it has been fhown, that the power of his adtion upon the fame primary planet is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion ofiits diftance ; and that the power of the fun decreafes throughout in the fame proportion, is teftified by the motion of the planets traverfing the whole planetary region. This proves, that if any planet were removed from the fun to any diftance whatever, the degree of its acceleration towards the fun vvould yet be reciprocally in the dupli¬ cate proportion o'f their diftance. But it has already been proved, that the degree of acceleration given to the planets by the fun is reciprocally in the duplicate pro¬ portion of their refpe&ive diftances ; all which, compa¬ red together, puts it out cf doubt, that the power of the fun upon any planet removed into the place of any other, would give it the fame velocity of defcent as it gives that other 5 and confequently that the fun’s ac¬ tion upon different planets at the fame diftance would be proportionable to the quantity cf matter in each. It has likewife been flicwn, that the fun attra&s the pri¬ mary planets and their refpedlive fecondaries, when at '^0 33s,","Of, Bo, Newton","TR,SL,US",3,"Turkey,Sierra Leone,United States","Asia,Africa,North America"
"This point being granted, it is hardly to be fuppo- fed that the power of attra&ion with which the other planets are endowed, ftiould be different from that of the earth, if we confider the fimilitude of thefe bodies : and that it does not in this refpeff, is farther evi¬ dent from the fatellites of Saturn and Jupiter, which are attradled according to this law ; that is, in the fame proportion to their diftances that their primaries are attrafted by the fun. So that what has been concluded of the fun in relation to the primary planets, may be juftly concluded of thofe primaries in refpeft to their fecondaries; and in confequence of that likewife in re¬ gard to all other bodies, viz. that they will attraft every other body in proportion to the quantity of fo¬ lid matter it contains. Hence it follows, that this at- tra&ion extends itfelf to every particle of matter in the attracted body, and that no portion of matter is exempted from the influence of thefe bodies to which this attra&ive power has been proved to belong. 303",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"the fateliice. By computations of this kind it is found, that the weight of any body on the furface of the fun will be about 23 times as gr^at as on the furface of the earth ; about 10 times as great as on the furface of Jupiter; and near 19 times as great as on Saturn",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"The quantity of matter contained in each of thefe bo¬ dies is proportional to the power it has upon a body at a given diftance. Thus it is found, that the fun contains 1067 times as much matter as Jupiter ; Jupi¬ ter I58J- times as much as the earth, and 2J- times as much as Saturn. The diameter of the fun, according to the data with which Sir Ifaac Newton was furnifhed, was calculated at 92 times, that of Jupiter about 9 times, and that of Saturn about 7 times as large as the diameter of the earth","Jupiter, Newton, Jupiter",US,3,United States,North America
"Denfittes of % comparing the quantities of matter in each of the heaven-thefe bodies with their refpeaive magnitudes, theirden- ly bodies, fities are likewife eafily difeovered ; the denfity of every body being meafured by the quantity of matter con¬ tained under the fame bulk. Thus the earth is found 4J. times more denfe than Jupiter, while Saturn has only between two thirds and three-fourths of the den¬ fity of the latter, and the fun has only one-fourth part of the denfity of the earth. From all this our author draws the following conclufions, viz. That the fun is ra¬ refied by its great heat ; and of the three planets above- mentioned, the moft denfe is that neareft the fun. This it was highly reafonable to expert, the denfeft bodies requiring the greateft heat tfl agitate and keep their parts in motion ; as on the contrary, the planets which are more rare would be rendered unfit for their office by the intenfe heat to which the denfer are expofed",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America

Phenome- From the general account of thofe laws by which the univerfe is upheld, we now’ proceed to give an ex¬ planation of the particular parts of which it is com- pofed. Thofe which are nioft expofed to our refearches, befides the earth we inhabit, are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Geor¬ gium Sidus (fee fig. 119.). The fun, an immenfe globe of fire, is fituated near the centre of tlje fy flem, round which he turns by a (mall and irregular motion, according as the common centre of gravity betwixt him and the planets, which is the^true centre of the fyftem, varies by their different pofitions on this or that fide of him. All the planets move round this common centre of gravity together with the fun ; but the lat¬ ter, by reafon of his vaft bulk, is fo near the true cen¬ tre, that the motions of the celeftial bodies are by aftro- nomers always referred to the centre of the fun as the point round which they are diredted. The motions of all of them are performed the fame way, viz. from weft to eaft ; and feme comets have been obferved to move alfo in this way, though the motion of others has been diredfly contrary. This motion, from welt to eaft, is faid to be in the order of the figns,’or in confe- quence, as has been already mentioned, with regard to the moon ; while that from eaft; to weft is in antecedence, or contrary to the order of the figns. Though all of them, however, revolve round the fun, their motions, as we have already obferved, are not in the fame plane, but inclined to one another by fmall angles: and the way in which we compute this inclination is by con- fidering the orbit of the earth as a ftandard, and cal¬ culating the angle which each of their orbits makes with it. ,tI To a fpe&ator placed in the fun, all the planets Heliocen- would appear to deferibe circles annually in the hea-ttic circles vens ; for though their motions are really elliptical,of the pi3"" the eccentricity is fo fmall, that the difference between nets* them and true circles is not eafily perceived even on earth ; and at the fun, whether great or fmall, it would entirely vanilh. Thefe circles, which in fuch a fitua- tion would appear to be annually deferibed among the fixed liars, are called the heliocentric circles cf the pla¬ nets ; and if we fuppofe the orbits of the planets to be extended to the extreme bounds of the creation, they would deferibe among the fixed ftars thofe circles juft mentioned. To a fpeftator in the fun, the comets, though moving in the moft eccentric orbits, would alfo appear to delcribe circles in the heavens : for though their orbits are in reality very long ellipfes, the planes of them extended to the heavens would mark a great circle thereon, whereof the eye would be the centre ; only, as the real motion is in an ellipfis, the body would appear to move much more flowly in fome part of the circle than another, and to differ exceffively in magnitude. To an inhabitant of any planet, how¬ ever, the fun appears to go round in its own heliocen¬ tric circle, or to deferibe in the heavens that fame curve which the planet would appear to do if feen from the fun. Thus (fig. 137), when the earth is at'rf, if we Eecliptic, why fo named",Jupiter,US,3,United States,North America
"For this reaion, whatever part of its orbit the earth may be in, the fixed (tars always appear to keep the fame place j but with refpedl to the planets, the orbit of the earth, or Magnus orlis, as it has fometim.es been called, bears a very ccniiderable proportion, excepting only to the Georgium Sidus, of whole diftance the dia¬ meter of the eartli’s orbit forms little more than a tenth part ; and therefore ali calculations with regard to that flar are muqh more difficult than the reft. The appa¬ rent places of the planets therefore are confiderably al¬ tered by the earth’s change of place as well as by their own motions ; fo that though a planet fhould ftand ftill for a whole year, it would neverthelefs appear to us to deferibe a: circle round the heavens, as in that fpace of time we would have been carried by the earth round the fun, and have continually taken a view of it from dif¬ ferent ftations. As the orbits of the planets are inclin¬ ed in different angles to the ecliptic, it thence happens, that the heliocentric latitude of any planet is almoll always different from its geocentric latitude. Thus, let AB, fig. 138. be the orbit of the earth, CD the orbit of Venus, viewed with the eye in their common ftdlion, wherein they appear ftraight lines ; let E and F be two oppofite points of the ecliptic ; and fuppofe Venus to be in the point C in her utmoft north limit. If fhe were at that time viewed from the fun S, fhe would appear in the point of the heavens marked H, and her heliocentric latitude is then FR : but if viewed from the earth in B, fhe will anpear at j-; at which time her heliocentric latitude is FH, and her geocentric only F jr.

"The following experiment will give a plain idea ofDiurnal the diurnal or annual motions of the earth, together n)otl6n with the different lengths of days and nights, and the beautiful variety of feafons, depending on thofe rent chan- motions. gesofthe Take about feven feet of ftrong wire, and bend it feafons, il- into a circular form, as a b e d, which being viewed ob- luftrated by liquely, appears elliptical, as in the figure. Place a lighted candle on a table j and having fixed one end of a lilk thread K to the north pole of a fmall terreftrial globe H, about three inches diameter, caufe another perfon to hold the wire circle, fo that it may be paral¬ lel to the table, and as high as the flame of the candle I, which fhould be in or near the centre. Then ha¬ ving twitted the thread as towards the left hand, that by untwifting it may turn the globe round eaftward, or contrary to the way that the bands of a watch move, hang the globe by the thread within this circle, al- moft contiguous to it; and as the thread untwifts, the globe (which is enlightened half round by the candle as the earth is by the fun) will turn round its axis, and the different places upon it will be carried through the light and dark hemifpheres, and have the appearance of a regular fucceffion of days and nights, as our earth has in reality by fuch a motion. As the globe turns, move your hand flowly, fo as to carry the globe round the candle according to the order of the letters abed, keeping its centre even with the wire circle; and you will perceive, that the candle, being ftill perpendicular to the equator, will enlighten the globe from pole to pole in its whole motion round the circle ; and that every place on the globe goes equally through the light and the dark, a$ it turns round by the untwift- 5i 8 ASTRO Particular ;ng 0f the thread, and therefore has a perpetual equi- Jf‘P“>n°x. The globe thus turning round reprefents the ^ial Phe. earth turning round its axis ; and the motion of the pomena. globe round the candle reprefents the earth’s annual V—y—J motion round the fun ; and fhows, that if the earth’s orbit had no inclination to its axis, all the days and nights of the year would be equally long, and there ■would be no different feafons. Hence alfo it appears why the planets Mars and Jupiter have a perpetual e- quinox, namely, becaufe their axis is perpendicular to the plane of their orbit, as the thread round which the globe turns in this experiment is perpendicular to the plane of the area inclofed by the wire.—But now de¬ fire the.perfon who holds the wire to hold it obliquely in the pofition ABCD, raifing the fide 25 juft as much as he depreffes the fide VJ, that the flame may be ftill in the plane of the circle ; and twilling the thread as before, that the globe may turn round its axis the fame ■way as you carry it round the candle, that is, from •weft to eaft ; let the globe down into the lowermoft part of the wire circle at : and if the circle be pro¬ perly inclined, the candle will fhine perpendicularly on the tropic of Cancer; and the frigid zone, lying within the arflic or north polar circle, will be all in the light, as in the figure ; and will keep in the light, let the globe turn round its axis ever fo often. From the equator to the north polar circle, all the places have longer days and fhorter nights ; but from the equator to the fouth polar circle, juft the reverfe. The fun does not fet to any part of the north frigid zone, as fhown by the candle’s fhining on it, fo that the motion of the globe can carry no place of that zone into the dark ; and at the fame time the fouth frigid zone is involved in darknefs,. and the turning of the globe brings none of its places into the light. If the earth were to continue in the like part of its orbit, the fun would never fet to the inhabitants of the north frigid zone, nor rife to thofe of the fouth. At the equator it would be always equal day and night; and as places are gradually more and more diftant from the equator towards the arftic circle, they would have longer days and fhorter nights ; whilft thofe on the fouth fide of the equator would have their nights longer than their days.

"The method ufed by Mr Fergufon to delineate the paths of thefe fatellites was the following.

Then taking a fmall cord of this length, and fixing one end of it to the floor of a long room by a nail, with a black-lead pencil at the other en'd, he drew the curve ABCD, See. and fet off a de¬ gree and half thereon from A to T ; becaufe Jupiter moves only fo much, whilft his outermoft fatellite goes once round him, and fomewhat more ; fo that this fmall portion of fo large a circle differs but very little from a ftraight line. This done, he divided the fpace AT in¬ to 18 equal parts, as AB, BC, &c. for the daily pro- grefs of Jupiter ; and each part into 24 for his hourly progrefs. The orbit of each fatellite was alfo divided into as many equal parts as the fatellite is hours in fi- niftiing its fynodical period round Jupiter. Then draw¬ ing a right line through the centre of the card, as a diameter to all the four orbits upon it, he put the card upon the line of Jupiter’s motion, and transferred it to every horary divifion thereon, keeping always the faid diameter-line on the line of Jupiter’s path ; and running a pin through each horary divifion in the or¬ bit of each fatellite as the card was gradually transfer¬ red along the line ABCD, &c. of Jupiter’s motion, -he marked points for every hour through the card for the curves defcribed by the fatellites, as the primary N O M Y.

The outermoft. of all is Saturn, his five moons, and his ring (N° fc.). Thefe moons are fupported and contrived fimilar to thofe of Jupiter. The machine is put into motion by turning a fmall winch (N° 14.) ; and the whole fyfiem is alfo moved by this winch, and by pull¬ ing out and pulhing in a fmall cylindrical pin above the hftfidle. When it is pulhed in,all the planets,both prima¬ ry and fecondary, will move according to their refpe&ive periods by rurning the handle.

(It is done by an auxiliary fmall fun and an earth, which change their places in the inftrument.) At the fame time, it affords a moft manifeft confuta¬ tion of it: for it is plainly obferved in this conftruc- tion, (1.) That the planets Mercury and Venus being both within the orbit of the fun, cannot at any time be feen to go behind it; whereas in nature we obferve them as often to go behind as before the fun in the heavens. (2.) It ftiows, that as the planets move in circular orbits about the central earth, they ought at all times to be-of the fame apparent magnitude; whereas, on the contrary, we ohferve their apparent magnitude in the heavens to be very variable, and fo far different, that, for inftance, Mars will fometimes appear as big as Jupiter nearly, and at other times you will fcarcely know him from a fixed flar.

On the human body the quantity of preffure fometimes varies near a whole tun; and when it is thus fo much diminiftied, moft people find fomething of a liftleflhefs and inactivity about them. It is furprifing, however, that the fpring of the internal fluid, already mentioned, which aCts as a counterpoife to the atmo¬ fpherical gravity, ftiould in all cafes feem to keep pace with it when the preffure is naturally diminiihed, and even when it is artificially augmented, though not when the preffure is artificially diminiflied. Thus in that kind of weather when the preffure of the air is leaft, wre never perceive our veins to fwell, or are fen- fible of any inward expanfion in our bodies. On the contrary, the circulation is languid, and we feem ra- I4 j ther to be oppreffed by a weight. Even in going up of difficul-j to the tops of mountains, where the preffure of the at- ty of refpi- mofphere is diminiftied more than three times what it ration on ufually is on the plain, no fuch appearances are ob- * ierved. Some travellers indeed have arhrmed, that, on the tops of very high mountains, the air is fo light as to occafion a great difficulty of refpiration, and even violent retching and vomiting of blood. It does not appear, however, that thefe affertions are well found¬ ed. Mr Brydone found no inconvenience of this kind on the top of mount iEtna; nor is any fuch thing men¬ tioned by Mr Houel, who alfo afcended this moun¬ tain. Sir William Hamilton indeed fays, that he did feel a difficulty of refpiration, independent of any ful- phureous fleam. But, on the top of a volcano, the refpiration may be affeCled by fo many different caufes, that it is perhaps impoffible to aflign the true one. The French mathematicians, when on the top of a very high peak of the Andes, did not make any complaint of this kind, though they lived there for fome time",Hamilton,"US,FR",3,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"“ Another particular obfervable on all the high places of the Cordilleras, and which depends on the fame eaufe, is, that when we leave the flrade, and ex- pofe ourfelves to the funlhine, we feel a much greater difference than we do here in our fine days when the weather is temperate. Every thing contributes at Quito to make the fun exceedingly powerful: a Angle ftep from an expofed place to the fhade gives the fen- fation of cold: this would not be the cafe if the quan¬ tity of heat acquired by the foil were more confider- able. We now alfo fee why the fame thermometer, put’firft into the lhade and then in the fun, does not undergo the fame changes at all times and in all pla¬ ces. In the morning, upon Pichincha, this inftrument is generally a few degrees below the freezing point* which may be reckoned the natural temperature of the place; but when during the day we expofe it to the fun, it is eafy to imagine that the effeft muft be great* and much more than double in whatever way it is mea- fured.” This theory is adopted by Mr Sauffure, who adds the following faft to prove that the aftion of the fun’s rays, cpnfidered abftraftedly and independent of any_ l9 ] extrinfic fource of cold, is as great on mountains as on £iafl-es g. ] plains; viz. that the power of burning lenfes and mir- qually rors is the fame at all heights. To afeertain this faft, powerful our author procured a burning-glafs fo weak that at “j? Geneva it would juft fet fire to tinder. This he car- ta;ns as oa , ried, with feme of the fame tinder, to the top of the plains, mountain Saleve (a height of 3000 feet) ; where it not only produced the fame effeft, but apparently with greater facility than on the plain. Being perfuaded then, that the principal fource of cold on the tops of high mountains is their being perpetually furrounded with an atmofphere which cannot be much heated ei¬ ther by the rays of the fun on account of its tranfpa¬ rency, or by the refleftion of them from the earth by reafon of its diftance, he wilhed to know, whether the direft folar rays on the top of a high mountain had the fame power as on the plain, while the body on which they afted was placed in fuch a manner as to be unaf- fefted by the furrounding air. For this purpofe he inflituted a fet of experiments, from which he drew the following conclufions, viz. that a difference of 777 toifes in height, diminilhes the heat which the rays of the fun are able to communicate to a body expofed to the ex¬ ternal air, 140 of the thermometer; that it diminiihes the heat of a body partially expofed, only 6°; and that it augments by 10 the heat of a third body completely defended from the air. 2e Hence it appears that the atmofphere, though fo Atmo- effentially neceffary to the fuppoi t of fire, is fome how ft-here eve- or other the greateft antagonift of heat, and moft ef- feftually counterafts the operation of. the folar rays in^e heat of producing it.

"From fome experiments made by M. Piftet, it appears, that ATM [ 619 ] ATM Mr Sex's exrcri- ments on this fub- that even in places expofed to the rays of the fun, the heat, at five feet diftance from the ground, is greater only by one or two degrees than at 50 feet above the furface, though the ground was at that time 15 or 20° warmer than the air immediately in cpntaft with it. Inconfide- ; rable as this difference is, however, it does not hold as . we go ' r up ; for if it did, the cold on the top of the mo . 11 of Saleve, which is 3000 feet above the level of the lake of Geneva, would be 6p° greater than at the foot of it; whereas in reality it is only io°. In the night-time the cafe is re.verfed ; for the ftratum of air, at five feet from the ground, was found by Mr Pic¬ tet to be colder than that at 50. Befides this, diffe¬ rent ftrata of the atmofphere are found to poffefs very different and variable degrees of cold, without any re¬ gard to their fituation high up or low down. In the year 1780, Dr Wilfon of Glafgow found a very re¬ markable cold exifting clofe to the furface of the ground; fo that the thermometer, when laid on the furface of the fnow, funk many degrees lower than one fufpend- ed 24 feet above it. It has been likewife obferved, that in clear weather, though the furface of the earth be then mofl liable to be heated by the fun, yet after that is fet, and during the night, the air is coldefl. near the ground, and particularly in the valleys. Experi¬ ments on this fubjeft were made for a whole year by Mr James Sex, who has given an account of them in the 78th volume of the Philofophical Tranfaftions. He fufpended thermometers (conltrufted in fuch a manner as to {how the true maximum and minimum of heat that might take place in the obferver’s abfence) in a fhady northerly afpeft, and at different heights in the open air. One of thefe was- placed of the height of 9 feet, and the other at that of 220 from the ground ; and the obfervations were continued, with only a few days omifiion, from July 178^. to July 1785",Geneva,US,3,United States,North America

At this period he was popular as preacher at the Rolls Chapel; an office which had been.conferred on him by Sir John Trevor, a great, difcerner of abilities, in 1698, when he refigned Bridewell, which he had obtained in 1693. Upon the acceffion of Queen Anne in 1702, Dr Atterbury was appointed one of her Majefty’s chaplains in ordinary ; and, in Oftober 1704, was ad¬ vanced to the deanery of Carlifle.

The proceedings continued above a week: and on Saturday May nth, the Biffiop was permitted to plead for himfelf. This he did in a very eloquent fpeech ; which he feelingly opens by com¬ plaining of the uncommon feverity he had experienced in the Tower ; which was carried to fo great a length, that not even his fon-in law Mr Morice was permitted to fpeak to him in any nearer mode than (landing in an open area, whilft the Biffiop looked out of a two- pair-of-ftairs window. In the courfe of his defence he obferves, “ Here is a plot of a year or two Handing, to fubvert the government with an armed force ; an invafion from abroad, an infurreftion at home: juft all to the malice and management of a great minifter when ripe for execution, it is difeovered; and twelve of Hate or two, who were refolved to remove him, on account of fome perfonal prejudices, as well as the conftant moleftation he gave them in parliament, and the particular influence and aftivity he had ffiown in the late eleftion. The friends to the miniftry, on the other hand, were ftrongly of opinion, that the Biffiop was fecretly a favourer of the Pretender’s caufe, and had formerly been tampering with things of that na¬ ture, even in the Queen’s time, and while his party was excluded from power; but upon their re-admif- fton, had relinquiffied that purfuit, and his confede- months after the contrivance of this fcheme, no con- fultation appears, no men correfponding together, no provifion made, no arms, no officers provided, not a man in arms ; and yet the poor Biffiop has done all this. What could tempt me to Hep thus out of my way ? Was it ambition, and a defire of climbing into a higher ftation in the church ? There is not a man in my office farther removed from this than I am. Was money my aim ? I always defpifed it too much, confidering what occafion I am now like to have for it: for out of a poor biffiopric of L.. 500 per annum, I have laid out rates therein, and became a good fubjeft again.

I have, my lords, ever finee •! knew what Popery was, oppofed it; and the better I knew it, the more I oppofed it. I began my ftudy in divi¬ nity, when the Popiih controverfy grew hot, with that immortal book of Tillotfon’s, when he undertook the Proteftant caufe in general; and as fuch, I efteem- ed him above all. You will pardon me, my lords, if I mention one thing : Thirty years ago, I writ in de¬ fence of Martin Luther; and have preached, exprelfed, and wrote to that purpofefrom my infancy; and what¬ ever happens to me, I will fuffer any thing, and, by God’s grace, burn at the flake, rather than depart from any material point of the Proteftant religion as profefled in the church of England. Once more : Can I be fuppofed to favour arbitrary power ? The whole tenor of my life has been otherwife: I was al¬ ways a friend to the liberty of the fubjeft; and, to the beil of my power, conftantly maintained it. I may have been thought miftaken in the meafures I took to fupport it ; but it matters not by what party I was called, fo my adlions are uniform.” Afterwards, fpeaking of the method of proceeding againft him as unconflitutional, he fays : “ My ruin is not of that moment to any number of men, to make it worth their while to violate, or even to feem to violate, the conftitution in any degree, which they ought to pre- ferve againft. any attempts whatfoever. Though I am worthy of no regard, though whatfoever is done to me may for that reafon be looked upon to be juft; yet your lordfhips will have fome regard to your ownTaft- ing intereft and that of pofterity. This is a proceed¬ ing with which the conftitution is unacquainted; which, under the pretence of fupporting it, will at laft effec¬ tually deftroy it.

There being folicited by the friends of the Pretender to enter into their negociations, he changed his abode for Montpelier in ryzS; and, after refiding there about two years, returned to Paris, where he died Feb. 15. 1731-2. The affliftion which he fuftained by the death of his daughter in 1729, was thought to have haftened his own difiblution. The former event he hath himfelf related in a very affe&ing manner, in a letter to Mr Pope : “ The earnelt defire of meeting one I dearly loved, called me abruptly to Montpelier; where, after continuing two months un¬ der the cruel torture of a fad and fruitlefs expe&ation, I was forced at lafi; to take a long journey to Touloufe; and even there I had miffed the perfon I fought, had fhe not, with great fpirit and courage, ventured all"" night up the Garonne to fee me, which fhe above all things defired to do before fhe died.

Four admirable “ Vifitation Charges” accompany his Epiftolary Correfpond- ence.” As to Bifhop Atterbury’s chara&er, however the moral and political part of it may have been different¬ ly reprefented by the oppofite parties, it is univerfally agreed, that he was a man of great learning and un¬ common abilities, a fine writer, and a moft excellent preacher. His learned friend Smalridge, in the fpeech he made when he prefented him to the Upper Houfo of Convocation, as prolocutor, ftyles him Vir in nullo literarum genere bofpes, in pierifque artibut et Jiudiis diu et feliciter exercitatus, in viaxime pcrfettn tion, and fo clumfily devifed (to fay the leaft of it, and liter arum difcliplinis per/eftifimur.

"It has been faid that Atterbury’s wifhes reached to the bifhopric of London, or even to York or Canter¬ bury.

The fojourners in Attica were under the fame law as thofe in Athens. As to fervants, they were freemen, who through indigency were driven to receive wages, and while they were in this ftate had no vote in the aflembly. As to flaves, they were abfo- lutely the property of their matters, and as fuch Were ufed as they thought fit. They were forbidden to wear clothes or to cut their hair like their matters ; and, which is indeed amazing, Solon prohibited them to love boys, as if that had been honourable. They were likewife debarred from anointing or perfuming them- felves, and from worfhipping certain deities. They were not allowed to be called by honourable names ; and in moft other refpefts were ufed like dogs.

"Of the judicatures for hearing civil caufes, the firft was the Parabajlcn; fo called, as fome think, becaufe in it no matter could be heard if the caufe of aftion was above one drachm.

The Trigonon was fo called becaufe it was triangular in its form. The court Metidius derived its appellation from the architeft who built it. The fixth and laft court was called Helieea. It was by far the greateft, and is generally conceived to have derived its name from the judges fitting in the open air expofed to the fun. All the Athenians who were free citizens were allowed by law to fit in thefe courts as judges; but before they took their feats were fworn by Apollo Patrius, Ceres, and Jupiter the king, that they would decide all things righteoufly and according to law, where there was any law to guide them ; and by the rules of natural equity, where there was none.

This is now afcertained by Mr For- pearances fter ; who in his late voyage round the world along in the with Captain Cook, affures us, that he obfcrved them fouthem in the high fouthern latitudes, though with phenome- na fomewhat different from thofe which are feen here. "" On Feb. 17. 1773, as they were in Lat. 580 fouth, “ a beautiful phenomenon (fays he) was obferved du¬ ring the preceding night, which appeared again this and fcveral following nights. It confided of long co¬ lumns of a clear white light, {hooting up from the ho¬ rizon to the eadward, almod to the zenith, and gra¬ dually fpreading on the whole fouthern part of the fky. Thefe columns were fometimes bent fidewiie at their upper extremities; and though in mod refpeds fimilar to the northern lights (aurora borealis) of our hemiiphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitifh colour, whereas ours affume various tints, e- fpecially thofe of a fiery and purple hue. The fky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air fharp and cold, the thermometer Handing at the freezing point.” Dr Halley obferved that the aurora borealis defcri-R;fcs4vcr? bed by him arofc to a prodigious height, it being fcen high, from the wed of Ireland to the confines of Ruffia and Poland on the ead; nor did he know hew much further it might have been vifibie ; fo that it extended at lead 30 degrees in longitude, and from lat. 50° north it was feen over all the northern part of Europe ; and what was very furprifing, in all thofe places where it was vi¬ fibie, the fame appearances were exhibited which Dr Halley obferved at London. He obferves, with feem- ing regret, that he could by no means-determine its height, for want of obfervations made at different pla¬ ces ; otherwifc he might as eafily have calculated the height of this aurora borealis as he did of the fiery globe in 1719*. To other philofophers, however, he t See gives the following exhortation. “When frherefore^,„/ * for the future any fueh thing fhall happen, all thofe ^ that are curious in allronomical matters are hereby admonijhed and intreated to fet their clocks to the apparent time at London, for example, by allowing fo many minutes as is the difference of meridians; and then to note, at the end of every half hour precifcly, the exaft fituation of what at that time appears remarkable in the iky; and particularly the azimuths of thofc very tall pyramids fo eminent above the red, and there¬ fore likely to be fcen furthed : to the intent that, by comparing thefe obfervations taken at the fame mo¬ ment in didant places, the difference of their azimuths may fcrve to determine how far thefe pyramids are di¬ dant from us.” This advice of Dr Halley feems to have been totally negletted by all the philofophical peo¬ ple in this country. In other countries, however, they A U R [ <594 1 A U R Aurora have been more induftrious. Father Bofcovich has , Borealis, determined the height of an aurora borealis, obferved on the 16th of December 1737 by the Marquis of Po- leni, to have been 825 miles high ; the celebrated Mr Bergman, from a mean of 30 computations, makes the average height of the aurora borealis to be 70 Swedifh, or upwards of 460 Englifh miles. Euler fuppofes it to be feveral thoufands of miles high ; and Mai- ran alfo affigns them a very elevated region. In the 74 th volume of the Philofophical Tranfaftions, Dr Blagden, when fpeaking of the height of fome fiery meteors, tells us, that the “ aurora borealis appears to occupy as high, if not a higher region above the fur- face of the earth, as may be judged from the very diftant countries to which it has been vifible at the fame time.” The height of thefe meteors, however, none of which appear to have exceeded or even ar¬ rived at the height of a hundred miles, muft appear trifling in comparifon of the vaft elevations above mentioned. But thefe enormous heights varying fo exceedingly, fhow that the calculators have not had proper data to proceed upon ; and indeed the im- menfe extent of fpace occupied by the aurora bo¬ realis itfelf, with its conftant motion, muft make it infinitely more difficult to determine the height of it than of a fiery globe, which occupies but a fmall por¬ tion of the vifible heavens. The moft certain method of making a comparifon betwixt the aurora borealis and the meteors already mentioned, would be, if a ball of fire fhould happen to pafs through the fame part of the heavens where an aurora borealis Was ; when the comparative height of both could eafily be afcertained","London, London, Aurora","GB,IE,PL,US",3,"United Kingdom,Ireland,Poland,United States","Europe,Europe,Europe,North America"

"The firft perfon that feems to have endeavoured to find any pofitive proof for the eledtrical quality of the aurora borealis is Dr Hamilton of Dublin. He ob- ferves, that though this phenomenon is commonly fup- pofed to be eledtrical, yet he had not feen any attempt to prove that it is fo : but the only proof he himfelf brings is an experiment of Mr Hawldbee, by which the eledtric fluid is ftiowm to put on appearances fome- what like the aurora borealis, w'hen it pafles through a vacuum. He obferved, that when the air was moft perfedlly exhaufted, the ftreams of eledlric matter were then quite white; but when a fmall quantity of air was let in, the light aflumed more of a purple colour",Dublin,US,3,United States,North America
"Was the aurora borealis the firft natural phenome¬ non the folution of which had been attempted by elec¬ tricity, no doubt the proofs juft now adduced would be very infufficient: but when it is confidered, that we A U R have indifputable evidence of the identity of the phe- Aurora nomena of thunder and of eledlricity; when we alfo Boreall9‘, confider, that the higher parts of our atmofphere are v continually in a ftrongly eledlrified ftate ; the analogy becomes fo ftrong,- that we can fcarce doubt of the au¬ rora borealis arifing from the fame caufe. The only difficulty is, to give a good reafon why the eledlricity of the atmofphere {hould be conftantly found to diredt its courfe from the poles towards the equator, and not from the equator to the poles; and this we think may be done in the following manner",Aurora,US,3,United States,North America
"terrible kind, immenfe quantities of the eledlric fluid aie thus communicated to the earth, and the inferior warm atmofphere having once exhaulled itfelf, muft ue- ceffarily [ 695 3 A U R r 696 ] A u R Aurora cefTanlj' be recruited from the upper and colder re- grfa 1S'. gion. This becomes very probable from what the French mathematicians obferved when on the top of one of the Andes. They were often involved in clouds, which, finking down into the warmer air, ap¬ peared there to be highly eleftrified, and difcharged themfelves in violent tempefls of thunder and light¬ ning ; while in the mean time, on the top of the mountain, they enjoyed a calm and ferene Iky. In the temperate and frigid zones, the inferior parts of the atmofphere never being fo ftrongly heated, do not part with their eledlricity fo eafily as in the torrid zone, and confequently do not require fuch recruits from the upper regions ; but notwithftanding the difference of heat obferved in different parts of the earth near the furface, it is very probable that at confiderable heights the degree of cold is nearly equal all round it. Were there a like equality in the heat of the under part, there could never be any confiderable lofs of equili- brium in the ele&ricity of the atmofphere : but as the hot air of the torrid zone is perpetually bringing down vaft. quantities of ele&ric matter from the cold air that lies direftly above it; and as the inferior parts of the atmofphere lying towards the north and fouth poles do not conduct in any great degree ; it thence follows, that the upper parts of the atmofphere lying oyer the torrid zone will continually require a fupply from the northern and fouthern regions. This eafily fhows the neceffity of an eledlric current in the upper parts of the atmofphere from each pole towards the equator : and thus we are ajfo furnilhed with a reafon why the au¬ rora borealis appears more frequently in winter than in fummer ; namely, becaufe at that time the electric power of the inferior atmofphere is greater on account of the cold than in fummer; and confequently the abundant ele&ricity of the upper regions muff go al- moft wholly oft' to the equatorial parts, it being impof- fible for it to get down to the earth : hence alfo the aurora borealis appears very frequent and bright in the frigid zones, the degree of cold in the u{)per and un¬ der regions of the atmofphere being much more nearly equal in thefe parts than in any other. ' In feme parts of Siberia particularly, this meteor appears conftantly from October to Chriilmas, and its corrufcations are faid to be very terrifying. Travellers agree, that here the aurora borealis appears in greateft perfe&ion ; and it is to be remarked, that Siberia is the coldelt coun¬ try on earth. In confirmation of this, it may alfo be obferved, that, from the experiments hitherto made with the ele&rical kite, the air appears confiderably more eledlrical in winter than in fummer, though the clouds are known to be often molt violently electrified in the fummer time; a proof that the eledtricity na¬ turally belonging, to the air is in fummer much more powerfully drawn off by the clouds than in the winter, owing to the excefs of heat in fummer, as already ob- krved",Aurora,"US,FR",3,"United States,France","North America,Europe"
"It now remains to explain only one particularity of the aurora borealis, namely, that its ftreams do not al¬ ways move with rapidity, fometimes appearing quite ftationary for a confiderable time, and fometimes being carried in different diredions with a flow motion. To this indeed we can give no other reply, than that weak eledric lights have been fometimes obferved to put on the fame appearance at the furface of the earth ; and much more may we fuppofe them capable of do¬ ing fo at great heights above it, where the conduc¬ tors are both fewer irr number and much more imper- fed. When M. de Romas was making experiments with an eledric kite in Italy, a cylinder of blue light about four or five inches diameter was obferved fur¬ rounding the firing. This was in the day-time ; but had it been night, he imagined it muft have been four or five feet in diameter; mid as the firing was 780 feet long, it would probably have feemed pyramidal, point¬ ing upwards like one of the ftreams of the aurora bo¬ realis. A ftill more remarkable appearance. Dr Prieft- ley tells us, was obferved by Mr Hartman. He had been making eledrical experiments for four or five hours together in a very fmall room; and upon going out of it, and returning with a light in his hand, walk¬ ing pretty quick, he perceived a fmall flame following him at about three feet diftanee. Being alarmed at this appearance, he flopped to examine it, upon which it vanilhed. This laft inftance is very remarkable, and fin* gular in its kind : from both, however, we are fuffici- ently warranted to conclude, that fmall portions of our atmofpheve may by various caufes be fo much eiedri- 5 A U R [ 697 ] A U R Aurora fied as to ftiine, and likewife be moved from one place Boreahr. tQ anot[ier without parting with the elettricity they have received, for a confideiable time",Aurora,"IT,US",3,"Italy,United States","Europe,North America"
"The hilling or rulhing noife above deferibed, Dr Elagden is inclined to attribute to fmall ftreams of elec¬ tric matter running off to the earth from the maffes or accumulations of eleftricity by which the northern lights are fuppofed to be produced. 6 We lhall conclude this article with an account of a Aurora bo- paper prefented to the Royal Society by Mr Winn, in realis fuc- 1772, wherein he fays that the appearance of an au-cee<led by rora borealis is a certain fign of an hard gale of wind^^^6 from the fouth or fouth-weft. This he never found to fail in 23 inftances; and even thinks, that from the fplendor of the meteor, fome judgment maybe formed concerning the enfuing tempeft. If the aurora is very bright, the gale will come on within twenty-four hours, but will be of no long duration ; if the light is faint and dull, the gale will be lefs violent, and longer in coming on, but wull alfo laft longer. His obfervations were made in the Englilh channel, where fuch winds are very dangerous; and by attending to the auroras, he fays he often got eafily out of it, when others nar¬ rowly efcaped being wrecked. This is an exceeding ufeful obfervation for failors: but it cannot be expefted that the winds fucceeding thefe meteors Ihould in all places blow from the fouth-weft ; though no doubt a careful obfervation of what winds fucceed the aurora borealis, and other meteors, in different parts of the world, might contribute in fome meafure to leffen the dangers of navigation. 7 That the aurora borealis ought to be fucceeded by Conjecture winds, may be eafily deduced from the hypothefis r^afoi? mentioned. If this phenomenon is occafioned by the vaft quantity of eledtric matter conveyed to the equa¬ torial parts of the earth, it is certain that the earth cannot receive any great quantity of this matter at one place without emitting it at another. The eleftricity, therefore, which is conftantly received at the equator, mufl be emitted neater the poles, in order to perform its courfe, otherwife there could not be a conftant fup- ply of it for the common operations of nature. It is obferved, that eledtrified bodies are always furrounded by a blaft of air, which is fent forth from them in all diredlions; hence, if the eledlric matter find a more, ready paffage through one part of the earth than ano¬ ther, a wind will be found to blow from that quarter",Aurora,US,3,United States,North America

"The learned'are in great doubt about the time when baking fir ft became a particular profeffion and bakers were introduced. It is however generally agreed, that they had their rife in the eaft, and paffed from Greece to Italy after the war with Pyrrhus, about the year of Rome 583. Till which time every houfewife was her own baker ; for the vi or & ptjlor, which we find in Ro¬ man authors before that time, fignified a perfon who ground or pounded the grain in a mill or mortar to prepare it for baking, as Varro obferves. According to Athenteus, the Cappadocians were the mod ap¬ plauded bakers, after them the Lydians, then the Phoenicians.—To the foreign bakers brought into Rome, were added a number of freed-men, who were incorporated into a body, or, as they called it, a college : from which neither they nor their children were allowed to withdraw. They held their effe&s in common, and could not difpofe of any part ©f them. Each bake- houfe had a patronus, who had the fuperintendency thereof; and thefe patroni ele&ed one out of their number each year, who had fuperintendence over all the reft, and the care of the college. Out of the body -of the bakers were every now and then one admitted among the fenators.—To preferve honour and honefty in the college of bakers, they were exprefsly prohibited all alliance with comedians and gladiators; each had his ftiop or bake-houfe, and they were diftributed into fourteen regions of the city. They were excufed from guardianlhips and other offices, which might divert them from their employment.— By our own ftatutes bakers are declared not to be handicrafts.

It would lead us too far to enter more minutely into the defcription of this aftonilhing edifice. The lovers of the arts will find it defcribed with the greateft truth and accuracy in a work publifhed at London in 1757, under the title of Ruins of Balbec. This work, compiled by Mr Ro¬ bert Wood, the world owes to the attention and libe¬ rality of Mr Daw'kins, who in 1751 vifited Balbec and Palmyra. But feveral changes, however, have taken place fince their journey : for example, they found nine large columns (landing; and in 17S4 Mr Volney found but fix. They reckoned 29 at the lefler temple ; but there now remain but 20 ; the others have been overthrown by the earthquake of 1759. It has likewife fo (haken the walls of the leffer temple, that the done of the foffit, or croft (lone at the top of the gate, has (lid between the two adjoining ones, and de- of their refearches, added to the opprefiions and ex-' tortions of the governors, who have made their fup- pofed difcoveries a pretext, have at length difiieartened them ; but they imagine the Europeans would be more fuccefsful; nor would it be pofiible to perfuade them but what we are pofieffed of the magic art of deftroy- ing talifmans. It is in vain to oppofe reafon to igno* ranee and prejudice : and it would be no left ridicu¬ lous to attempt to prove to them, that Solomon never was acquainted with the Corinthian order* which was only in ufe under the Roman emperors. But their tradition on the fubjeft of this prince may fugged three important obfervations. Firft, That all tradition re¬ lative to high antiquity is as falfe arpong the Orientals as the Europeans. With them, as with us, fadts which happened 100 years before, when not preferred in wri¬ ting, are altered, mutilated, or forgotten. To expedb information from them with refp'edl to events in the time of Davitl or Alexander, would be as abfurdas to make inquiries of the Flemilh peafants concerning Clo- Charlemagne. Secondly, That throughout Sy- feended eight inches; by which means the body of ria, the Mahometans, as well as the Jews and Chridians, the bird fculptured on that done is fufpended detached from its wings and the two garlands which hung from its beak, and terminated in two genii Nature alone has not effected this devadation ; the Turks have had their (hare in the dedrudlion of the columns. Their motive is to procure the iron cramps, which ferve to join the feveral blocks of which each column is com- pofed. Thefe Cramps anfwer fo well the end intend- attribute every great work to Solomon : not that the memory of him dill remains by tradition in thofe coun¬ tries, but from certain paffages in the Old Tedament; which, with the gofpel, is thefource of almod all their tradition, as thefe are the only hidorical books read or known ; but as their expounders are very ignorant, their applications of what they are told are generally very remote from truth : by an error of this kind, they ed, that feveral of the columns are not even disjointed pretend Balbec is the houfe of the forejl of Lebanon built by their fall; one, among others, as Mr Wood ob- ferves, has penetrated a done of the temple wall with¬ out giving way ; nothing can furpafs the workmanfhip of thefe columns ; they are joined without any cement, yet there is not room for the blade of a knife between their interdices. After fo many ages, they in gene¬ ral (HU retain their original whitenefs. But what is dill more adonifhing, is the enormous (tones which compofe the (loping wall., To the wed the fecond layer is formed of dones which are from 28 to 35 feet by Solomon ; nor do they approach nearer probability when they attribute to that king the well of Tyre and the buildings of Palmyra. Thirdly, That the belief in hidden treafures has been confirmed by difcoveries which have been really made from tirrv e. It is not many years fince a fmall coffer wa>, fo at He¬ bron full of gold and filver medals, with an ancient Arabic book on medicine. In the country of the Druzes, an individual difeovered likewife, fome time fince, ajar with gold coin in the form of a crefcent; long, by about nine in height. Over this layer, at but as the chiefs and governors claim a right to thefe the north wed angle, there are three (tones, which difcoveries, and ruin thofe who have made them, under alone, occupy a fpace of 175! feet; viz. the firft 58 pretext of obliging them to make reftoration, thofe who feet feven inches exactly 58 feet; the fecond 58 feet 11 ; and the third find any thing endeavour carefully to conceal it; they nd each of thefe are 12 feet thick, fecretly melt the antique coins, nay, frequently bury Thefe ftones are of a white granite, with large (hining them again in the fame place where they found them, flakes like gypfe ; there is a quarry of this kind of from the fame fears which caufed their firft concealment","Jupiter, London, Roman, Tyre","LB,US,GB,RO",3,"Lebanon,United States,United Kingdom,Romania","Asia,North America,Europe,Europe"
"When we confider the extraordinary magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be aftonilhed at the filence of the Greek and Roman authors. Mr Wood, who has carefully examined all the ancient wri¬ ters, has found no mention of it, except in a fragment of John of Antioch, who attributes the conftru&ioa of this edifice to Antoninus Pips. The inferiptions of explaining it, by fuppofing thefe edifices to have which remain corroborate this opinion, which perfedt- been conftnnSted by Djenoun, or genii, who obeyed 1 c —a-—- ~r- -r il-~ /~i-— the orders of King Solomon ; adding, that the motive -of fuch immenfe works was to conceal in fubterraneous caverns vaft treafures, which (till remain there. To difeover thefe, many have defeended into the vaults Vol. II. Part II, ly accounts for the conftant ufe of the Corinthian or¬ der, fince that order was not in general ufe before the third age of Rome ; but we ought by no means to al¬ lege as an additional proof the bird fculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and 5 D the B A L [76 Balbec the caduceus he bears, give him the appearance of an H eagle, the tuft of feathers on his head, like that of _ US’ .certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman eagle : ~ befides that the fame bird is found in the temple of Palmyra; and is therefore evidently an oriental eagle, confecrated to the fun, who was the divinity adored in both thefe temples. His worfhip exifted at Balbec in the moft remote antiquity. His ftatue, which rcfem- bled that of Ofiris, had been tranfported there from the Heliopolis of Egypt, and the ceremonies with which he was worlhipped there have been defcribed by Mac- robius, in his curious work intitled Saturnalia. Mr Wood fuppofes with reafon, that the name of Balbec, which in Syriac fignifies City of Bal, or of the fun, o- riginated in this worfhip. The Greeks, by naming it Heliopolis, have in this indance only given a literal tranflation of the oriental word; a pra&ice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the date of this city in remote antiquity ; but it is to be prefumed, that its fituation, on the road from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it fome part of the commerce of thefe opulent capitals. Under the Romans, in the time of Auguftus, it is mentioned as a garrifon-town; and there is ftill remaining, on the wall of the fouthern gate, on the right as we enter, an infcription which proves the truth of this, the words kenturia prima, in Greek charafters, being very legible. One hundred and forty years after, Antoninus built there the pre- fent temple, inftead of the ancient one, which was doubtlefs falling into ruins : but Chriftianity having gained the afcendency under Conftantine, the modern temple was negle&ed, and afterwards converted into a church ; a wall of which is now remaining, that hid the fanftuary of the idols. It continued thus until the invafion of the Arabs, when it is probable they envied the Chriftians fo beautiful a building. The church be¬ ing lefs frequented, fell to decay ; wars fucceeded ; and it was converted into a place of defence ; battlements were built on the wall which furrounded it, on the pa¬ vilions, and at the angles, which ftill fubfift; and from that time, the temple, expofed to the fate of war, fell rapidly to ruin. The ftate of the city is not lefs de¬ plorable. The wretched government of the emirs of the houfe of Harfoufhe had already greatly impaired it; and the earthquake of 1759 completed its de- ftruftion. The wars of the Emir Youfef and Djezzar have rendered it ftill more defected and ruinous. Of 5000 inhabitants, at which number they were eftima- ted in 1751, not 1200 are now remaining; and all thefe poor, without induftry or commerce, and culti¬ vating nothing but a little cotton, fome maize, and water-melons","Roman, Antioch, Rome, Roman, Tyre, Of","RO,US,GR,EG,LB,TR",3,"Romania,United States,Greece,Egypt,Lebanon,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa,Asia,Asia"

Several fine portraits of his hand are at the Hague ; among which there is one ad¬ orned with allegorical figures of Wifdom and Juftice, which extorts commendation from all who attentively confider it.

In the apoftolical age, and fome time baptifm, in perfons who had been admitted to munion, on a prefumption of their being duly bap¬ tifed, though the contrary afterwards appeared. For infants dying without baptifm, the cafe was thought more dangerous : as here, no perfonal faith, repen¬ tance, or the like, could be pleaded, to fupply the de- feft, and wafli away original fin : on this account, they who fpoke moft favourably of them, as Greg.

Pelagias, and his after, before churches and baptifteries were generally followers, who denied original fin, afferted, that they erected, they baptized in any place where they had might be admitted to eternal life and falvation, though convenience; as John baptized in Jordan, and Philip not to the kingdom of heaven ; between which they baptized the eunuch in the wildernefs, and Paul the diftinguilhed.
