He wrote alfo to the fenate, defiring them to aft with indulgence rather than feverity ; not to Ihed the blood of any fenator or peifion of quality, or of any other perfon whatfoever, but to allow this ho¬ nour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had loft their lives, except in the firft heat of the tumult. In 176, Antoninus vifited Syria and Egypt: the kings of thofe countries, and ambaf- fadors alio from Parthia, came to vifit him. He (laid feveral days at Smyrna ; and, after he had fettled the •affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his fon Commodus, whom he chofe conful for the year fol¬ lowing, though he was then but 16 years of age, ha¬ ving obtained a difpenfation for that purpofe. On the 27th of September, the fame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commodus, ©n account of the viftories gained over the Germans. Dion Caflius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to himfelf and the public treafury during 46 years, from the time that Hadrian had granted the fame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to thofe debts. He applied himfelf likewife to correft many enormities, and introduced feveral excellent regulations.

They were here firft initiated in the myfteries, and were religioufly inveft- ed ; after which, they were permitted to bear the yoke of God, through a town to a place called the Sanfluary, the entrance of which was prohibited to the profane",,EG,3,Egypt,Africa
"There they were obliged to fwear that they would nei¬ ther infert months nor days in the year, and thdt it ftiould remain compofed of 365 days, as had been efta- bliihed by the ancients.”—From thefe faefts Mr Sava- ry, in his letters on Egypt, infers, that Apis was the tutelary divinity of the new form given to the folar year, and of the cycle of 25 years, difeovered at the fame time. This deity, befides, had a marked rela¬ tion to the fwelling of the Nile, as is teitified by a great number of hiftorians. The new moon which followed the fummer folftice, was the aera of this phenomenon, on which the eyes of every body were fixed: And Pliny fpeaks as follows on this fubjedl: “ Apis had on his right fide a white mark, reprefenting the crefeent: This mark (continues ifdian) indicated the commence¬ ment of the inundation.” If Apis poffeffed the cha- rafteriftic figns which proved his divine origin, he promifed fertility and abundance of die fruits of the earth. It feems demonftrated, therefore, Mr Savary adds, that this facred bull, the guardian of the folar year of 365 days, was alfo regarded as the genius who prefided over the overflowing of the river. The priefts, by fixing the courfe of his life to 25 years, and by ma¬ king the inftallation of a new Apis, concur with the renewal of the period above mentioned, had probably perceived, as the refult of long meteorological obferva- tions, that this revolution always brought about abun¬ dant feafons. Nothing was better calculated to pro¬ cure a favourable reception of this emblematical deity from the people, fince his birth was a prefage to them of a happy inundation, and of all the treafures of teem- ingnature",,EG,3,Egypt,Africa
"The folemnity of this inauguration was called Appa¬ rition. That which was renewed every year towards- the 12th or 13th of the month Payn, which corre- fponds with the 17th or 18th of June, was called the birth of Apis.

"Whether Apollo was ever a real perfonage, or only the great luminary, many have doubted. Indeed, Vof- iius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a metaphorical being, and that there never was any o- ther Apollo than the fun. “ He was ftyled the fon of Jupiter (fays this author), becaufe that god was rec¬ koned by the ancients the author of the world. His mother was called Latona, a name which fignifies hid¬ den ; becaufe, before the fun was created, all things were wrapped up in the obfcurity of chaos. He is always reprefented as beardlefs and youthful, becaufe the fun never grows old or decays. And what elfe can his bow and arrows imply, but his piercing beams ?” And adds, “ that all the ceremonies which were performed to his honour, had a manifeft relation to the great fource of light which he reprefented. Whence (he concludes) it is vain to feek for any other divinity than the fun, which was adored under the name of Apdlfe.'” However, though this be in general trye, yet it does appear, from many paffages in ancient authors, that there was fome illuftrious perfonage named 4polle,who, after his apotheofis, was taken for the fun; as Ofiris and Orus in Egypt, whofe exiftence cannot be called in <jueftion, were, after their death, confounded with the fun, of which they became the fymbols, either from the glory and fplendor of their reigns, or from a belief that their fouls had taken up their refidence in that luminary",Jupiter,"EG,US",3,"Egypt,United States","Africa,North America"

"It is eafy to trace almoft all the Grecian fables and mythologies from Egypt.

If the Greek Apollo was reckoned the god of eloquence, mu- fic, medicine, and poetry, the reafon was, that Oliris, who was the fymbol of the fun among the Egyptians, as well as his fon Orus, had there taught thofe liberal arts. If the Greek Apollo was the god and conduc¬ tor of the mufes, it was becaufe Ofiris carried with him in his expedition to the Indies finging women and mu- ficians.

This was obferved by the Greeks, who im¬ proved upon the proportions formerly ufed, and were the inventors of three of the five orders of architecture, 8 viz. the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. “ Anciently And of pro-(fays Vitruvius) they were ignorant of the art of pro¬ portioning portioning the various parts of a building: they ufed columns. cojurnns ., km they cut them at hazard, without rules, without principles, and without having any attention to the proportions which they ought to give them : they placed them likewife without any regard to the other parts of the edifice.

"Such is the account given by Vitruvius of the origin of improvements in the proportion of columns. Had E C T U It E. 219 thefe improvements, however, exifted in fuch early times, Homer, who -was greatly pofterior to them, would certainly have made mention of fomething of that kind; but in all his writings he gives us no account of any thing like columns of ftone, but ufes a word which would rather incline us to think that his columns were' nothing more than bare polls. IT It is remarkable, that improvements in architedlure Hintsofim- did not take place in any nation till after, or about, theprovement time that Jerufalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar. ProbabIy The grandeft buildings eredled among the A fi yrians feemto have owed their exiftence to this monarch; andt°,np'0^ it can fcarce be imagined that he would not endeavour to imitate the architedlure of Solomons temple, to which, by his conqueft of Jerufalem, he had full ac- cefs.—It is alfo remarkable, that the dimenfions of the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, fet up by Solomon, very nearly correfpcnd with thofe of the Doric order, firft invented by the Greeks, and which Originally came from their colonies fettled in Afia Minor. The height of Solomon’s pillars, without the chapiter, was 18 cu¬ bits ; that of the chapiter itfelf was five cubits ; the circumference was 12 cubits ; from whence, according to the Scripture language, we may reckon the diame¬ ter to have been exadlly four cubits.’ Had they been a Angle cubit higher, they would have been precifely of the fame height with columns of the original Doric order. We do not indeed mean to afiert, that this fa¬ mous temple gave a model of architedlure to the whole world ; although it is fcarce conceivable but imitations - of it, as far -as it could be known, muft have taken place among many nations. 1 j - Notwithftanding all their defedts, however, the E-Egyptian gyptian buildings undoubtedly had an air of vaft gran-ban(iuetir‘S- deur and magnificence, if we may credit the defcription given of one of their banqueting-rooms- by Vitruvius.” 6 The ufual fize of one of thefe rooms was from 100 to r 5© feet in length, and its breadth fomewhat more than half its length. At the upper end, and along the two fides, they placed rows of pillars tolerably well proportioned to one another, though net of any regu¬ lar order ; and at the lower part they made a magnifi¬ cent and Ipacious1 entrance : this, with its ornaments, feems to have taken up one end of the building entire",,EG,3,Egypt,Africa

In this way M. Goguet remarkably diftinguifhes himfelf; and that without giving any reafon at all, but merely that he takes it into his head. Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effect, that the walls of Babylon could have been sr8 feet high and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhow us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it muft contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms ; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiftorians, this .immenfe mafs of building was finilhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchadnezzar, or whoever ■fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for 10 years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as ftrongly as it is faid to have been ; for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly .fo, amounting to 18,189,’600 folid fathoms. When onr author afterwards gafeonades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power-, tale, and time, to finilh Verfailles, •with all its defedls, than to conftnnft a pyramid, or e- red an obeliflt.” The genius, tafte, and time, we .fliall not difpute ; but as the fame author confeffes that J 00)000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftrudion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time -the ahovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fomc of the works of which M. Goguet •boafts fo much.

"Dr Bryant, however, rejedts the hiftory of the Ar¬ gonautic expedition as a Grecian fable, founded indeed on a tradition derived from Egypt, and ultimately re¬ ferring to Noah’s prefervation, &c. in the ark. But although.we are not to believe all the romantic ftories which poets, and even fome grave hiftorians, have told us of thofe famous adventurers, yet it feems unreafon- able to diferedit entirely the Argonautic expedition",,EG,3,Egypt,Africa
"The occafion of this expedition is thus reprelented by Greek writers. Phryxus, flying with his fifttr Helle from the rage of their flep-mother Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, went on board a fliip, whole en- fign was a golden ram, and failed to Colchis (now, Mingrelia, part of Georgia). Helle was drowned by the way, in that fea which from her was called the Hellefpont, now the Dardanelles. This, according to fome, was the ground of the poetical fable, that a ram with a golden fleece fwam away with them to Colchis j and that the Argonauts undertook their famed expe¬ dition, in order to find that fleece. But Strabo and Arrian informs us, that it was a practice of the Col- chians to colledf gold on mount Caucafus by ex¬ tending fleeces acrofs the beds of the torrents 5 and as the water pafled, the metallic particles remain¬ ed entangled in the wool : hence"", according to thofe hiftorians, the adventure was named the expedition of the golden fleece. Sir Ifaac Newton thinks that this expedition was really an embaffy fent by the Greeks, during the inteftine divifions of Egypt in the reign of Amenophis, to perfuade the nations upon the coafts of the Euxine and Mediterranean feas, to take that op¬ portunity of fliaking off the yoke of Egypt, which Se- foftris had laid upon them ; and that fetching the gol¬ den fleece, was only , a pretence to cover their true defign","Ino, Newton","EG,GE,JP,US,GR",3,"Egypt,Georgia,Japan,United States,Greece","Africa,Asia,Asia,North America,Europe"

Mathematics feem to be declining in Britain j the great Newton, having furpafled all the ancients, has not left to the moderns even the fainteft hope of equalling him ; and what man will enter the lilts who defpairs of viefory ? In a country thinly peopled, where even neceflary arts want, hands, it is common to fee one perfon ex- ercifing more arts than one : in feveral parts of Scot¬ land, one man ferves as a phyfician, furgeon, and apo¬ thecary. In every populous count ry, even Ample arts are fplitinto parts, and each part has an artift appro¬ priated to it. In the large towns of ancient Egypt, a phyfician was confined to a Angle difeafe. In me¬ chanic arts that method is excellent. As a hand con¬ fined to a Angle operation becomes both expert and ex¬ peditious, a mechanic art is perfected by having its dif¬ ferent operations dillributed among the greateft num¬ ber of hands : many hands are employed in making a watch, and a ftill greater number in manufacturing a web of woollen cloth. Various arts or op erations car¬ ried on by the fame man, envigorate his mind, becaufe they exercife different faculties j and as he cannot be equally expert in every art or operation, he is fre¬ quently reduced to fupply want of (kill by thought and invention.

There are feveral kinds of Jews pitch in the Afphode- (hops : but none of them are the genuine fort, and have , 118 little other title to their name than their being artifi- “‘v’” dally compounded by Jews ; and as they are a medley of we know not what ingredients, their medicinal ule begins to be defervedly laid afide, notwithdanding the dii'catient, refolvent, pectoral, and other virtues, attri¬ buted to this bitumen by the ancients. The true af- phaltum was formerly uled in embalming the bodies of the dead. The thick and folid afphalta are at prefent employed in Egypt, Arabia, and Perfia, as pitch for (hips ; as the fluid ones, for burning in lamps, and for varnilhes. Some writers relate, that the walls of Ba¬ bylon, and the temple of Jerufalem, were cemented with bitumen inftead of mortar. This much is cer¬ tain, that a true natural bitumen, that for inftance which is found in the diflrid of Neufch&rel, proves an excellent cement for walls, pavements, and other pur- pofes, uncommonly firm, very durable in the air, and not penetrable by water.

He was the firft who introduced geometry into the fcience, and he is fuppofed to be the inventor of many propofitions attributed to Euclid. Having travelled into Egypt in the earlier part of his life, and obtained a recom¬ mendation from Agefilaus to Nedianebus king of Egypt, he, by his means, got accefs to the priefts, who had the knowledge of aftronomy entirely among them, after which he taught in Afia and Italy.

But about this time, or rather earlier, the Greeks having begun to plant colonies in Italy, Gaul, and Egypt, thefe became acquainted with the Pythagorean fyftem, and ahe notions of the ancient Druids concerning aftronomy.

The earth is Ihown to be a planet in eireum-^^*^^ ftances very fimilar to the other five: we know 'ts tjje pianets: final caufe—to fupport a number of inhabitants : And by analogy we may conclude, that the others are alfo habitable worlds ; though, from their different pro¬ portions of heat, it is credible that beings of our make and temperature could not live upon them. However, even that can fcarcely be affirmed of all the planets; for the warmelt climate on the planet Mars is not colder than many parts of Norway or Lapland are in the fpring or autumn. Jupiter, Saturn, and the Geor¬ gium Sidus, it muft be granted, are colder than any of the inhabited parts of our globe. The greateit heat on the planet Venus exceeds the heat on the ifland of St Thomas on the coaft of Guinea, or Sumatra in the Eaft Indies, about as much as the heat in thofe places exceeds that of the Orkney iflands, or the city of Stockholm in Sweden : therefore, at 6o° north latitude on that planet, if its axis were perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the heat would not exceed the greateft heat on the earth ; and of courfe vegeta¬ tion like ours might be there carried on, and animals of the fpecies on earth might fubfift.

The power by which the moon is influenced dits of the j^g keen a]rea(jy fhown to be the fame with that which Planets. we ca^ gravity. Now, one of the effects of the prin- ciple of gravity is, that all bodies defcend by this force 303 from equal heights in equal times. This was taken Properties notice of long ago ; and particular methods have been of gravity invented to fhow, that the only caufe why fome bo- tedTh^en ^'£8 weie °bferved to fall in a fliorter time than others c3ninmoPCn was the refiftance of the air. As thefe methods, how¬ ever, have been found liable to fome uncertainty, Sir Ifaac'Newton had recourfe to experiments made on pendulums. Thefe vibrate by the fame power which makes heavy bodies fall to the ground ; but if the ball ©f any pendulum of the fame length with another were more or lefs attra&ed in proportion to the quantity of folid matter it contains, that pendulum mutt then vi¬ brate fafter or flower than the other. Now the vibra¬ tions of pendulums continue for a long time, and the number of vibrations they make may be eafily deter¬ mined without any fufpicion of error 5 fo that this ex¬ periment may be extended to what exadtnefs we pleafe : and Sir Ifaac affures us, that he examined in this way feveral fubftances, as gold, filver, lead, glafs, fand, common fait, wood, water, and wheat ; in all which he found not the leafl; deviation from the theory, tho* he made the experiment in fuch a manner, that in bo¬ dies of the fame weight, a difference in the quantity of their matter lefs than the thoufandth part of the whole ■would have difcovered itfelf. It appears, therefore, that all bodies are made to defcend here by the power of gravity with the fame degree of fwiftnefs. This de- icent has already been determined at 16-J- feet in a fe- cond from the beginning of their fall. It has alfo been obferved, that if any terreftrial body could be convey¬ ed as high up as the moon, it would defcend with the very fame degree of velocity with which the moon is attrafted toward the earth 5 and therefore that the power of the earth upon the moon bears the fame pro¬ portion it would have upon thofe bodies at the fame ^04 diftance as the quantity of matter in the moon bears Attrattion t0 t^ie quantity in thofe bodies. Thus the affertion is proportion-proved in the earth, that its power on every body it «d to the attracts is, at the fame diftance from the earth, propor- quantity of tjonaj t0 ^ qUant;ty of folid matter in the body afted a el'1 upon. As to the fun, it has been fhown, that the power of his adtion upon the fame primary planet is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion ofiits diftance ; and that the power of the fun decreafes throughout in the fame proportion, is teftified by the motion of the planets traverfing the whole planetary region. This proves, that if any planet were removed from the fun to any diftance whatever, the degree of its acceleration towards the fun vvould yet be reciprocally in the dupli¬ cate proportion o'f their diftance. But it has already been proved, that the degree of acceleration given to the planets by the fun is reciprocally in the duplicate pro¬ portion of their refpe&ive diftances ; all which, compa¬ red together, puts it out cf doubt, that the power of the fun upon any planet removed into the place of any other, would give it the fame velocity of defcent as it gives that other 5 and confequently that the fun’s ac¬ tion upon different planets at the fame diftance would be proportionable to the quantity cf matter in each.

We are aflured, however, by Dr Shaw, that the part of this chain of mountains which fell under his obfervation could not Hand in competition either with the Alps or Apennines. He tells us, that if we conceive a number of hills, ufually of the perpendicular height of 400, 500, or 600 yards, with an eafy afcent, and feveral groves-of fruit or fo- re/l trees, riling up in a fucceflion of ranges above one another; and that if to this profpeA we add now and then a rocky precipice, and on the fummit of each ima¬ gine a miferable mud-walled village; we /hall then have a juft idea of the mountains of Atlas.! According to M. Chenier*, this mountain is form- * IJjfl. of ed by an endlefs chain of lofty eminences, divided into Morocco, differeSt countries, inhabited by a multitude of tribes, I3* whofe ferocity permits no ftranger to approach. “ I have not been able (continues he) to obtain a fu/Scient knowledge of thefe mountains to defcribe them accu¬ rately : What Leo Africanus has faid of them is very vague; and his account is the lefs to be regarded at prefent, as it is now about three centuries fince he wrote, and the face of the country has been in that time totally changed.

The Greeks, by naming it Heliopolis, have in this indance only given a literal tranflation of the oriental word; a pra&ice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the date of this city in remote antiquity ; but it is to be prefumed, that its fituation, on the road from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it fome part of the commerce of thefe opulent capitals. Under the Romans, in the time of Auguftus, it is mentioned as a garrifon-town; and there is ftill remaining, on the wall of the fouthern gate, on the right as we enter, an infcription which proves the truth of this, the words kenturia prima, in Greek charafters, being very legible. One hundred and forty years after, Antoninus built there the pre- fent temple, inftead of the ancient one, which was doubtlefs falling into ruins : but Chriftianity having gained the afcendency under Conftantine, the modern temple was negle&ed, and afterwards converted into a church ; a wall of which is now remaining, that hid the fanftuary of the idols. It continued thus until the invafion of the Arabs, when it is probable they envied the Chriftians fo beautiful a building. The church be¬ ing lefs frequented, fell to decay ; wars fucceeded ; and it was converted into a place of defence ; battlements were built on the wall which furrounded it, on the pa¬ vilions, and at the angles, which ftill fubfift; and from that time, the temple, expofed to the fate of war, fell rapidly to ruin. The ftate of the city is not lefs de¬ plorable. The wretched government of the emirs of the houfe of Harfoufhe had already greatly impaired it; and the earthquake of 1759 completed its de- ftruftion.
