Were he to give a hi¬ ftory of his thoughts, and of the manner in which he received impreffions, he might give fome fuch in¬ formation as this. I remember the moment when my exiftence commenced. It was a moment replete with joy, with amazement and anxiety. I neither knew what I was, where I was, nor whence I came. I opened my eyes. But what an amazing increafe offenfation! The light, the celeftial vault, the verdure of the earth, the tranfparency of the waters, gave animation to my fpirits, and conveyed pleafures which exceed the powers of expreflion. At firft I believed that all thefc objects exifted within me, and formed a part of my- felf. When, turning mine eyes to the fun, his fplen- dor overpowered me. I voluntarily Ihut out the light, and felt a fmall degree of pain. During this mopient of darknefs, l imagined that I had loft the greateft part of my being. I was then roufed with a variety of founds. The finging of birds and the murmuring breezes formed a concert, which excited the moft fweet and inchanting emotions. I liftened, and was convinced that thefe harmonious founds exifted within me.—I made a ftep forwards ; and afterwards renewing my motion, I walked with my face turned towards ANT [ 63 ] ANT AnteJilu* towards the Heavens; till 1 ftruck againfl a palm-tree, vians. and felt fome degree of pain. Seized with terror, I ventured to lay my hand upon the objeft, and per¬ ceived it to be a being diftinft from myfelf, becaufe it did not, like touching my own body, give me a double ' fenfation. I refolvcd then to feel every objeft I faw, and had a ftrong defire to touch the fun ; but ftretch- ing out my hands to embrace the Heavens, they met without any intermediate objeA. All obje&s appear¬ ed to me equally near ; and it was not till after many trials that I learned to ufe my eye as a guide to my hand. At laft the train of my ideas was interrupted, and I loft the confcioufnefs of myexiftence. My deep was profound ; but having no mode of meafuring time, 1 knew nothing of its duration. When I awakened, I was aftonilhed to find by my fide another form, per- feflly fimilar to my own.

"According to our author, two errors have been fallen Id. p. 8r. ;nto in treating of this point; namely, i. That in the firft ages of the world, both before and after the Flood, men began to propagate their kind as early as they commonly do at prefent. 2. That the children of the a3 fame father fucceeded one after another as fall as they Of the ages do now, that is, that the women brought forth chil- of puberty dren every year. The firft of thefe errors he confutes, •mong the flowing that the feveral periods or ftages of man’s vians * U"" ^ ^ear a ju^ proportion' to one another, and to the whole term of life ; and that the period of puberty or maturity has not been the fame at all times, but is ac¬ cording to the length or brevity of life in the different ages of the world, according to that remark of St Au- guftine, Tanto ferior fuit proportion pubertas, quanto vitx totius major anmfitds. Mofes, he obferves, gives the age of the world from the creation to the deluge, and from that period to his own time chiefly by gene¬ rations. A generation is the interval of years between the births of father and fon. This the Latins call xtas> and the Greeks Now, a generation, or the interval of years between father and fon, has not been, neither poflibly could be, the fame in all ages from the beginning, as Voffius juftly obferves ; but has varied greatly according to the length or brevity of man’s life in the feveral periods of the world. Since the ordinary term of man’s life has been reduced to 70 and 80 years, the time of puberty is in proportion to this brevity of life, and reckoned at 20 or 2 1, which is the fourth part of a life of fourfcore. The feveral ftages of human life are infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, full age, declenfion, old or decrepit age; all which commonly bear a proportion to the whole term of life. Now the bounds and limits of thefe fe¬ veral ftages cannot be precifely the fame in all, but va¬ ry in refpeifl of the difpofition of mens bodies, their courfe of life, and alfo the places and ages in which they live. In the Antediluvian world then, when men lived to upwards of 8co and 900 years, can it be thought that they paffed through the feveral ftages of life in aslhort a time as men do now, who feldom ex¬ ceed 80, and not one in ten arrives at that age ? But if the Antediluvians arrived at puberty or manhood as foon as men do now, then would the feveral ttages of human life have been loft or confounded, and men would have ftartedfrom childhood to manhood at once, without any due or regular intervals, contrary to the order of nature : But if, according to the prefent ce- conomy of nature, man is but a youth at 20, which is a fourth part of our term of life, we may reafom ably conclude, there would be a fuitable proportion of years in a much longer term of life, fince nature is conftant and uniform in her operations. And though in fo long a life as the Antediluvians enjoyed, the time of puberty might be a fifth or a fixth-part of their term of life, yet would they be but youths at 150 or 160; which bears much the fame proportion to the whole of their life as 20 is to that of ours",Of,TR,3,Turkey,Asia
"every mother fuckled her own children in thofe early '1 days ; and indeed where could Ihe have found another to have done it for her i Taking it for granted, then, that it was an univer- fal cuftom for women to fuckle their children as well before as after the flood, the next queftion is, for how long time they continued nurfes ? He fhows various • inftances, that when man’s life was reduced to 130 or Of the time 140 years, the ordinary time of nurfing was two years : allotted for he thence infers, that for three or four generations af- flng “ ter the flood, when men lived to above 400 years, they1” 8 eir'^ time would be fo much longer in proportion, and would not be lefs than three or four years ; and confequently, that before the flood, when life was protracted to 800 or 900 years, it would be ftill longer in proportion to their longevity ; fo that five years might be the ordi¬ nary time of nurfing in the Old World; and there¬ fore that we cannot reckon lefs than fix years between the births. For man’s life being prolonged to fo ma¬ ny hundred years at firft for the more fpeedy peopling- of the earth, he came by flow degrees to mature age, there being a long time required to rear up a body that was to laft near toco years. The intervals therefore of infancy, childhood, youth, and mature age, were fo much longer in proportion to ours as the difference is between our term of life and theirs; and 150 or 160 years, with refpeft to their longevity, was no more in ’ proportion than 20 is to the brevity of our life. As the Antediluvians therefore were fo very longDiftance in growing up to mature age, he concludes that the betweenthe time of nurfing could not be ihorter than five years, and that the diftance between the births in a regular way muft be fet at fix years",Of,TR,3,Turkey,Asia

"ANFONIDES vander Goes (John), an eminent T)utch poet, born at Goes in Zealand, the 3d of April 1647. His parents were Anabaptifts, people of good ■charafler, but of low circumftances. They went to live ■at Amfterdam when Antonides was about four years old; and, in the ninth year of hrs age, he began his ftu- dies, under the direction of Hadrian Junius and James Cocceius. Antonides took great pleafure in reading the I,atin poets, and carefully compared them with Gro- tiaSj Heinfius, &c. By this means he acquired a tafte for poetry, and enriched his mind with noble ideas. He firft attempted to tranflate fome pieces of Ovid, Horace, and other ancients; and, having formed his tafte on thefe excellent models, he at length undertook one of the, molt difficult talks in poetry, to write a tragedy : this was intitled ‘Irazil, or The Irtvajion of China. An¬ tonides, however, was fo modeft, as not to permit it to be publifhed. Vondel, who was then engaged in n dra- Antonide* matic piece, which was taken alfo from fome event that 8 , happened in China, read Antonides’s tragedy; and was . ntoninus.‘ fo well pleafed with it, that he declared, if the author would not print it, he would take fome pafl'ages out of it, and make ufe of them in his own tragedy. He ac¬ cordingly did fo ; and it was reckoned much to the ho¬ nour of Antonides, to have written what might be adopted by fo great a poet as Vondel. was acknow¬ ledged to be by all good judges. Upon the conclufion of the peace between Great Britain and Holland, in the year 1697, Antonides wrote a piece, intitled Be/tona aanband, i. e. “ Bellona chained ;”a very elegant poem, confifting of feveral hundred verfes. He next wrote an ingenious heroic poem, which he intitled The River T (the river on which Amfterdam is built)","Goes, Goes, Holland","CN,NL,US",3,"China,Netherlands,United States","Asia,Europe,North America"

He (laid feveral days at Smyrna ; and, after he had fettled the •affairs of the eaft, went to Athens, on which city he conferred feveral honours, and appointed public profef- fors there.

"AORNUS, a very high rock of India, having its name from its extraordinary height, as being above the flight of a bird.

This rock was taken by Alexander the Great, in whofe time there was a report that Hercules had at¬ tempted it in vain; however, according to Arrian, this report was without foundation. It is probable indeed, that it was raifed after the place was taken, in order to magnify Alexander’s exploit. While the Macedo¬ nian monarch was preparing all things neceflary for the fiege, an old man with his two fons, who had long li¬ ved in a cave near the fummit, came and offered to mow him a private way of afcending. This being readily accepted, Ftolemy, with a confiderable body of light¬ armed troops, was difpatched with them, with orders in cafe they fucceeded, to entrench themfelves ftrongly upon the rock, in the wood to which the old man was to direct them, before they ventured to attack the Ins- dians. Ptolemy exactly executed his orders; and gave notice, by a lighted torch fet upon a pole, that he had got fafely up. Upon this, Alexander gave immediate orders for a body of troops to attempt the paffage by which the rock was commonly afcended; but they were repulfed with great flaughter. He then fent an Indian with letters to Ptolemy, defiring him, the next time an attack was made by the common way, to fall upon the enemy behind. But in the mean time, thofe who de¬ fended the rock attacked Ptolemy with great vigour ;• but were atlaft repulfed, though with much difficulty: but the next day, when Alexander renewed the attack^ though Ptolemy attacked the Indians in the rear, the Macedonians were repulfed on both fides, At laft the king, perceiving that the ftrength of the Indians lay in the ftraitnefs and declivity of the way by which they were attacked, caufed a . great quantity of trees to be felled, and with them filled the cavities between the lain on which the Indians were encamped and the igheft of his own advanced ports.

"On Mahomet’s arrival at Mecca, his firft care was to build a mofque for his religious worfhip, and an houfe for himfelf. The city of Medina at that time was inha¬ bited partly by Jews and partly by heretical Chriftians, that formed two fa&ions which perlecuted one another with great violence. This gave the impoftor fuch an opportunity of propagating his new religion, that in a fhort time the city was entirely at his devotion. Here he ftrengthened himfelf by marrying Ayeftia the daugh¬ ter of Abu Beer, though then only feven years of ag£, and gave his own daughter Fatima in marriage to Ali, U 2 the A R A [ 156 1 A R A Arabia, the fon of Abu Taleb.

Afterwards he directed them to pray with their faces towards the temple of Jerufalem, probably with a view to ingratiate himfelf with the Jews ; and now, in order to gain the Pagan Arabs, he ordered his followers to pray with their fa¬ ces towards the eaft. This inconftancy gave great of¬ fence, and occafioned the apoftacy of many of his dif- ciples. About this time Mahomet receiving advice that a rich caravan of the Koreifh was on the road from Syria to Mecca, he detached his uncle Hamza, at the head of 30'horfe, to feize upon it; who accordingly lay in wait for it in one of the woods of Yamama, thro’ which it was to pafs ; here, however, he was inform¬ ed that the caravan was guarded by 300 men, fo that he returned without making any attempt; but the prophet made the proper difpofitions for a&ing here¬ after againft the Koreilh with fuccefs.

His firft exploit was the taking of a caravan gams the attended by a fmall guard ; and this being accomplifh- Bedr °r ec* by a party confifting only of nine men, contributed greatly to encourage the Moflems. But what moft e- Itablifhed the impoftor’s affairs, and was indeed the true foundation of all his future greatnefs, was his gain¬ ing the battle of Bedr ; of which we have the follow¬ ing account. The prophet being informed that Abu, Sofian Ebn Harb efcorted a caravan of the Koreifh v. ith only 30 or 40 men, refolved to advance at the head of a fmall detachment of his troops to intercept it. To this he was excited by the riches of the cara¬ van, which confifted of a large quantity of merchan¬ dize, confifting of the riches of Syria, carried on the backs of a thoufand camels. He therefore fent out a party to reconnoitre it, with orders to wait in fome convenient place, where they might remain undifeo- vered. But Abu Sofian having notice of Mahomet’s motions, difpatched a courier to Mecca, requefting fuccours from his countrymen, that he might be able to defend the caravan. Upon this Mahomet drew toge¬ ther all his forces, which amounted to no more than 313, while his enemies confifted of very near TOGO, Arabia",Mecca,"SY,SA",3,"Syrian Arab Republic,Saudi Arabia","Asia,Asia"
"Though this aCtion may feem of little confequence in itfelf, it was of very great advantage to Mahomet’s affairs at that time. He was immediately treated with the higheft refpeCt by the Najafhi, or king of Ethio¬ pia, who received a particular account of the victory foon after it was gained; while the fuperftitious Moi- lems did not fail to look upon it as an evident declara¬ tion of heaven in their favour. Nay, notwithftanding the fmall number of enemies to be overcome, and who were only mortal men, thefe ignorant bigots did not hefitate to own the afliftance of no lefs than 4000 an¬ gels, who, according to them, rode on black and white horfes, having on their heads white and yellow fafhes, that hung down between their fhoulders ! Notwithftanding this difafter, however, Abu Sofian made a pretty good retreat, and conducted the greateft part of the caravan to Mecca. This chagrined the Moflems, though they found great fpoil on the field of battle ; the divifion of which had likely to have proved fatal to their caufe, by the quarrels that it oc¬ cafioned among them. So hot, indeed, were the dif- putes on this occafion, that the impoftor was obliged , to pretend an immediate revelation from heaven, em- His law powering him to retain a fifth part for religious pur- concerning pofes, and to diftribute the reft equally. This became tbedivifion a law for his fucceflbrs; but, with regard to himfelf, the of prophet often took the liberty of infringing it; for which, no doubt, a new revelation was always a ready and convenient falvo. As for thofe who were flain on Mahomet’s part in this battle, they were all looked upon by the Moflems as martyrs; and the prophet per¬ ceiving among the prifoners two of his inveterate ene¬ mies, immediately caufed their heads to be ftruck off",Mecca,SA,3,Saudi Arabia,Asia
"The Koreifti, in order to be revenged on Mahomet for their late defeat at Bedr, fent Amru Ebn Al As,, who afterwards conquered Egypt, with fome other of their principal people, on an embaffy to the king of Ethiopia, in order to intereft him in their quarrel. To do this the more effectually, they accufed Mahomet and his followers of fpeaking difrefpeCtfully of Jesus and of his mother Mary ; which accufation they ho¬ ped would likewife induce him to deliver up the Mof¬ lem refugees that were then at his court. But the bad fuccefs that had attended the arms of the Koreifh hi¬ therto, joined to the excufes made by the refugees* not only hindered the Najafhi from delivering them up* but AHA [ iJ7 ] A R A 49 twattle of )hod",Mary,"EG,ET,TM",3,"Egypt,Ethiopia,Turkmenistan","Africa,Africa,Asia"
"but alfo prompted him to difmifs the ambafladorsj and return the prefents they had brought him. In the mean time, Abu Sofian, who had fworn never to ufe perfumes or enjoy women till he had another battle with Mahomet, fet out from Mecca with a body of 200 horfe. He advanced to a poll within three miles of Medina; from whence he fent a detachment, who burnt a barn, together with a man it it that was win* nowing wheat. Mahomet, being informed of this outrage, moved immediately towards him with a de¬ tachment of cavalry ; but Abu Sofian was fo intimi¬ dated by his approach, that he fled with precipitation, leaving behind him all the facks of flour or meal that had been brought for the fubflftence of his troops. In- ftead therefore of coming to an engag_ement with the impoftor, as he had fworn, he contented himfelf with a- larming the country, and pillaging fuch as he fufpec- ted of favouring Mahometanifm.—This year alfo Ma¬ homet conquered the tribes called Banu Solaim, Chat- fan, and the Banu Kainoka; plundering likewife a rich caravan belonging to the Koreifh, and acquiring from thence 2j,ooo dirhems for his own {hare of the plunder","Mecca, Medina","SA,US",3,"Saudi Arabia,United States","Asia,North America"
"Of thefe 200 were cuirafliers; but he had only one horfe befides his own in the whole army. He diftri- buted three fiandards among his troops ; of which one was given to the tribe of Aws, another to that of Khazraj, and the third to the Mohajerin. The grand ftandard was carried before the prophet by Mofaab Ebn Omair. With thefe forces Mahomet formed a camp in a village near Ohod, a mountain about four miles north of Medina, which he contrived to have on his back ; and the better to fecure his men from being furrounded, he placed 50 archers, the flower of his troops, in the rear, with ftridt orders not to quit their port. On the other hand, the army of the Koreifh was drawn up in the form of a crefcent, and made a very good appearance. The right wing was commanded by Khaled Ebn A1 Walid, afterwards fo terrible to the Greeks ; the left by Acrema Ebn Abu Jahl; and the centre by Abu Sofian. The corps de referve was headed by Abu Sofian’s wife, accompanied by 15 other matrons, who performed the office of drummers, lamenting the fate of their countrymen flain at Bedr, in order to animate the troops who attended them","Of, Medina","TR,US",3,"Turkey,United States","Asia,North America"

Upon this Khaled, per¬ ceiving the Moflem army to be greatly expofed, at¬ tacked them in the rear with fuch bravery, that he turned the fortune of the day.

"This was done by communicating fome poifon to a fhoulder of mutton, of which one of his companions na¬ med Bajbar Ebn Al Bara, eating heartily, died upon the fpot; and Mahomet himfelf, though he recovered a little, and lived three years after, yet never enjoyed perfect health. Notwithftanding this misfortune, how¬ ever, he ft ill continued his enterprizes. The year 630 proved remarkably fortunate. It was ufhered in by the converfion of Khalid Ebn Al Walid, Amru Ebn Al As, and Otbman Ebn Telha, three of the moft conftderable perfons among the Koreifti; and this foon enabled him to become mailer of the whole peninfula 5g of Arabia.

"A1 Zobier was ordered to advance with a detachment towards the town on the fide of mount Cada. Saad Ebn Obad, prince of the tribe Khazraj, marched by his order with another detachment towards the height of Coda, which commands the plain of Mecca. Ali commanded the left wing of the army, confifting of An¬ fars and Mohajerin. The prophet put into his hands the great ftandard of Mahometanifm, with orders to poft himfelf upon mount A1 Hajun, and to plant the ftandard there ;, ftriftly enjoining him, however, not to ftir from thence till he himfelf arrived, and till-a proper fignal ihould be given him from Saad for that purpofe.

"■ The death of Mahomet occafioned fuch a confterna* tion in Mecca, that the governor hid himfelf, fearing to be called to an account for his former conduft; and the inhabitants, upon the firft arrival of this melancholy news, confidered themfelves as deftitute of all manner of protection. After the firft impreftions of their fear, however, wrere over, they began to meditate a revolt; but were prevented by one Sohail Ebn Amru, a prin¬ cipal man of the Koreifti. The tumults at Medina, how¬ ever, were not fo eafily appeafed. The news of this fad event was no fooner publifhed there, than a number of people aflembled before his door, crying out, “ How can our apoftle be dead? Our interceffor, our medi¬ ator, has not entirely left us ! He is taken up into hea¬ ven, as was Ifa(Jefus); therefore he fhall not be buried.’, This was confirmed by Omar; who drew his fword,and fwore, that if any perfon affirmed Mahomet to be dead, he would cut off his hands and his feet. “ The Apo¬ ftle of God (fays he) is not dead : he is only gone for a feafon, as Mofes the fon of Amram was gone from the people of Ifrael for forty days, and then returned to them again.” The populace therefore kept the body above ground, even after the belly began to fwell; nor could the prophet’s uncle A1 Abbas, notwithftand- ing this, convince them to the contrary.

"Immediately after Youkinna had fhut himfelf Tip in ’ the caftle, a council of war was held in the Moflem camp, wherein it wras deliberated what mealures were to be purfued on. the prefent occafion. Khaled gave it as }iis opinion, that the caftle ought immediately to be attacked with all the Arab forces, before the emperor had time to fend them any afli.ftance. This advice was followed by AbtxObeidahj who caufed the citadel to noeuvre he likewife hoped that Ycukinna would be L upon his guard. Herein, however, he found him¬ felf miftaken: for the Greek commander, by the pru¬ dent meafures he took, eluded all furprize ; and tho’ Abu Obeidah continued the fiege for four months al¬ ter the laft-mentioned blow given to the garrifon by Khaled, yet he had fcarce any hopes of making himfelf mafter of it at laft. Having nothing material to write to the khalif, he remained a long time filent; at which Omar being very much concerned, wrote to him, dell¬ ring an account of the affairs in Syria. Abu Obeidah acquainted him that the city of Aleppo had fubmitted to him ; and that the citadel was the only place which held out in all that country, before which he had loft a great number of men, which, he faid, had induced him to think of railing the fiege, and moving with his ar¬ my m that track which lay between Antioch and A- leppo. This news was by no means, agreeable to the khalif, who commanded his general to continue the fiege at all events, and fent him a reinforcement of Arab troops, together with 70 camels, to aflift the infantry in their march. g$ Among the troops fent by Omar on this occafion,Thecnade! there was an Arab of a gigantic fize, called ZWicj. taken bx whoftrata£em* A R A [ 165 ] A R A Arabia, who •was a man of great courage and refolution. He «k»—y . 0bferving tbe little progrefs made by the Moilems, be¬ thought himfelf of a ftratagem by which that fortrefs might be reduced, which leemed fo difficult to be ac- complifhed by force. He therefore deiired that Abu Obeidah would affign him the command of a party con- fifling only of thirty men; which at Khaled’s requeft was readily granted. Then he begged the general to raife the fiege, and retire to about three miles difiance from the cafile, which was like wife immediately com¬ plied with. The following night Dames, who had ported himfelf with his party very near the citadel, found means to feize a Greek, from whom he learned Ithat Youkinna, after the fiege was raifed, had exadted large fums of money from the citizens, on account of the treaty they had concluded with the Arabs and that he was one of thofe who had endeavoured to make their efcape from the opprefiion of fuch a tyrant, by leaping down from the wall. This man Dames took under his protection; but beheaded five or fix others who fell into his hands, and could give no good account of ' % , themfelves. He then covered his head and fhoulders with a goat’s fiun, and took a dry cruft in his hand, creeping on the ground till he got clofe to the foot of the wall. If he heard any noife, or fufpedted any perfon to be near, he made fuch a noife with his cruft as a dog does when he is gnawing a bone ; his compa¬ nions fometimes walking, and fometimes creeping after him in the fame manner. He had before difpatched two of his men to Abu Obeidah, to defire that a de¬ tachment of horfe might be fent him by break of day to fupport his fmall party, and facilitate the execution of the plan he had formed. At laft Dames found an opportunity of raifing fcven men upon his fhoul¬ ders, who flood one upon another’s fhoulders in fuch a manner that the higheft reached the top of the wall. Here he foon placed himfelf, feized a watch¬ man whom he found afleep, and threw him over the wall. Two others, whom he found in the fame condi¬ tion, he ftabbed with his dagger, and threw them over likewife. Then he laid down his turban, and drew up the fecond of his brethren, as they two did the third, and by their help Dames himfelf and all the reft were enabled to mount the wall. He then private¬ ly ftabbed the centry at each of the gates, and put his men in pofleffion of every one of them.

"After the reduction of the citadel of Aleppo, Abui Obeidah intended to march to Antioch ; but was di¬ verted by Youkinna, who was now become a violent enemy to the Chriftians. He told the Moftem gene¬ ral, that his conqueft of that part of the country would not be complete without the reduftion of Azaz, a_ place of great importance, where Theodoras, Ycukin- Arabia, na’s coufin-german, was commandant. This forlrefs Jie propofed to become mafter of, by putting himfelf at the head of too Arab horfe drelfed in the Greek habit, who were to attend him to Azaz. Upon his arrival there, he was to affure Theodorus that he was Hill in reality a Chriftian, and had taken that opportunity to . efcape from the Mortem camp. But, to make his fto- ry more probable, Abu Obeidah was to fend after him a detachment of 1000 horfe, who were to purfue him as far as Morah, a village in the neighbourhood of Azaz, with orders to poft themfelves there; from whence, if fuch a meafure ftiould be found neceflary, they might eafily advance to Azaz, to facilitate the conqueft of that place. To this fcheme Abu Obeidah agreed; but Youkinna with all his men were immedi¬ ately taken prifoners by Theodorus, who had been in¬ formed of the whole affair by a ipy in the Mcflem camp, who had fent him a letter by a pigeon.

"ARARAT, the name of the mountain on which Noah’s ark refted, after the abatement of the waters of the univerfal deluge. Concerning this mountain there are various conjectures ; though it is almoft uni- verfally allowed to be in Armenia Major. Some are of opinion that it is one of the mountains which divide Armenia on the fouth from Mefopotamia and that part of Affyria inhabited by the Curds ; from whom thefe mountains took the name of Curdu or Cardu, by the Greeks turned into Girdyai, &c. Others, that it lies towards the middle of Armenia, near the river Araxes, above 280 miles diftant from the abovementioned moun¬ tains, making it belong to mount Taurus ; but the Armenians are pofitive that Noah’s Ararat is no other than a mountain to which they now give the name of Majis, which lies about 12 leagues to the eaft of Eri- van, and four leagues from the Aras. It is encompaf- fed by feveral petty hills : on the tops of them are found many ruins, thought to have been the buildings of the firft men, who were, for fome time, afraid to defcend into the plains.

It feems fo high and big, that, when the air is clear, it may be feen four or five days journey off; yet travellers think the height is not extraordinary.

It is compofed of ftones enormoufly large ; many of them being 30 feet long, four feet high, and three in breadth; and all this huge mafs of building was coated over with fquare flags of marble.—The ftnufhire called the laby¬ rinth, in the fame country, according to Herodotus, who faw it, excelled every thing which he could have conceived from the imagination either of himfelf or-o- thers. Within the fame circuit of walls they had in- clofed 5000 halls, 12 of which were of a Angular form and beauty ; and of thefe, half were above, and half below ground; and the whole was terminated by a py¬ ramid 40 fathoms high. All this prodigious mafs of building was compofed of white marble, and the walls were adorned with engravings.—The ebelifles were not lefs aftonifiling; the largeft of them being entire pieces of granite, no lefs than 18© feet high.—Near Andera, in Upper Egypt, are the ruins of a palace of gray granite, the cielings of which arefupported by columns of fuch thicknefs, that four men can fcarcely fathom them. The cielings themfelves are compofed of ftones of the fame kind, fix or feven feet in breadth and 18 feet in length. The grand hall is 112 feet long, 60 high, and 58 broad. The roof of the whole edifice is a terrace, on which the Arabs formerly built a very large village, the ruins of which are ftill vifible. 5 Among the Babylonians and Perfians, too, fuch im-Among the menfe piles of building have been raifed, as appear ut-Babylo,li' terly inconceivable, and incredible to many modern au-ansil,ui thors where their former grandeur is not demonftrable Per ,ans' by ruins vifible at this day. The ruins of Perfepolis, the ancient capital of Perfia, were fo ftupendous in the time of Avicenna the Arab phyfician, that his coun¬ trymen could not believe fuch ftrudtures pofiible to be eredted but by evil fpirits. Of their extraordinary magnificence, indeed, we may have fome idea from the account of the ftair-cafes belonging to the palace. The remains, foroe time ago, confifted of 9 5 fteps of white marble, fo broad and flat, that 12 horfes might conve¬ niently go up abreaft. 6 In thefe vaft ftrudtures, however, the nations ofwhomTheir ■we fpeak deem to have regarded the greatnefs, ratherbuiitlings than the elegance or ufefulnefs of their works. In themor® jA pyramids and obelilks of Egypt this is exceedinglyf^great- confpicuous; but whether it was fo in the labyrinth ornefs than in the palace at Thebes above mentioned, it is impof-elegance, fible to determine, unlefs the buildings were entire, and w.e knew for what purpofe they had been defigned. If the kings who built the pyramids defigned to immor¬ talize their memories by building, they certainly could not have fallen upon any thing more proper for this purpofe ; though even in this they have fome how or other failed, the names of thole who eredted them not being certainly known even in the time of Herodotus.— 7 It is certain, however, that neither the ancient Affy-,r£norantof' rians nor Babylonians knew the method of conftrudt-jlle,ufe ■ing arches.

A R C H I T of building was alfo quite deftitute of what is now called tajh; the columns were ill-proportioned, and their capitals executed in the pooreft manner imagi¬ nable. This was obferved by the Greeks, who im¬ proved upon the proportions formerly ufed, and were the inventors of three of the five orders of architecture, 8 viz. the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. “ Anciently And of pro-(fays Vitruvius) they were ignorant of the art of pro¬ portioning portioning the various parts of a building: they ufed columns. cojurnns ., km they cut them at hazard, without rules, without principles, and without having any attention to the proportions which they ought to give them : they placed them likewife without any regard to the other parts of the edifice.

"Ancient We have already taken notice, that among the an- architec- cient Egyptians, Perfians, and Babylonians, the vaft ture fupe- ftrength and extent of their buildings feems to have deurto^h""^cen w^at they chiefly valued ; and in this they cer- modern. ^ ta^n^7 as muck excelled the Greeks and modern nations as the latter excel them in the beautiful proportion and elegance of their ftrudttires. There are not want¬ ing, however, fome modern authors, who endeavour to deprive the ancients of what is juftly their due, and will have every thing to be exaggerated which feems be¬ yond the power of modem princes to accompliflx. In this way M. Goguet remarkably diftinguifhes himfelf; and that without giving any reafon at all, but merely that he takes it into his head. Speaking of the won¬ ders of ancient Babylon, “ All thefe works (fays he), fo marvellous in the judgment of antiquity, appear to me to have been extremely exaggerated by the authors who have fpoken of them. How can we conceive, in effect, that the walls of Babylon could have been sr8 feet high and 81 in thicknefs, in a compafs of near ten leagues ?” To this we may eafily reply, that the pyramids of Egypt, and the immenfe wall which di¬ vides China from Tartary, fhow us, that even fuch a work as the wall of ancient Babylon is faid to have been is not altogether incredible. The loweft com¬ putation of the dimenfion of the Chinefe wall is, that it extends in length 1200 miles, is 18 feet high at a medium and as many thick ; according to which com¬ putation, it muft contain 9,504,000 folid fathoms ; and yet, if we may credit the Chinefe hiftorians, this .immenfe mafs of building was finilhed in five years. If therefore we can fuppofe Nebuchadnezzar, or whoever ■fortified the city of Babylon, to have been capable of employing as many men for 10 years as were employ¬ ed in railing the Chinefe wall, we may fuppofe him able to have fortified the city of Babylon as ftrongly as it is faid to have been ; for the mafs of building is not quite double that of the Chinefe wall, though nearly .fo, amounting to 18,189,’600 folid fathoms. When onr author afterwards gafeonades about the works of the French king, it is difficult to avoid laughter at hearing him declare, that “ infinitely more money has been expended, and much more genius required, as well as more power-, tale, and time, to finilh Verfailles, •with all its defedls, than to conftnnft a pyramid, or e- red an obeliflt.” The genius, tafte, and time, we .fliall not difpute ; but as the fame author confeffes that J 00)000 men were employed for 30 years together in the conftrudion of the largeft pyramid, we think the power may juftly be doubted. This doubt will appear ftill the more reafonable, when we confider what time -the ahovementioned number of men would have taken to accomplilh fomc of the works of which M. Goguet •boafts fo much.

"edifices of the Arabians (we may include the other o- rientals) as extraordinary as their thoughts. If any one doubts of this affertion, let us appeal to’ any one who has feen the.mofques and palaces of Fez, or .fome of the cathedrals in Spain built by the Moors : one model of this fort is the church at Burgos; and even in this ifland there are not wanting feveral examples of the fame ; fuch buildings have been vulgarly called modern Gothic, but their true appellation is Arabic, Saracenic, or Morefque.*--This manner was introduced E c T tl R E. Hiftorjf into Europe thro’ Spain. Learning ffouriftied: among the Arabians all the time that their dominion was in full power; they ftudied philofophy, mathematics, phyfic and poetry. The love of learning was at once excited; in all places that wer^, not at too great a diftance from Spain, thefe authors were read; and fuch of the Greek authors as they had tranflated into | Arabic, were from thence turned into Latin. The phyfic and philofophy of the Arabians fpread themfelves in Europe, and with thefe their architeClure: many churches were built after the Saracenic mode ; and o- thers with a mixture of heavy and light proportions, the alteration that the difference of the climate might require, was little, if at all confidered. In moft fou- thern parts of Europe, and in Africa, the windows (before the ufe of glafs), made with narrow apertures, and placed very high in the walls of the building, occa- fioned a fliade and darknefs within fide, and were all i contrived to guard againft the fierce rays of the fun ; yet were ill fuited to latitudes, where that glorious lu* minary fliades its feebler influences, and is rarely feen but through a watery cloud.” Mr Grofe, however, thinks the above opinion is notfuf- ficiently favoured by the obfervations of feveral learned travellers -who have accurately furveyed the ancient mode of building in thofe parts of the world. Thus Cornelius le Brun, an indefatigable and inquifitive tra¬ veller, has publifhed many views of eaftern buildings, particularly about the Holy Land: in all thefe, only one Gothic ruin, the church near Acre, and a few pointed arches occur; and thofe built by the Chri- ftians when in poffeffion of the country. Near Ifpa- han, in Perfia, he gives feveral buildings wuth pointed arches : but thefe are bridges and caravanferas, whofe age cannot be afcertained ; confequently are as likely to have been built after,as before the introduction of this ftyle into Europe. At Ifpahan itfelf, the mey doen, or grand, market-place, is furrounded by divers magnificent Gothic buildings ; particularly the royal ■ mofque, and the Talael Ali-kapie, or theatre. The magnificent bridge of Alla-werdie-chan, over the river Zenderoet, 540 paces long and 17 broad, having 33 pointed arches, is alfo a Gothic ftruCture; but no mention is made when or by whom thefe are built","Burgos, Cornelius","ES,PH,US,GR",3,"Spain,Philippines,United States,Greece","Europe,Asia,North America,Europe"
"One building indeed, Mr Grofe admits, feems at firft as if it W'ould corroborate this affertion, and that the time when it was eredled might be in fome degree fix¬ ed ; it is the tomb of Abdalla, one of the apoftles of Mahomet,probably him furnamed Abu Beer. “ If this tomb (fays he)is fuppofed to have been built foon af- • ter his death, eftimating that even to have happened according to the common courfe of nature, it will place its ereClion about the middle of the feventh cen¬ tury : but this is by far too1 conjectural to be much de¬ pended on.

Hiji were built in all parts, together with the many mag* ^ccJaa nificent cloifters and monafteries, and other apartments ' ' of monks, that were then ereCted, afford a fufficient proof of .the great felicity of England in the reign of Henry 1. The religious of every order, enjoying peace and profperity, difplayed the moft aftonilhing ardour in every thing that might increafe the fplendor of divine worftiip. The fervent zeal of die faithful prompted them to pull down houfes and churches every where, and rebuild them in a better manner. By this •means the ancient edifices that had been raifed in the -d ays of Edgar, Edward, and other Chriflian kings, were demolimed, and others .of greater magnitude and magnificence, and of more elegant workmanftiip, were erected in their room, to the glory of God.” As the prodigious power of religious zeal, what¬ ever turn it happens to take, when it is thoroughly heated, Is well known, it may not be improper to give -one example of the arts employed by the clergy and monks of this period, to inflame the pious ardour of the kings, nobles, and people, for building and adorn¬ ing churches.

"In the midffi of all this haughtinels, however, he was unexpectedly vifited by an ambaflador from Lucullus the Roman general, who without any ceremony told him, that he came to demand Mithridates king of Pontus, who had taken refuge in his dominions, and, in cafe of his re'ufal, to declare war againft him. Not- withftanding his high opinion of himfelf, 'Pigranes re¬ turned a mild anfwer to this meflage : in which, how¬ ever, he refufed to deliver up his father-in-law 5 and being highly provoked at Lucullus for not giving him the title of King of kings in his letter, he did not fo much as beftow upon him the title of general in his anfwer.

"Lucullus, on the other hand, hearing the king’s re- folution to proteCI Mithridat.es, immediately began his march for Armenia, at the head of only two legions of foot and 3000 horfe, having left 6000 men in Pon¬ tus to keep that country quiet. Having palled the Eu¬ phrates without oppofition, he detached two parties ; one to befiege a city where he heard that Tigranes’s treafure and concubines were kept ; and the other un¬ der Sextilius, to block up Tigranocerta, in order to draw the king to a battle. But Tigranes, after having put to death the feout that brought him the firft intel¬ ligence of the approach of the Romans, made towards Mount Taurus, which he had appointed for the place of the general rendezvous. The Roman general then difpatched Muraena in purfuit of the king ; who having overtaken him in a narrow pafs, defeated him, and, be- fides all the baggage, carried off a great many prifon- ers, the king himfelf having fled in the beginning of the Ikirmilh. After this, he fent out feveral parties to fcour the country, in order to prevent the innumerable forces of Tigranes from joining into one body. This, however, he was not able to effeft : Tigranes was join¬ ed by fuch numbersyff Gordians, Medes, Adiabenians, Albanians, Iberians, &c. that, before he left Mount Taurus, his army confifted, according to Plutarch, of A 150,000 foot armed cap-a-pee, 35,000 pioneers, 20,000 archers and {lingers, and 55,000 horfe",,AM,3,Armenia,Asia
"Lucullus was fo far from being difmayed at this formidable army, that the only fear he had was left the king fhould follow the advice of Mithridates, which was not to engage the Romans, but, by ravaging the country, diftrefs them for want of provifions. In or¬ der to draw him to a battle, therefore, he formed the fiege of Pigranocerta, imagining that Tigranes would never fuffer that fine city to be taken without making any attempt to relieve it. The event fully anfwered his expe&ations : Tigranes having called a council of war, it was unanimomly refolved to attack the Romans j and Taxilis, whom Mithridates lent to diffuade the king from venturing a battle, was in danger of lofing his head on account of the advice he gave. The Roman general, finding 'i igranes difpofed to come to an en¬ gagement, left Muraena with*6ooo men to carry on the fiege, while he himfelf marched againft the king’s vaft army with only 10,000 men, according to feme, and the higheft computations make them no more than 18,000. The Romans were at firft greatly difheart- ened ; but being encouraged by Lucullus, they imme¬ diately broke the Armenian army, who betook them- felves to flight almoft at the firft onfet. The Romans purfued them til! night, making a moft terrible (laugh¬ ter. Plutarch informs us, that of the Armenians 100,000 foot were killed, and that very few of the ca¬ valry efcaped ; whereas of the Romans only five men were killed and 100 wounded. Antiochus the phi- lofopher mentioning this battle, fays, that the fen never beheld the like ; and Livy, that the Ro¬ mans never fought at fuch a difadvantage ; the con¬ querors not amounting to a twentieth part of the con¬ quered. Tigranes in his flight having met with his fen in as forlorn a condition as himfelf, refigned to him his royal robes and diadem, defirfng him to fliift for* himfelf and fave thofe royal enfigns. The young prince delivered them to a trufty friend, who, being- taken by the Romans, configned them to Lucullus",,AM,3,Armenia,Asia
"The two kings, having levied new forces, appointed their troops to rendezvous in the fpacious plains on the other fide of Mount Taurus; whereupon Lucullus, leaving Gordyene, and paffing by Mount Taurus, en¬ camped clofe by the enemy. Several fkirmifhes hap¬ pened for feme time between the two armies without any- ARM t 334 ] ARM Armenia, any confiderable advantage $ but Lucullus could by A no means draw them to a general engagement. Up¬ on this he decamped, as if he defigned to march to Artaxata and lay fiege to that place, where Tigranes had left his wife and children, with great part of his treafures. He had fcarce formed his camp when the enemy appeared, and fat down clofe by him. Lu- cullus did not allow them to fortify their camp, but immediately attacked them, and having put them to flight after a faint refiifance, purfued them all night with great flaughter, took moft of the chief offi¬ cers prifoners, and returned the next day loaded with booty",,AM,3,Armenia,Asia
"The Roman fbldiers now, finding the cold very fe- vere, though it was no later in the year than the au¬ tumnal equinox, requefted their general to allow them to retire into winter-quarters.

Lu¬ cullus did all he could to perfuade them to continue in their duty ; and prevailed lb far that they conlented to lay fiege to Nifibis in hopes of booty. This place they took; and Lucullus, to the great fatisfaclion of his troops, took up his winter-quarters there. The next year, however, his forces again mutinied, accu- fing him of amafling immenfe wealth for himfelf; and throwing their empty purfes at his feet, told him, that as he enriched himfelf alone, he might carry on the war by himfelf. He endeavoured to appeafe them as much as poffible ; but the fedition being fomented by a party who favoured Pompey the great, at that time afpiringto the command of Lucullus’s army, the latter found himfelf obliged to fit ftill and fee Mithridates and Tigranes over run Cappadocia, and recover all Ar¬ menia and great part of Pontus.

Fig. 85, ta-tl’e ken from Newton’s Pripcipia, reprefents fo much ofot 1 the traje&ory of this comet as it paffed through while it was vifible to the inhabitants of our earth, in going from and returning to its perihelion. It {hows alfo the tail, as k appeared on the days mentioned in the figure. The tail, like that of other comets, increafed in length and brighthefs as it came nearer to the fun ; and grew fhorter and fainter as it went farther from him and from the earth, till that and the comet were too far.off to be any longer vifible. uj “ The comet of 1744 was firft feen at Laufanne in Of that of Switzerland, Dec. J3th, 1743, From that time1?44, it increafed in brightnefs and magnitude as it was co¬ ming nearer to the fun. The diameter of it, when at the diftance of the fun from us, meafured about one minute 5 which brings it out equal to three times the diameter of the earth. It came fo near Mercury, that, if its attraffion had been proportionable to its magni¬ tude, it was thought probable it would have difturbed the motion of that planet. Mr Betts of Oxford, how¬ ever, from fome obfervations made there, and at Lord Macclesfield’s obfervatory at Sherburn, found, that when the comet was at its leaft diftance from Mercury, and almoft twice as near the fun as that planet was, it was ftill diftant from him a fifth part of the diftance of the fun from the earth ; and could therefore have no effedf upon the planet’s motions. He judged the co¬ met to be at leaft equal in magnitude to the earth.

Its tail extended above 16 degrees from its body ; and was in length, fuppofing the fun’s parallax 10"", no lefs than 23 millions of miles.

In confe- Of the pe- quence of this, the mean diftance of a comet from the thnes^&c ^Un ma^ ke f°un^ hy comparing its period with the of the’ C’ t'me t^ie earth’s revolution round the fun. Thus comets, the period of the comet that appeared in 1531, 1607, 1682, and 1759, being about 76 years, its mean di- flance from the fun may be found by this proportion : As 1, the fquare of one year, the earth’s periodical time, is to 5776 the fquare of 76, the comet’s periodical time; fo is 1,000,©00, the cube of too the earth’s mean diftance from the fun, to 5,776,000,000, the cube of the comet’s mean diftance. The cube root of this laft number is 1794; the mean diftance itfelf in fuch parts as the mean diftance of the earth from the fun contains too. If the perihelion diftance of this comet, 58, be taken from 3588 double the mean diftance, we fhall have the aphelion diftance, 3530, of fuch parts as the diftance of the earth contains ico; which is a little more than 35 times the diftance of the earth from the fun. By a like method, the aphelion diftance of the comet of 1680 comes out 138 times the mean diftance of the earth from the fun, fuppofing its period to be 575 years: fo that this comet, in its aphelion, goes more than 14 times the diftance from the fun that Sa¬ turn does. Euler computes the orbit of this comet from three of Jlamftead’s obfervations taken near together, compared with a fourth taken at fome di- flance from the other three; and from thence concludes the period to be a little more than 170 years. “ It feems fomething furprifing (fays Dr Long), that, from the fame obfervations which were ufed by New¬ ton and Halley, he fhould bring out a period fo very different from what thofe great men have determined : but it is the lefs to be wondered at, if we confider how fmall a portion of the comet’s orbit lay between the moft diftant places ufed in this computation, or indeed that could be had for that purpofe; fo fmall, that the form of the ellipfis cannot be found with precifion by this method, except the comet’s places were more ex- aftly verified than is poffible to be done : and that he does not pretend to confirm his determination of the period by pointing out and comparing together any former appearances of this comet; a method which Newton recommended as the only one whereby the periodical times and tranfverfe diameters of the orbits of the comets can be determined with accuracy.” The period of the comet in 1744 is much longer than even that of 1680. Mr Betts, in attempting to compute the tranfverfe axis of its orbit, found it come out fo near infinite, that, though the orbit fhowed itfelf in this manner to be a very long one, he found it impof- fible to calculate it without fome obfervations made Dr Halley a^ter *ts perihelion. Halley, after he had finilhed his calculates table of comets, found fuch a fimilitude in the elements the return of thofe of 1531, 1607, and 1682, that he was indu¬ ct comets. ced to believe them to be returns of the fame comet in an elliptic orbit: but as there was fuch a difference in their periodical times and inclinations of their or¬ bits as feemed to make againft this opinion ; and as the obfervations of the firll of them in 1531 by Appian, and the fecond in 1607 by Kepler, were not exa& e-Conclufions nough to determine fo nice a point when he firft pub- ^rom t.*ie liflied his fynopfis in 1705 ; he only mentioned this as A^Wanfu- a thing probable, and recommended it to pofterity toccs> watch for an appearance of the fame in 1758. After-i—y—J wards, looking over the catalogue of ancient comets, and finding three others at equal intervals with thofe now mentioned, he grew more politive in his opi¬ nion ; and knowing a method of calculating with eafe a motion in an elliptic orbit, how eccentric foever it might be, inltead of the parabolic orbit which he had given for tire comet of 1682, he let about adapting the plan of that orbit to an ellipfis of a given fpace and magnitude, having the fun in one of its foci, fo as to tally with the obfervations of that comet made by Flam- ftead with great accuracy, by the help of a very large fextant. He likewife corredled the places of the comet of 1531 from Appian, and thofe of the comet 1607 from Kepler and Longomontanus, by re&ifying the places of the ftars they had made ufe of, and found thofe places agree as well with the motion in fuch an ellipfis as could be expe&ed from the manner of ob- ferving of thefe aftronomers, and the imperfections of their inftruments. The greateft objection to this theory was fome difference in the inclination of the orbits, and that there was above a year’s difference be- jpr tween the two periods. The comet of 1531 was in Why the its perihelion Augull 24. ; that of 1607, O&ober 16.; periodical and that of 1682, September 4. : fo that the firft c,f^t”g""s<^a thefe periods was more than 76, the latter not quite 75 years. To obviate this, he reminds his readers ofuneqUai an obfervation made by him of the periodical revolu-intervals, tion of Saturn having at one time been about 13 days longer than at another time ; occafioned, as he fup- pofed, by the near approach of Saturn and Jupiter, and the mutual attradtion and gravitation of the two pla¬ nets : and obferves, that in the fummer of the year 1681, the comet in its defeent was for fome time fo near Ju¬ piter, that its gravitation towards that planet was one- fiftieth part of its gravitation towards the fun. This, he concluded, would caufe a change in the inclination of its orbit, and alfo in the velocity of its motion : for by continuing longer near the planet Jupiter on the fide moft remote from the fun, its velocity would be more increafed by the joint forces of both thofe bodies, than it would be diminilhed by them adting contrary- wife, when on the fide next the fun where its motion was fwifteft. The projedtile motion being thus in¬ creafed, its orbit would be enlarged, and its period lengthened ; fo that he thought it probable it would not return till after a longer period than 76 years, about the end of the year 1758 or beguiling of i?59* As Halley exprefied his opinion modeftly, though clearly enough, that this comet would appear again about the end of 1758, or the beginning of the fol¬ lowing year, M. de la Lande pretends he muft have been at a lofs to know whether the period he foretold would have been of 75 or of 76 years ; that he did not give a decilive predidlion, as if it had been the re- fult of calculation ; and that, by confidering the affair in fo loofe a manner as Halley did, there was a good deal of room for objefting to his reafoning. After thefe refledtions, he is very large in his commendation of the performance of Clairault; who, he fays, not 4?o ASTRO Conclufions only calculated ftridtly the effeft of the atiradlion of from the Jupiter in i68i and 1683, when the comet W'as again Appearan- near JuP'ter> ^ut not negk& the attraftion of that C£S. planet w-hen the comet was moft diftant ; that he con- t——y——J fidered the uninterrupted attractions of Jupiter and Saturn upon the fun and upon the comet, hut chiefly the attraction of Jupiter upon the fun, whereby that luminary was a little difplaced, and gave different ele¬ ments to the orbit of the comet. By this method he found the comet would be in its perihelion about the middle of April ; but that, on account of fome fmall quantities neceffarily negleCted in the method of ap¬ proximation made ufe of by him, Mr Clairault de- fired to be indulged one month ; and that the comet came juft 30 .days before the time he had fixed for its appearance","Of, Un, Newton, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter","US,TR,IN",3,"United States,Turkey,India","North America,Asia,Asia"
"It is true, the various magnitudes of the fixed ftars even then plainly fuggefted to us, and would have better fuited, the idea of an expanded firmament of three dimenfions ; but the obfervations upon which I am now going to enter, ftill farther illuftrate and en¬ force the neceffity of confidering the heavens in this point of view. In future therefore we (hall look upon thofe regions into which we may now penetrate by means of fuch large telefcopes, (a) as a naturalift re¬ gards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains, containing ftrata varioully inclined and direfted, as well as confifting of very different materials. A fur- face of a globe or map therefore will but ill delineate the interior parts of the heavens.” With the powerful telefcope mentioned in the note, Mr Herfchel firft began to furvey the Via Ladfea, and found that it completely refolved the whitifh appear¬ ance into ftars, which the telefcopes he formerly ufed had not light enough to do. The portion he firft ob¬ ferved was that about the hand and club of Orion ; and found therein an aftonifhing multitude of ftars, whofe number he endeavoured to eftimate by counting many fields (b), and computing from a mean of thefe how many might be contained in a given portion of the milky-way. In the moft vacant place to be met with in that neighbourhood he found 63 ftars ; other fix fields contained 110, 60, 70, yo, 70, and 74 ftars ; a mean of all which gave 79 for the number of ftars to each field : and thus he found, that by allowing 15 minutes for the diameter of his field of view, a belt of 15 degrees long and two broad, which he had often No 32",Orion,PH,3,Philippines,Asia
"“ Another ftratum, which perhaps approaches nearer to the folar fyftem than any of the reft, and whofe fi- tuation is nearly at redangles with the great fidereal ftratum in which the fun is placed, is that of Coma Berenices, as 1 fhall call it. I fuppofe the Coma it- felf to be one of the clutters in it, and that on account of its nearnefs it appears to be fo fcattered. It has many capital nebulae very near it: and in all probabi¬ lity this ftratum runs out a very confiderable way. It may perhaps even make the circuit of the heavens, though very likely not in one of the great circles of the fphere •, for unlefs it ftiould chance to interfed the great fidereal ftratum of the milky way before men¬ tioned, in the very place in which the fun is ftationed, fuch an appearance would hardly be produced. How¬ ever, if the ftratum of Coma Berenices ftiould extend fo far as I apprehend it may, the diredion of it to¬ wards the north lies probably, with fome windings, through the Great Bear onwards to Caffiopeia, thence through the Girdle of Andromeda and the Northern Fifti, proceeding towards Cetus; while towards the fouth it pafles through the Virgin, probably on to the tail of Hydra and Centaurus.” By a continued feries of obfervations, Mr Herfchel became confirmed in his notions ; and in a fucceeding paper * has given a fketch of his opinions concerning the interior conftrudion of the heavens,—“ That the Of the in-way (fays he) is a moll extenfive ftratum of ftmftionnofftars of various fizes’ adm:‘ts 110 longer t!le leaft ofthehea- doubt ; and that our fun is one of the heavenly bodies vens. belonging to it is as evident.

The power by which the moon is influenced dits of the j^g keen a]rea(jy fhown to be the fame with that which Planets. we ca^ gravity. Now, one of the effects of the prin- ciple of gravity is, that all bodies defcend by this force 303 from equal heights in equal times. This was taken Properties notice of long ago ; and particular methods have been of gravity invented to fhow, that the only caufe why fome bo- tedTh^en ^'£8 weie °bferved to fall in a fliorter time than others c3ninmoPCn was the refiftance of the air. As thefe methods, how¬ ever, have been found liable to fome uncertainty, Sir Ifaac'Newton had recourfe to experiments made on pendulums. Thefe vibrate by the fame power which makes heavy bodies fall to the ground ; but if the ball ©f any pendulum of the fame length with another were more or lefs attra&ed in proportion to the quantity of folid matter it contains, that pendulum mutt then vi¬ brate fafter or flower than the other. Now the vibra¬ tions of pendulums continue for a long time, and the number of vibrations they make may be eafily deter¬ mined without any fufpicion of error 5 fo that this ex¬ periment may be extended to what exadtnefs we pleafe : and Sir Ifaac affures us, that he examined in this way feveral fubftances, as gold, filver, lead, glafs, fand, common fait, wood, water, and wheat ; in all which he found not the leafl; deviation from the theory, tho* he made the experiment in fuch a manner, that in bo¬ dies of the fame weight, a difference in the quantity of their matter lefs than the thoufandth part of the whole ■would have difcovered itfelf. It appears, therefore, that all bodies are made to defcend here by the power of gravity with the fame degree of fwiftnefs. This de- icent has already been determined at 16-J- feet in a fe- cond from the beginning of their fall. It has alfo been obferved, that if any terreftrial body could be convey¬ ed as high up as the moon, it would defcend with the very fame degree of velocity with which the moon is attrafted toward the earth 5 and therefore that the power of the earth upon the moon bears the fame pro¬ portion it would have upon thofe bodies at the fame ^04 diftance as the quantity of matter in the moon bears Attrattion t0 t^ie quantity in thofe bodies. Thus the affertion is proportion-proved in the earth, that its power on every body it «d to the attracts is, at the fame diftance from the earth, propor- quantity of tjonaj t0 ^ qUant;ty of folid matter in the body afted a el'1 upon. As to the fun, it has been fhown, that the power of his adtion upon the fame primary planet is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion ofiits diftance ; and that the power of the fun decreafes throughout in the fame proportion, is teftified by the motion of the planets traverfing the whole planetary region. This proves, that if any planet were removed from the fun to any diftance whatever, the degree of its acceleration towards the fun vvould yet be reciprocally in the dupli¬ cate proportion o'f their diftance. But it has already been proved, that the degree of acceleration given to the planets by the fun is reciprocally in the duplicate pro¬ portion of their refpe&ive diftances ; all which, compa¬ red together, puts it out cf doubt, that the power of the fun upon any planet removed into the place of any other, would give it the fame velocity of defcent as it gives that other 5 and confequently that the fun’s ac¬ tion upon different planets at the fame diftance would be proportionable to the quantity cf matter in each.

"BAI^E, an ancient village of Campania in Italy, between the promontory of Mifenum and Puteoli, on the Sinus Baianus-; famous for its natural hot baths, which ferved the wealthier Romans for the purpofes both of medicine and pleafure.—The variety of thofe baths, the foftnefs of its climate, and the beauty of its landfcape, captivated the minds of opulent nobles, whofe paffion for bathing knew no bounds. Abun¬ dance of linen, and difufe of ointments, render the pra&ice lefs neceffary in modern life ; but the ancients performed no exercife, engaged in no ftudy, without previous ablutions, which at Rome required an enor- mousexpence inaquedu<fts,ftoves,andattendants: aplace therefore, where waters naturally heated to everydegree of warmth bubbled fpontaneoufly out of the ground, in the pleafanteft of all fituations, was fuch a treafure as could not be overlooked. Bake was this place in the higheft perfeftion ; its eafy communication with Rome was alfo a point of great weight. Hither at firft retired for a temporary relaxation the mighty ru¬ lers of the world, to ftring anew their nerves and re¬ vive their fpirits, fatigued with bloody campaigns and civil contefts. Their habitations were fmall and modeft: but foon increafing luxury added palace to palace with fuch expedition and fumptuofity, that ground was wanting for the vaft demand : enterprifing architects, fupported by infinite wealth, carried their foundations into the fea, and drove that element back from its 'f ancient limits: it has fince taken ample revenge, and recovered much more than it ever loft.

It would lead us too far to enter more minutely into the defcription of this aftonilhing edifice. The lovers of the arts will find it defcribed with the greateft truth and accuracy in a work publifhed at London in 1757, under the title of Ruins of Balbec. This work, compiled by Mr Ro¬ bert Wood, the world owes to the attention and libe¬ rality of Mr Daw'kins, who in 1751 vifited Balbec and Palmyra. But feveral changes, however, have taken place fince their journey : for example, they found nine large columns (landing; and in 17S4 Mr Volney found but fix. They reckoned 29 at the lefler temple ; but there now remain but 20 ; the others have been overthrown by the earthquake of 1759. It has likewife fo (haken the walls of the leffer temple, that the done of the foffit, or croft (lone at the top of the gate, has (lid between the two adjoining ones, and de- of their refearches, added to the opprefiions and ex-' tortions of the governors, who have made their fup- pofed difcoveries a pretext, have at length difiieartened them ; but they imagine the Europeans would be more fuccefsful; nor would it be pofiible to perfuade them but what we are pofieffed of the magic art of deftroy- ing talifmans. It is in vain to oppofe reafon to igno* ranee and prejudice : and it would be no left ridicu¬ lous to attempt to prove to them, that Solomon never was acquainted with the Corinthian order* which was only in ufe under the Roman emperors. But their tradition on the fubjeft of this prince may fugged three important obfervations. Firft, That all tradition re¬ lative to high antiquity is as falfe arpong the Orientals as the Europeans. With them, as with us, fadts which happened 100 years before, when not preferred in wri¬ ting, are altered, mutilated, or forgotten. To expedb information from them with refp'edl to events in the time of Davitl or Alexander, would be as abfurdas to make inquiries of the Flemilh peafants concerning Clo- Charlemagne. Secondly, That throughout Sy- feended eight inches; by which means the body of ria, the Mahometans, as well as the Jews and Chridians, the bird fculptured on that done is fufpended detached from its wings and the two garlands which hung from its beak, and terminated in two genii Nature alone has not effected this devadation ; the Turks have had their (hare in the dedrudlion of the columns. Their motive is to procure the iron cramps, which ferve to join the feveral blocks of which each column is com- pofed. Thefe Cramps anfwer fo well the end intend- attribute every great work to Solomon : not that the memory of him dill remains by tradition in thofe coun¬ tries, but from certain paffages in the Old Tedament; which, with the gofpel, is thefource of almod all their tradition, as thefe are the only hidorical books read or known ; but as their expounders are very ignorant, their applications of what they are told are generally very remote from truth : by an error of this kind, they ed, that feveral of the columns are not even disjointed pretend Balbec is the houfe of the forejl of Lebanon built by their fall; one, among others, as Mr Wood ob- ferves, has penetrated a done of the temple wall with¬ out giving way ; nothing can furpafs the workmanfhip of thefe columns ; they are joined without any cement, yet there is not room for the blade of a knife between their interdices. After fo many ages, they in gene¬ ral (HU retain their original whitenefs. But what is dill more adonifhing, is the enormous (tones which compofe the (loping wall., To the wed the fecond layer is formed of dones which are from 28 to 35 feet by Solomon ; nor do they approach nearer probability when they attribute to that king the well of Tyre and the buildings of Palmyra. Thirdly, That the belief in hidden treafures has been confirmed by difcoveries which have been really made from tirrv e. It is not many years fince a fmall coffer wa>, fo at He¬ bron full of gold and filver medals, with an ancient Arabic book on medicine. In the country of the Druzes, an individual difeovered likewife, fome time fince, ajar with gold coin in the form of a crefcent; long, by about nine in height.

"When we confider the extraordinary magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be aftonilhed at the filence of the Greek and Roman authors. Mr Wood, who has carefully examined all the ancient wri¬ ters, has found no mention of it, except in a fragment of John of Antioch, who attributes the conftru&ioa of this edifice to Antoninus Pips. The inferiptions of explaining it, by fuppofing thefe edifices to have which remain corroborate this opinion, which perfedt- been conftnnSted by Djenoun, or genii, who obeyed 1 c —a-—- ~r- -r il-~ /~i-— the orders of King Solomon ; adding, that the motive -of fuch immenfe works was to conceal in fubterraneous caverns vaft treafures, which (till remain there. To difeover thefe, many have defeended into the vaults Vol. II. Part II, ly accounts for the conftant ufe of the Corinthian or¬ der, fince that order was not in general ufe before the third age of Rome ; but we ought by no means to al¬ lege as an additional proof the bird fculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and 5 D the B A L [76 Balbec the caduceus he bears, give him the appearance of an H eagle, the tuft of feathers on his head, like that of _ US’ .certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman eagle : ~ befides that the fame bird is found in the temple of Palmyra; and is therefore evidently an oriental eagle, confecrated to the fun, who was the divinity adored in both thefe temples. His worfhip exifted at Balbec in the moft remote antiquity. His ftatue, which rcfem- bled that of Ofiris, had been tranfported there from the Heliopolis of Egypt, and the ceremonies with which he was worlhipped there have been defcribed by Mac- robius, in his curious work intitled Saturnalia. Mr Wood fuppofes with reafon, that the name of Balbec, which in Syriac fignifies City of Bal, or of the fun, o- riginated in this worfhip. The Greeks, by naming it Heliopolis, have in this indance only given a literal tranflation of the oriental word; a pra&ice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the date of this city in remote antiquity ; but it is to be prefumed, that its fituation, on the road from Tyre to Palmyra, gave it fome part of the commerce of thefe opulent capitals. Under the Romans, in the time of Auguftus, it is mentioned as a garrifon-town; and there is ftill remaining, on the wall of the fouthern gate, on the right as we enter, an infcription which proves the truth of this, the words kenturia prima, in Greek charafters, being very legible. One hundred and forty years after, Antoninus built there the pre- fent temple, inftead of the ancient one, which was doubtlefs falling into ruins : but Chriftianity having gained the afcendency under Conftantine, the modern temple was negle&ed, and afterwards converted into a church ; a wall of which is now remaining, that hid the fanftuary of the idols. It continued thus until the invafion of the Arabs, when it is probable they envied the Chriftians fo beautiful a building. The church be¬ ing lefs frequented, fell to decay ; wars fucceeded ; and it was converted into a place of defence ; battlements were built on the wall which furrounded it, on the pa¬ vilions, and at the angles, which ftill fubfift; and from that time, the temple, expofed to the fate of war, fell rapidly to ruin. The ftate of the city is not lefs de¬ plorable. The wretched government of the emirs of the houfe of Harfoufhe had already greatly impaired it; and the earthquake of 1759 completed its de- ftruftion. The wars of the Emir Youfef and Djezzar have rendered it ftill more defected and ruinous. Of 5000 inhabitants, at which number they were eftima- ted in 1751, not 1200 are now remaining; and all thefe poor, without induftry or commerce, and culti¬ vating nothing but a little cotton, fome maize, and water-melons","Roman, Antioch, Rome, Roman, Tyre, Of","RO,US,GR,EG,LB,TR",3,"Romania,United States,Greece,Egypt,Lebanon,Turkey","Europe,North America,Europe,Africa,Asia,Asia"

"BALEN, (Hendrick Van), hiftory and portrait painter, was born at Antwerp, in 1560, and was a difciple of Adam Van Oort; but he quitted that ma¬ tter, to acquire a better tafte of defign and compofition, by purfuing his ftudies at Rome, where he relided for a confiderable time. He copied the antiques ; he at¬ tended to the works of the moft memorable modern artifts; and at his return to his own country, the vi- fible improvement of his tafte recommended him to the favour and efteem of the ableft judges of the art. He diftinguilhed himfelf by a good manner of defigning, and his works are admitted into the cabinets of the curious, among thofe of the principal painters. He particularly excelled in the naked, and gave to his fi¬ gures fo much truth, roundnefs, and correftnefs of outline, that few of his cotemporaries could enter into competition with him. Several fine portraits of his hand are at the Hague ; among which there is one ad¬ orned with allegorical figures of Wifdom and Juftice, which extorts commendation from all who attentively confider it. He died in 1632. All the hiftorical fub- jefts painted by Van Balen have abundant merit. His defigns of the Deluge, of Mofes ftriking the Rock, and the drowning of Pharaoh, are grand and noble compofitions. Houbraken obferves, that Van Balen, with great judgment, hath introduced the Ifraelites in a clear light in the back-ground, but the Egyptians in a ftrong ihadow in the fore-ground, which had a very fine effeift; the figures being well defigned, the atti¬ tudes and draperies well chofen, and the number of the figures being very confiderable. Of this painter’s hand alfo, the Judgement of Paris is accounted a mafterly performance; in which the figure of Venus is fo ele¬ gantly defigned, fo full of life, and fo round, that it feems to ftand forth from the furface.

"BAPTIST (John), Monnoyer, a painter of flowers and fruit, vyas born at Lifle in 1635, and educated at Antwerp, where he perfected himfelf in the knowledge of his art, and in his firft years was intended for a painter of hiftory: but having foon. obferved that his genius more ftongly inclined him to the painting of flowers, he applied his talents to thofe fubjefts, and in that ftyle became one of the greateft mafters. His pi&ures are not fo exquifitely finilhed as thofe of Van Huyfum, but his compofition and colourifig are in a bolder ftyle. His flowers have generally a remarkable freedom and loofenefs, as well in the difpofition as in penciling; together with a tone of colouring that is lively, admirable, and nature itfelf. The difpofition of his objefts is furprifingly elegant and beautiful; and in that refpeft his compoiitions are eafily known, and as ealily diftinguilhed from the performances of others",Van,TR,3,Turkey,Asia
"Inftead of adminifteritig the ordinance by fprinkling ■v* or pouring water, they maintain that it ought to be adminiftered only by immerfion. Such, they infill, is the meaning of the word; fo that a command Baptifh. - to baptize is a command to immerfe. Thus it was underftood by thofe who firft adminiftered it. John the Baptift, and the apoftles of Chrift, adminiftered it in Jordan and other rivers, and places where there was much water. Both the adminiftrators and the fubjedls are defcribed as going down into, and coming up again out of, the water ; and the baptized are faid to be buried in baptifm, and to be railed again ; which lan¬ guage could not, they fay, be properly adopted on (uppofition of the ordinance being adminiftered in any other manner than by imrqis.rfion. Thus alfo, they af¬ firm, it was in general atdminiftered in the primitive church. Thus it is now admihiftered in the Ruffian and Greek church : and thus it is, at this day, direded to be adminiftered in the church of England, to all who are thought capable of fubmitting to it in this manner. With regard to the fubjeds afrbaptifm, the baptifts fay, that this ordinance ought not to be admi¬ niftered to children or infants at all, nor to grown up perfons in general; but to adults only of a certain cha- rader and defcription. Our Saviour’s commiffion to his apoftles, by which Chriftian baptilm was inftitu- ted, is to go and teach all nations, baptizing them: that is, fay they, not to baptize all they meet with ; but firft to inftrud them—to teach all nations, or to preach the gofpel to every creature—and whoever re¬ ceives it, him to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoft. To fiich perfons, and to fuch only, baptifm appears to have been adminiftered by the apoftles, and the immediate dif- ciples of Chrift. They are defcribed as repenting of their fins, as believing in Chrift, and as having gladly received the word. Without thefe qualifications, Pe¬ ter acquaints thofe who were converted by his fermon, that he could not have admitted them to baptifm",,"JO,GR",3,"Jordan,Greece","Asia,Europe"
"Thefe profpefts, together with the ftorm between the king and parliament, which was beginning to break out in England, induced many new adventurers to tranfport themfelves into this ifland. And what is ex¬ tremely remarkable, fo great was the increafe of people 1 in Baibadoes, 25 years after its firft fettlement, that in 1650 it contained more than 50,000 whites, and a much greater number of negro and Indian (laves. The ' latter they acquired by means not at all to their ho¬ nour: for they feized upon all thofe unhappy men, without any pretence, in the neighbouring iflands, and carried them into flavery; a practice which has ren¬ dered the Caribbee 1 ndians irreconcileable to us ever fince. They had begun a little before this to cultivate fugar, which foon rendered them extremely wealthy",,IN,3,India,Asia
"The number of (laves, therefore, was dill augmented ; and in 1676 it is fuppofed that their number amount¬ ed to 100,000, which, together with 50,000 whites, make 150.000 on this fmall fpot: a degree of popu¬ lation unknown in Holland, in China, or any other part of the world moft renowned for numbers. At this time Barbadoes employed 400 fail of (hips, one with another, of 150 tons in their trade. Their annual ex¬ ports in fugar, indigo, ginger, cotton, and citron- water, were above L. 35,000, and their circulating ca(h at home was L. 200,000. Such was the increafe of population, trade, and wealth, in the courfe of 50 years. But fince that time this ifland has been much on the decline ; which is to be attributed partly to the growth of the French fugar colonies, and partly to our own eftablifliments in the neighbouring ides. Their numbers at prefent are faid to be 20,000 whites, and 100,000 (laves. Their commerce confifts of the fame articles as formerly, though they deal in them to left extent",Holland,"CN,US,FR",3,"China,United States,France","Asia,North America,Europe"
