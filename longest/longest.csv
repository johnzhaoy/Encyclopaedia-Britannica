1,africa.csv,"We come now to the culture of the palm-tree, which is the fixth and mo/l plaufible argument employed by the fexuali/ls. Herodotus, Theophra/lus, Pliny, and fome others, have informed us, that the female palm-tree, unlefs ANY. 647 a male grows fu/fieiently near it, or unlefs the pollen be artificially conveyed to the female fpatha, will produce nothing but four dates and unfertile feeds. This fad is partly denied by Pere-Labat and Tournefort. The for¬ mer of thefe authors exprefsly affirms, that a female palm- tree, in the garden belonging to the mona/lery at Mar- tinico, produced mo/l excellent fruit, although there was not a male within fix miles of it : From which he con¬ cludes, that the prefence of the male is not neceffary to render this tree fruitful, whatever may be pretended by ancient or modern naturali/ls. Herodotus relates, th«' the people of Babylon, when the male was at too great a di/lance from the female, made a rope pafs from the boughs of the one to the boughs of the other, to afford an opportunity to the culices and other infecls to pafs along the rope, and convey fome kind of impregnating influence from the male to the female. Tournefort, wiien he was in that country, inquired at the mo/l in¬ telligent people of the place, as to the truth of this re¬ lation ; but received for anfwer, That they had never heard of any fuch matter. Even the favourers of the fexual hypothefis give very different accounts of the me¬ thod of cultivating palm-trees in thofe countries. Vef- lingius, who refided many years in Egypt, denies that any artificial method is employed for frudlifying the palm-trees in that country. Thus Yeflingius exprefsly contradidls Herodotus and many others. In a word, ai- mo/l every different author gives a different account of this /lory. Amid/l fo many contradidlions concerning the culture of palm-trees, the oppofers of the fexes conclude, that the whole /lory is a vular error, taken for granted by fome learned men, fpurioufly fathered upon others, and fwallowed down without examination by their cre¬ dulous readers.—As we have not feen any anfwer to Mylefius’s letter on this fubjecl, our obfervations upon it /hall be reffrved till this bi/lorical view of the contro- verfy be finiffied"

Linnaeus, when the plant was firft prefen ted. to. him, imagined it to he fume kind SB of 650 B O T of deception. But, after a more accurate examination, the notion of a fj>urious iflue opportunely came to his aid. The thought pleafed him on a double account: It had a direct tendency to corroborate his favourite hypo- thelis, and laid the foundation of another ftill more ex¬ travagant. Now, thinks he, by this ineftimable difco- very, we Ihall be enabled to take a dry and rigid plant from the mountain’s top, make it copulate with a moift and fpungy aquatic, and their offspring will participate of the rigidity and hardnefs of the former, together with the moifture arid flaccidity of the latter; and hence mankind fhall foon be blefled with an eafy purchafe of their united virtues when flourifliing in the intermediate vale ! More wonderful ftill, we fhall caufe the plants which dwell upon the frozen mountains of Greenland to intermarry with the more delicate and wayward inhabi¬ tants of the torrid zone, and the conftitutions of their children fhall be fo moulded and attempered, that they will live moft comfortably in every temperate clime!— Not contented with extracting two theories out of this iingle plant, Linnaeus forms a third ftill more wild and fantaftical: “ From this curious phenomenon,” fays he, “ it is natural to think, that only two fpecies of each genus exifted ab origins, and that all the variety of fpe¬ cies which now appear are only the fpan of fortuitous commixtures !” If either the fortuitous or artificial copulation of two different fpecies were capable of producing a third per¬ fectly diftinCt from the other two, the number of fpecies would be infinite. According to our author, every blaft of wind, every butterfly, would daily produce hundreds of new fpecies. Neither the gardener nor hufbandman could purchafe feeds with fafety, unlefs they cotild difco- ver, from inipeCfion, whether they had been impregnated by the femen of the fame, or of a different fpecies. Lin naeus would have us to believe, not only that different fpecies of the fame genus copulate together, but even that genera belonging to different claffes engender, and beget mules. For example, he makes the poterium hy- bridum a begot by the agrimonia eupatoria the poterium fanguiforba. The agrimonia belongs to the do- decandria digynia clafs, and the poterium to the moncecia polyandria. Now, let any man ferioufly confider the un¬ avoidable confequences that would follow on the fuppofi- tion that this wanton proftitution of fexes really exifted a- mong vegetables In the firft place, it would be impofi- fible to reduce botany to any regular fyftem ; for every feafon would produce fuch a troop of new and ftrange plants, as would confound every fcheme or method of claffification that ever was, or ever will be invented. A botanift, for inftance, carefully collects and preferves the f^eds of the poterium, in order to raife that plant next feafon; but, after fowing the feeds, to bis utter afto- mfhment, not a Angle poterium appears, but every one of them is metamorphofed into a fpecies of agrimonia, a plant fo totally different that it cannot even be arranged under the fame clafs. ' adly, Linnasus is obliged to con- fiefs, that his vegetable mules, are not fubjeCted to that perverfe law of nature, which cruelly prevents animal mules from propagating their fpecies.

To perpetuate the memory of this daughter, he intitled his commentary upon the Decretals of Grego¬ ry IX. the Novella. He married her to John Calde- rinus, a learned canonift. The firft work of Andreas was his Glofs upon the fixth Book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote alfo Gloffes upon the Clementines; and a Commentary in regulas Sexti, which he intitled Mercuriales, becaufc he either engaged in it on Wednefdays (diebus Mercit- rii,) or becaufe he inferted his Wednefdays difputes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durant, in the year 1347. This is all which Mr Bayle mentions of his writings, tho’ he wrote many more. Andreas died of the plague at Bologna,, in 1348, after, he had been a profeffor 45 years ; and was buried in the church of the DominicanSi Many eulogiums have been beftowed upon him. He has been called archidoftor decreto>- rum: In his epitaph, Rabbi doftorum; lux, cenfort nomaque morum ; “ Rabbi of the doctors, the light, cenfor, and rule of mannersAnd it is faid, that pope Boniface called him lumen mundi, “ the light of the world.” Andreas (John) was born a Mahometan, at Xativa in the kingdom of Valencia, and fucceeded his father in the dignity of alfaqui of that city. He was enlight¬ ened with the knowledge of the Chriftian religion by being prefent at a fermon in the great church of Va¬ lencia on the day of Aiiumption of the bleffed Virgin, in the year 1487. Upon this he defired to be bapti¬ zed; and, in memory of the calling of St John and St Andrew, he received the name John Andreas. “ Ha¬ ving received holy orders (fayshe), and, from an alfaqui and a flave of Lucifer, become a prieft and minifter of Chrift; I began, like St Paul, to preach and publifh the contrary of what I had erroneoufly believed and afferted ; and, with the affiftance of Almighty God, AND Andreas J converted at firll a great many fouls of the Moors, (J'’bn) who were in danger of hell, and under the dominion Andrelinas Lucifer, and conduced them into the way of falva-    tion. After this, I was fent for by the moll catholic prince, king Ferdinand, and queen Ifabella, in order to preach in Granada to the Moors of that kingdom, which their majefties had conquered: by God’s blef- fing on my preaching, an infinite number of Moors were brought to abjure Mahomet, and to turn to Chrift. A little after this, I was made a canon by their grace; and fent for again by the moll Chriftian queen Ifabella to Arragon, that I might be employed in the converfion of the Moors of thofe kingdoms, who ftill perfifted in their errors, to the great contempt and dilhonour of our crucified Saviour, and the prodigious lofs and danger of all Chriftian princes. But this ex¬ cellent and pious defign of her majefty was rendered in- effe£lual by her death.” At the defire of Martin Gar¬ cia, bilhop of Barcelona, he undertook to tranllate from the Arabic, into the language of Arragon, the whole law of the Moors ; and after having finilhed this undertaking, he compofed his famous work of Ths Confufton of the Sett of Mahumed; it contains twelve chapters, wherein he has collefted the fabulous ftories, impoftures, forgeries, brutalities, follies, obfcenities, absurdities, impoflibilities, lies, and contradi&ions, which Mahomet, in order to deceive the fimple peo¬ ple, has difperfed in the writings of that feft, and e- fpecially in the alcoran, which, as he fays, was revealed to him in one night by an angel, in the city of Meke; though in another place he contradicts himfelf, and af¬ firms that he was 20 years in compofing it. Andreas tells us, he wrote this work, that not only the learned amongft Chriftians, but even the common people might know the different belief and doCtrine of the Moors ; and on the one hand might laugh and ridicule fuch in- folent and brutal notions, and on the other might la¬ ment their blindnefs and dangerous condition.

A tent or a cavern might fuffice for the worfhip of the favages, but an edifice of done and clay has been erefted in its place ; and the art and power of the monarchs of the eaft have been confined to the fimplicity of the original model, h fpacious por¬ tico inclofes the quadrangle of the Caaba; a fquare cha¬ pel, 24 cubits long, 23 broad, and 27 high ; a door and a window admit the light; the double roof is fupported by three pillars of wood; a fpout (now of gold) dif- charges therain-water,and the wellZemzem is protected by a dome from accidental pollution.

Thus comets, the period of the comet that appeared in 1531, 1607, 1682, and 1759, being about 76 years, its mean di- flance from the fun may be found by this proportion : As 1, the fquare of one year, the earth’s periodical time, is to 5776 the fquare of 76, the comet’s periodical time; fo is 1,000,©00, the cube of too the earth’s mean diftance from the fun, to 5,776,000,000, the cube of the comet’s mean diftance. The cube root of this laft number is 1794; the mean diftance itfelf in fuch parts as the mean diftance of the earth from the fun contains too. If the perihelion diftance of this comet, 58, be taken from 3588 double the mean diftance, we fhall have the aphelion diftance, 3530, of fuch parts as the diftance of the earth contains ico; which is a little more than 35 times the diftance of the earth from the fun. By a like method, the aphelion diftance of the comet of 1680 comes out 138 times the mean diftance of the earth from the fun, fuppofing its period to be 575 years: fo that this comet, in its aphelion, goes more than 14 times the diftance from the fun that Sa¬ turn does. Euler computes the orbit of this comet from three of Jlamftead’s obfervations taken near together, compared with a fourth taken at fome di- flance from the other three; and from thence concludes the period to be a little more than 170 years. “ It feems fomething furprifing (fays Dr Long), that, from the fame obfervations which were ufed by New¬ ton and Halley, he fhould bring out a period fo very different from what thofe great men have determined : but it is the lefs to be wondered at, if we confider how fmall a portion of the comet’s orbit lay between the moft diftant places ufed in this computation, or indeed that could be had for that purpofe; fo fmall, that the form of the ellipfis cannot be found with precifion by this method, except the comet’s places were more ex- aftly verified than is poffible to be done : and that he does not pretend to confirm his determination of the period by pointing out and comparing together any former appearances of this comet; a method which Newton recommended as the only one whereby the periodical times and tranfverfe diameters of the orbits of the comets can be determined with accuracy.” The period of the comet in 1744 is much longer than even that of 1680. Mr Betts, in attempting to compute the tranfverfe axis of its orbit, found it come out fo near infinite, that, though the orbit fhowed itfelf in this manner to be a very long one, he found it impof- fible to calculate it without fome obfervations made Dr Halley a^ter *ts perihelion. Halley, after he had finilhed his calculates table of comets, found fuch a fimilitude in the elements the return of thofe of 1531, 1607, and 1682, that he was indu¬ ct comets. ced to believe them to be returns of the fame comet in an elliptic orbit: but as there was fuch a difference in their periodical times and inclinations of their or¬ bits as feemed to make againft this opinion ; and as the obfervations of the firll of them in 1531 by Appian, and the fecond in 1607 by Kepler, were not exa& e-Conclufions nough to determine fo nice a point when he firft pub- ^rom t.*ie liflied his fynopfis in 1705 ; he only mentioned this as A^Wanfu- a thing probable, and recommended it to pofterity toccs> watch for an appearance of the fame in 1758. After-i—y—J wards, looking over the catalogue of ancient comets, and finding three others at equal intervals with thofe now mentioned, he grew more politive in his opi¬ nion ; and knowing a method of calculating with eafe a motion in an elliptic orbit, how eccentric foever it might be, inltead of the parabolic orbit which he had given for tire comet of 1682, he let about adapting the plan of that orbit to an ellipfis of a given fpace and magnitude, having the fun in one of its foci, fo as to tally with the obfervations of that comet made by Flam- ftead with great accuracy, by the help of a very large fextant. He likewife corredled the places of the comet of 1531 from Appian, and thofe of the comet 1607 from Kepler and Longomontanus, by re&ifying the places of the ftars they had made ufe of, and found thofe places agree as well with the motion in fuch an ellipfis as could be expe&ed from the manner of ob- ferving of thefe aftronomers, and the imperfections of their inftruments. The greateft objection to this theory was fome difference in the inclination of the orbits, and that there was above a year’s difference be- jpr tween the two periods. The comet of 1531 was in Why the its perihelion Augull 24. ; that of 1607, O&ober 16.; periodical and that of 1682, September 4. : fo that the firft c,f^t”g""s<^a thefe periods was more than 76, the latter not quite 75 years. To obviate this, he reminds his readers ofuneqUai an obfervation made by him of the periodical revolu-intervals, tion of Saturn having at one time been about 13 days longer than at another time ; occafioned, as he fup- pofed, by the near approach of Saturn and Jupiter, and the mutual attradtion and gravitation of the two pla¬ nets : and obferves, that in the fummer of the year 1681, the comet in its defeent was for fome time fo near Ju¬ piter, that its gravitation towards that planet was one- fiftieth part of its gravitation towards the fun. This, he concluded, would caufe a change in the inclination of its orbit, and alfo in the velocity of its motion : for by continuing longer near the planet Jupiter on the fide moft remote from the fun, its velocity would be more increafed by the joint forces of both thofe bodies, than it would be diminilhed by them adting contrary- wife, when on the fide next the fun where its motion was fwifteft. The projedtile motion being thus in¬ creafed, its orbit would be enlarged, and its period lengthened ; fo that he thought it probable it would not return till after a longer period than 76 years, about the end of the year 1758 or beguiling of i?59* As Halley exprefied his opinion modeftly, though clearly enough, that this comet would appear again about the end of 1758, or the beginning of the fol¬ lowing year, M. de la Lande pretends he muft have been at a lofs to know whether the period he foretold would have been of 75 or of 76 years ; that he did not give a decilive predidlion, as if it had been the re- fult of calculation ; and that, by confidering the affair in fo loofe a manner as Halley did, there was a good deal of room for objefting to his reafoning. After thefe refledtions, he is very large in his commendation of the performance of Clairault; who, he fays, not 4?o ASTRO Conclufions only calculated ftridtly the effeft of the atiradlion of from the Jupiter in i68i and 1683, when the comet W'as again Appearan- near JuP'ter> ^ut not negk& the attraftion of that C£S. planet w-hen the comet was moft diftant ; that he con- t——y——J fidered the uninterrupted attractions of Jupiter and Saturn upon the fun and upon the comet, hut chiefly the attraction of Jupiter upon the fun, whereby that luminary was a little difplaced, and gave different ele¬ ments to the orbit of the comet. By this method he found the comet would be in its perihelion about the middle of April ; but that, on account of fome fmall quantities neceffarily negleCted in the method of ap¬ proximation made ufe of by him, Mr Clairault de- fired to be indulged one month ; and that the comet came juft 30 .days before the time he had fixed for its appearance"
3,oceania.csv,"Though this tree has been mentioned by many voy¬ agers, particularly by Dampier, by Rumphius, and by Lord Anfon, yet very little notice feems to have been ta¬ ken of it till the return of Captain Wallis from the South Seas, and fince that time by others who have touched at Otaheite and fome countries in the Eaft Indies. Cap¬ tain Dampier relates, that in Guam, one of the La- drone iflands, “ there is a certain fruit called t\\e bread fruit, growing on a tree as big as our large apple-tree?, with dark leaves. The fruit is round, and grows on the boughs like apples, of the bignefs of a good pen¬ ny loaf : wdien ripe, it turns yellow, foft, and fweet j but the natives take it green, and bake it in an oven till the rind is black : this they fcrape off, and eat the infide, which is foft and white, like the infide of new- baked bread, having neither feed nor ftone ; but if it is kept above 24 hours it is harfh. As this fruit is in feafon eight months in the year, the.natives feed upon no other fort of bread during that time. They told us that all the Ladrone iflands had plenty of it. I ne¬ ver heard of it in any other place.” Rumphius, after deforibing the tree, obferves, that "" the fruit is fhaped like a heart, and increafos to the fize of a child’s head. Its furface or rind is thick, green, and covered every where with warts of a qua- dragonal or hexagonal figure, like cut diamonds, but without points. The more flat and fmooth thefe warts are, the fewer feeds are contained in the fruit, and the greater is the quantity of pith, and that of a more glutinous nature. The internal part of the rind, of peel, confifts of a flefhy fubftance, full of .twifted fibres, which have the appearance of fine wool j thefe adhere to, and in fome meafure form it. The fleftiy part of this fruit becomes fofter towards the middle, where there is a fmall cavity formed without any nuts or feeds, except in one fpecies, which has but a fmall number, and this fort is not good, unlefs it is baked or prepared fome other way : but if the outward rind be taken off, and the fibrous flefli dried and afterwards boiled with meat as we do cabbage, it has then the tafte of arti¬ choke bottoms. The inhabitants of Amboyna drefs it in the liquor of cocoa-nuts : but they prefer it roaft- ed on coals till the outward part or peel is burnt. They afterwards cut it into pieces, and eat it with the milk of the cocoa nut. Some people make fritters of it, or fry it in oil; and others, as the Sumatrians, dry the internal foft part, and keep it to ufe inftead of bread with other food.

The paluftris, or water-apple, grows to the height of 30 or 40 feet. The leaves are oblong, pointed, with fome flender furrows, and have a ftrong feent when rubbed ; the fruit is feldom eaten but by negroes. The tree grows in moift places in all the Weil-India iflands. 5. The cherimola, with oblong fcaly fruit, is a native of Peru, where it is much culti¬ vated for the fruit, and grows to be a very large tree well furnifhed with branches. The leaves are of a bright green colour, and much larger than thofe of any of the other forts. The fruit is oblong, and fcaly on the outfide, of a dark purple colour when ripe, and the flefh is foft and fweet, intermixed with many brown feeds which are fmooth and fhining. 6.

4,africa.csv,"Voyage of Planno is faid to have depofited, at his return, Hanno. the journal of his voyage in the temple of Saturn ; which may perhaps account for the means of its pxefer- vation. It begins by Hating, that “ it was decreed by the Carthaginians that Planno fliould undertake a voy¬ age beyond the Pillars of Plercules, and found Liby- phoenician cities. He failed, accordingly, with 60 (hips of 50 oars each, and a body of men and women to the number of 30,000, and proviftons and other neceflaries.” From the extent of this plan of colonization, or rather of eftablifhing permanent garrifons, upon the w’eftern coafts of Africa, it is evident that thefe coafts muft, in fome meafure, have been previoufly examined. Major Rennel, who has inveftigated the fubjedt with great ac¬ curacy, with a reference to the journal of the voyage, is of opinion that the Carthaginian or Libyphoenician cities founded by Planno, were all fttuated to the fouth of the ftrait of Gibraltar, and to the northward of the river Senegal j and that all of them, excepting one at Cerne, now called Arguin, were placed to the north of Cape Bojador. To the fouthward of Cerne, Hanno during his voyage made two expeditions; but it does not appear that he made any attempt to fix an eftablifti- ment beyond the limits now mentioned. On his firft expedition, he feems to have failed into the river Sene¬ gal, as may be fuppofed from the defeription given j for it is faid to be “ large and broad, and full of cro- Africa, codiles and river horfes”. During the fame voyage, ' ^ Hanno made a fecond expedition louthward, apparent¬ ly for the fake of difeovery. He appears to have doubled Cape Verd, and to have failed acrofs the mouth of the Gambia. His voyage is faid to have terminated at a place which he calls the Southern Horn, fuppofed to be either at Sierraleona, or, at a little diftance to the fouth of it, at Sherbro. It is evident, from the general ftyle of the journal, that the Carthaginians, at the time of this voyage, wrere altogether unacquaint¬ ed wuth the interior ftate of the country on this wreftern quarter of Africa. Excepting the mere defeription of the coaft, and its windings and bays, every thing is marvellous, and apparently fabulous. They talk of having caught two women covered with hair, whofe {kins they brought to Carthage, meaning, in all pro¬ bability, two monkeys of fome of the unknow n fpecies which abound in the country of the Negroes. They alfo talk of ftreams of fire, and of rivers of fire which feem- ed to be running into the fea. At one place, during the night, they faw a country which w as on fire: and af¬ terwards they faw another country full of fires ; in the middle of which was a lofty fire, larger than the others, wEich feemed to touch the ftars. When day came, they difeovered this elevated fire to be a large hill, which they called the chariot of the gods. Thefe wonders have been explained to us by later travellers; who remark that it is the cuftom, at certain feefons cf the year, in the country of the Negroes, to fet fire to the dry grafs 5 and that on thefe occafions, during the night, the whole territory feems to be a ftieet of flame. Defeription With regard to Africa in general, Herodotus de-of Africa feribes it in this fummary w ay : “ All that part of by Herodo- Libya towards the northern fea (Mediterranean), from Egypt to the promontory of Soloeis (now Cape Cantin on the coaft of Morocco) which terminates the third divifion of the earth, is inhabited by the different nations of the Libyans ; that diftridt alone excepted in poffeffion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. The remoter parts of Libya beyond the fea coaft, and the people who inhabit its borders, are infefted by various beafts of prey.—The country yet more difant is a parched and immeafarable defert.'"" Here this ancient hiftorian clearly diftingunhes three belts or regions parallel to the Mediterranean, the northernmoft of which we muft conceive to have been that which extended along the fea coaft, and was bounded on the fouth by Mount Atlas, and other ridges. The middle one is nowr called the Country of Dates, becaufe the inhabitants chiefly live on that fruit ; and the third is the great African defert. Beyond thefe, however, Herodotus had heard of a fourth region, belonging to the negroes : for, in- another place he divides the inhabitants of Africa ge¬ nerally into two races (with the exception of ftrangers, viz. the Phoenicians and the Greeks). The natives (fays he) are the Africans and Ethiopians, one of which poffeffes the northern, and the other the fouthern part of Africa.”—By thefe nations are evidently intended the Moors and the Negroes, which two claffes are as dif- tinft at the prefent day as they were in ancient times"

He failed, accordingly, with 60 (hips of 50 oars each, and a body of men and women to the number of 30,000, and proviftons and other neceflaries.” From the extent of this plan of colonization, or rather of eftablifhing permanent garrifons, upon the w’eftern coafts of Africa, it is evident that thefe coafts muft, in fome meafure, have been previoufly examined. Major Rennel, who has inveftigated the fubjedt with great ac¬ curacy, with a reference to the journal of the voyage, is of opinion that the Carthaginian or Libyphoenician cities founded by Planno, were all fttuated to the fouth of the ftrait of Gibraltar, and to the northward of the river Senegal j and that all of them, excepting one at Cerne, now called Arguin, were placed to the north of Cape Bojador. To the fouthward of Cerne, Hanno during his voyage made two expeditions; but it does not appear that he made any attempt to fix an eftablifti- ment beyond the limits now mentioned. On his firft expedition, he feems to have failed into the river Sene¬ gal, as may be fuppofed from the defeription given j for it is faid to be “ large and broad, and full of cro- Africa, codiles and river horfes”. During the fame voyage, ' ^ Hanno made a fecond expedition louthward, apparent¬ ly for the fake of difeovery. He appears to have doubled Cape Verd, and to have failed acrofs the mouth of the Gambia. His voyage is faid to have terminated at a place which he calls the Southern Horn, fuppofed to be either at Sierraleona, or, at a little diftance to the fouth of it, at Sherbro. It is evident, from the general ftyle of the journal, that the Carthaginians, at the time of this voyage, wrere altogether unacquaint¬ ed wuth the interior ftate of the country on this wreftern quarter of Africa. Excepting the mere defeription of the coaft, and its windings and bays, every thing is marvellous, and apparently fabulous. They talk of having caught two women covered with hair, whofe {kins they brought to Carthage, meaning, in all pro¬ bability, two monkeys of fome of the unknow n fpecies which abound in the country of the Negroes. They alfo talk of ftreams of fire, and of rivers of fire which feem- ed to be running into the fea. At one place, during the night, they faw a country which w as on fire: and af¬ terwards they faw another country full of fires ; in the middle of which was a lofty fire, larger than the others, wEich feemed to touch the ftars. When day came, they difeovered this elevated fire to be a large hill, which they called the chariot of the gods. Thefe wonders have been explained to us by later travellers; who remark that it is the cuftom, at certain feefons cf the year, in the country of the Negroes, to fet fire to the dry grafs 5 and that on thefe occafions, during the night, the whole territory feems to be a ftieet of flame. Defeription With regard to Africa in general, Herodotus de-of Africa feribes it in this fummary w ay : “ All that part of by Herodo- Libya towards the northern fea (Mediterranean), from Egypt to the promontory of Soloeis (now Cape Cantin on the coaft of Morocco) which terminates the third divifion of the earth, is inhabited by the different nations of the Libyans ; that diftridt alone excepted in poffeffion of the Greeks and Phoenicians. The remoter parts of Libya beyond the fea coaft, and the people who inhabit its borders, are infefted by various beafts of prey.—The country yet more difant is a parched and immeafarable defert.'"" Here this ancient hiftorian clearly diftingunhes three belts or regions parallel to the Mediterranean, the northernmoft of which we muft conceive to have been that which extended along the fea coaft, and was bounded on the fouth by Mount Atlas, and other ridges. The middle one is nowr called the Country of Dates, becaufe the inhabitants chiefly live on that fruit ; and the third is the great African defert. Beyond thefe, however, Herodotus had heard of a fourth region, belonging to the negroes : for, in- another place he divides the inhabitants of Africa ge¬ nerally into two races (with the exception of ftrangers, viz. the Phoenicians and the Greeks). The natives (fays he) are the Africans and Ethiopians, one of which poffeffes the northern, and the other the fouthern part of Africa.”—By thefe nations are evidently intended the Moors and the Negroes, which two claffes are as dif- tinft at the prefent day as they were in ancient times"

As no ftandard could be found by which this meafure might be exa&ly determined, authors have dif¬ fered very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and of an inch ; the other one foot and of a foot ; but Mr Bruce is of opinion' that both of thefe are too large. He found, by menfuration, the Egyptian cubit to be ex¬ actly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch ; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit ufed for determining the increafe of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the minimum of increafe was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed ; but that in his time 16 or at leaft 15 cubits were neceffary to produce the fame eff-ft:. But to this account Mr Bruce obje&s, that Herodotus could have no certain information con¬ cerning the nilometer, becaufe he himfelf fays that the priefts, who alone had accefs to it, would tell him no¬ thing of the matter. Herodotus alfo informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation ; and this fuperfluous quantity Mr Bruce fuppofes to have been conveyed in¬ to the defert for the ufe of the Arabs, and that by fuch a vaft drain the rile of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminilhed. But even granting that there was fuch a difference between the rife of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Hero¬ dotus, it does not appear that anv thing like it has appeared ever lince. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 9 ] E G Y 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that Egypt; eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in v the time of Moeris. From fome paffages in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exer¬ tion of induftry to caufe this quantity of water pro¬ duce a plentiful crop ; but there is not the leaft reaion to fuppofe, that the very fame induftry was not ne¬ ceffary in the time of Moeris ; fo that ftill there is not any increafe of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian vifited Egypt, we are informed from unqueftionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the ftandard; both which accounts correfpond with that of Herodo¬ tus.

5,europe.csv,"As the influence and authority of the druids in their country, depended very much upon the reputation of their fuperior wifdom and learning, they wifely applied to the fludy of thofe fciences which moft direftly con¬ tributed to the fupport and advancement of that repu¬ tation. In this number, befides thofe already mention¬ ed, we may juftly reckon rhetoric, which was diligent¬ ly ftudied and taught by the druids of Gaul and Bri¬ tain ; who to the charms of their eloquence were in¬ debted for much of the admiration and authority which they enjoyed. They had indeed many calls and oppor¬ tunities to difplay their eloquence, and to difcover its great power and efficacy *, as when they were teach¬ ing their pupils in their fchools ; when they difcourfed in public to the people on religious and moral fubje&s ; when they pleaded caufes in the courts of juttice ; and when they harangued in the great councils of the na¬ tion, and at the heads of armies ready to engage in battle, fometimes with a view to inflame their cou¬ rage, and at other times with a defign to allay their fury, and difpofe them to make peace. Though this laft was certainly a very difficult talk among fierce and warlike nations, yet fuch was the authority and elo¬ quence of the druids, that they frequently fucceeded in it. “ They pay a great regard (fays Diodorus Si¬ culus) to their exhortations, not only in the affairs of peace, but even of war, and thefe are refpedfed both by their friends and enemies. They fometimes flep in between two hoflile armies, who are Handing with their fvvords drawn and their fpears extended, ready to en¬ gage ; and by their eloquence, as by an irrefiftible en¬ chantment, they prevent the eft'ufinn of blood, and prevail upon them to fheatb their fwords. So great are the charm« of eloquence and the power of wifdom even amongft the moft fierce barbarians.” The Britifh kings and chieftains, who were educated by the druids, were famous for their eloquence. This is evident from the many noble fpeeches which are afcribed to them by the Greek and Roman writers. For though thefe fpeeches may not be genuine, yet they are a proof that it was a well known faft, that thefe princes were ac- cuftomed to make harangues on thefe and the like oc- cafions. This we are exprefsly told by Tacitus :— “ The Britilh chieftains, before a battle, fly from rank to rank, and addrefs their men with animating fpeeches, tending to inflame their courage, increafe their hopes, and difpel their fears.” Thefe harangues were call¬ ed, in the ancient language of Britain, Brofmchty Kah, which is literally tranflated by Tacitus, Incita- menta Belli, “ incentives to Avar.” The genuine po- fterity of the ancient Britons long retained their tafte for eloquence, and their high efteem for thofe who ex¬ celled in that art. “ Orators (fays Mr Martin) were in high efieem, both in thefe illands (the ^Ebudae) and the continent, until within thefe forty years. I hey fat always among the nobles or chiefs of families in the ftreah or circle. Their houfes and little villages were fanftuaries, as well as churches, and they took place before doctors of phyfie. The orators, after the druids were extinft, were brought in to preferve the genealogy of families, and to repeat the fame at every lueceflion of a chief; and upon the occafion of mar¬ riages and births, they made epithalamiums and pane¬ gyrics, which the poet or bard pronounced. The ora- Druids, tors, by the force of their eloquence, had a poAverful \i afcendant over the greateft men in their time. For if any orator did but afk the habit, arms, horfe, or any other thing belonging to the greateft man in thefe iHands, it Avas readily granted him •, fometimes out of re I peel, and fometimea for fear of being exclaimed a- gainft by a fatire, which in thofe days Avas reckoned a great diffionour.” ^ If the Britiffi druids, confidering the times in which jyjagjc^an^ they lived, had made no contemptible proficiency in divination, feveral parts of real and ufeful learning, it cannot be denied that they Avere alfo great pretenders to fupe¬ rior knowledge in certain vain fallacious fciences, by Avhich they excited the admiration, and took advan¬ tage of the ignorance and credulity of mankind. Thefe were the fciences (if they may be fo called) of magic and divination ; by Avhich they pretended to work a kind of miracles, and exhibit aftonilhing appearances in nature ; to penetrate into the counfels of heaven \ to foretel future events, and to difcover the fuccefs or mifcarriage of public or private undertakings. Their own countrymen not only believed that the druids of Gaul and Britain were poffeffed of thefe poAvers, but they Avere celebrated on this account by the philo- fophers of Greece and Rome. “ In Britain (fays Pliny) the magic arts are cultivated with fuch aftoniffi- ing fuccefs, and fo many ceremonies, at this day, that the Britons feem to be capable of inftrufting even the Perfians themfelves in thefe arts. They prefeend to difcover the defigns and purpofes of the gods. The Eubates or Vates in particular inveftigate and difplay the moft fublime fecrets of nature j and, by aufpices and facrifices, they foretel future events.” 1 hey Avere fo famous for the iuppofed veracity of their predic¬ tions, that they Avere not only confulted on all import¬ ant occafions by their own princes and great men, but even fometimes by the Roman emperors. Nor is it very difficult to account for all this. The druids finding that the reputation of their magical and pro¬ phetical poAvers contributed not a little to the ad¬ vancement of their Avealth and influence, they endea¬ voured, no doubt, to ftrengthen and eftabliffi it by all their art and cunning. Their knoAvledge of natural philofophy and mechanics enabled them to execute fuch Avorks, and to exhibit fuch appearances, or to make the world believe that they did exhibit them, as were fufficient to gain them the chara&er of great magicians. The truth is, that nothing is more eafy than to acquire this charadler in a dark age, and a- mong an unenlightened people. When the minds of men are haunted Avith dreams of charms and enchant¬ ments, they are apt to fancy that the moft common oc¬ currences in nature are the effects of magical arts. The following ftrange ftory, which avc meet AAnth in Plu¬ tarch’s Treatife of the Ceffation of Oracles, Avas pro¬ bably occafioned by fomething of this kind. “ There « are many illands which lie fcattered about the ifle of Britain after the manner of our Sporades.

In this number, befides thofe already mention¬ ed, we may juftly reckon rhetoric, which was diligent¬ ly ftudied and taught by the druids of Gaul and Bri¬ tain ; who to the charms of their eloquence were in¬ debted for much of the admiration and authority which they enjoyed. They had indeed many calls and oppor¬ tunities to difplay their eloquence, and to difcover its great power and efficacy *, as when they were teach¬ ing their pupils in their fchools ; when they difcourfed in public to the people on religious and moral fubje&s ; when they pleaded caufes in the courts of juttice ; and when they harangued in the great councils of the na¬ tion, and at the heads of armies ready to engage in battle, fometimes with a view to inflame their cou¬ rage, and at other times with a defign to allay their fury, and difpofe them to make peace. Though this laft was certainly a very difficult talk among fierce and warlike nations, yet fuch was the authority and elo¬ quence of the druids, that they frequently fucceeded in it. “ They pay a great regard (fays Diodorus Si¬ culus) to their exhortations, not only in the affairs of peace, but even of war, and thefe are refpedfed both by their friends and enemies. They fometimes flep in between two hoflile armies, who are Handing with their fvvords drawn and their fpears extended, ready to en¬ gage ; and by their eloquence, as by an irrefiftible en¬ chantment, they prevent the eft'ufinn of blood, and prevail upon them to fheatb their fwords. So great are the charm« of eloquence and the power of wifdom even amongft the moft fierce barbarians.” The Britifh kings and chieftains, who were educated by the druids, were famous for their eloquence. This is evident from the many noble fpeeches which are afcribed to them by the Greek and Roman writers. For though thefe fpeeches may not be genuine, yet they are a proof that it was a well known faft, that thefe princes were ac- cuftomed to make harangues on thefe and the like oc- cafions. This we are exprefsly told by Tacitus :— “ The Britilh chieftains, before a battle, fly from rank to rank, and addrefs their men with animating fpeeches, tending to inflame their courage, increafe their hopes, and difpel their fears.” Thefe harangues were call¬ ed, in the ancient language of Britain, Brofmchty Kah, which is literally tranflated by Tacitus, Incita- menta Belli, “ incentives to Avar.” The genuine po- fterity of the ancient Britons long retained their tafte for eloquence, and their high efteem for thofe who ex¬ celled in that art. “ Orators (fays Mr Martin) were in high efieem, both in thefe illands (the ^Ebudae) and the continent, until within thefe forty years. I hey fat always among the nobles or chiefs of families in the ftreah or circle. Their houfes and little villages were fanftuaries, as well as churches, and they took place before doctors of phyfie. The orators, after the druids were extinft, were brought in to preferve the genealogy of families, and to repeat the fame at every lueceflion of a chief; and upon the occafion of mar¬ riages and births, they made epithalamiums and pane¬ gyrics, which the poet or bard pronounced. The ora- Druids, tors, by the force of their eloquence, had a poAverful \i afcendant over the greateft men in their time. For if any orator did but afk the habit, arms, horfe, or any other thing belonging to the greateft man in thefe iHands, it Avas readily granted him •, fometimes out of re I peel, and fometimea for fear of being exclaimed a- gainft by a fatire, which in thofe days Avas reckoned a great diffionour.” ^ If the Britiffi druids, confidering the times in which jyjagjc^an^ they lived, had made no contemptible proficiency in divination, feveral parts of real and ufeful learning, it cannot be denied that they Avere alfo great pretenders to fupe¬ rior knowledge in certain vain fallacious fciences, by Avhich they excited the admiration, and took advan¬ tage of the ignorance and credulity of mankind. Thefe were the fciences (if they may be fo called) of magic and divination ; by Avhich they pretended to work a kind of miracles, and exhibit aftonilhing appearances in nature ; to penetrate into the counfels of heaven \ to foretel future events, and to difcover the fuccefs or mifcarriage of public or private undertakings. Their own countrymen not only believed that the druids of Gaul and Britain were poffeffed of thefe poAvers, but they Avere celebrated on this account by the philo- fophers of Greece and Rome. “ In Britain (fays Pliny) the magic arts are cultivated with fuch aftoniffi- ing fuccefs, and fo many ceremonies, at this day, that the Britons feem to be capable of inftrufting even the Perfians themfelves in thefe arts. They prefeend to difcover the defigns and purpofes of the gods. The Eubates or Vates in particular inveftigate and difplay the moft fublime fecrets of nature j and, by aufpices and facrifices, they foretel future events.” 1 hey Avere fo famous for the iuppofed veracity of their predic¬ tions, that they Avere not only confulted on all import¬ ant occafions by their own princes and great men, but even fometimes by the Roman emperors. Nor is it very difficult to account for all this. The druids finding that the reputation of their magical and pro¬ phetical poAvers contributed not a little to the ad¬ vancement of their Avealth and influence, they endea¬ voured, no doubt, to ftrengthen and eftabliffi it by all their art and cunning. Their knoAvledge of natural philofophy and mechanics enabled them to execute fuch Avorks, and to exhibit fuch appearances, or to make the world believe that they did exhibit them, as were fufficient to gain them the chara&er of great magicians. The truth is, that nothing is more eafy than to acquire this charadler in a dark age, and a- mong an unenlightened people. When the minds of men are haunted Avith dreams of charms and enchant¬ ments, they are apt to fancy that the moft common oc¬ currences in nature are the effects of magical arts. The following ftrange ftory, which avc meet AAnth in Plu¬ tarch’s Treatife of the Ceffation of Oracles, Avas pro¬ bably occafioned by fomething of this kind. “ There « are many illands which lie fcattered about the ifle of Britain after the manner of our Sporades.

5,oceania.csv,"In 1675, the earl of Roehefter, whofe envious and malevolent difpofition would not permit him to fee growing merit meet with its due reward, and was therefore fincerely chagrined at the very juft applaufe with which Mr Dryden’s dramatic pieces had been re¬ ceived, wTas determined if poffible to fhake his in- tereft at court; and fucceeded fo far as to recommend iMr Crowne, an author by no means of equal merit, and at that time of an obfcure reputation, to write a malk for the court, which certainly belonged to Mr Dryden’s office as poet laureat.—Nor was this the only attack, nor indeed the moft potent one, that Mr Dry¬ den’s juftly acquired fame drew on him. For, fome years before, the duke of Buckingham, a man of not tnuCh better character than Lord Rochefter, had moft feverely ridiculed feveral of our author’s plays in his admired piece called the Rehearfal. But though the intrinfic wit which runs through that performance can¬ not even to this hour fail of exciting our laughter, yet at the fame time it ought not to be the ftandard on which we ffiould fix Mr Dryden’s poetical reputation, if we confider, that the pieces there ridiculed are not any of thofe looked on as the chef iVceuvres of this au¬ thor ; that the very paffages burlefqued are frequently, in their original places, much lefs ridiculous than when thus detached, like a rotten limb, from the body of the work ; and expofed to view with additional diftor- tions, and divefted of that connexion with the other parts, which, while preferved, gave it not only fymme- try but beauty ; and, laftly, that the various inimitable beauties, which the critic has funk in oblivion, are in¬ finitely more numerous than the deformities which he has thus induftrioufly brought forth to our more im¬ mediate infpeCtion, Mr Dryden, however, did not fuffer thefe attacks to pafs with impunity; for in 1679 there came out an Effay on Satire, faid to be written jointly by that gentleman and the earl of Mulgrave, containing fome very fevere refleftions on the earl of Rochefter and the duchefs of Portfmouth, who, it is not improbable, might be a joint inftrument in the above-mentioned kffront (hown to Mr Dryden; and in 1681 he publiffied his Abfalom and Achitophel, in which the well-known charadfer of Zimri, drawn for the duke of Bucking¬ ham, is certainly fevere enough to repay all the ridi¬ cule thrown on him by that nobleman in the charadter of Bayes.—The refentment fhown by the different peers was very different. Lord Rochefter, who was a coward as well as a man of the moft depraved morals, bafely hired three ruffians to cudgel Dryden in a coffeehoufe: but the duke of Buckingham, as we are told, in a more open manner, took the talk upon himfelf: and at the fame time prefented him with a purfe containing no very trifling fum of money : telling him, that he gave him the beating as a punifhment for his impudence, but bellowed the gold on him as a reward for his wit"
5,south_america.csv,"Dr Nicolas, a perfon of eminence in the phyfical world, and a relation of his mafter’s, happened to die. The Doctor’s books were removed to an apartment occu¬ pied by Edw’ards, who eagerly employed all his leifure hours, both in the day and great part of the night, in perufing thofe which treated of natural hiftory,' fculp- ture, painting, aftronomy, and antiquities. The reading of thefe books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile bufinefs he might have formerly had, and herefolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he vifited moft of the principal towns in Holland, and in about a month returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was difpofed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the mafter of the ffiip in which he em¬ barked.

However, by obtaining tellimonials of his innocence, a releafe was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year vifited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During his flay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each ; the firft to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720 j the fecond on foot, to Orleans and Blois; but an edidl happening at that time to be iffued for fecuring va¬ grants, in order to tranfport them to America, as the banks of the MifliiTippi wanted population j our au¬ thor narrowly efcaped a weftern voyage. On his ar¬ rival in England, Mr Edwards clofely purfued his fa¬ vourite ftudy of natural hiftory, applying himfelf to drawing and colouring fuch animals as fell under his notice. A ftrift attention to natural, more than pic- tureique beauty, claimed his e.arlieft care : birds firft engaged his particular attention ; and having pur- chaled lome of the beft pictures of thefe fubjedts, he was induced to make a few drawings of bis own j which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalift to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours. Among his firft patrons and bene- faftors may be mentioned James Theobalds, Efq. of Lambeth } a gentleman zealous for the promotion of fcience. Our artift, thus unexpectedly encouraged, in- creafed in Ikill and afliduity j and procured, by his ap¬ plication to his favourite purfuit, a decent fubfiftence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted hisin- duftry in 1731 ; when, in company with two of his re¬ lations, he made an excurfion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected feveral fcarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original pictures of feveral great maftersat Antwerp, Brufiels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the recommenda¬ tion of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart, prefident of the College of Phyficians, he was chofen librarian, and had apartments in the college. This office was peculiarly a- greeable to histafteand inclination, as he had the oppor¬ tunity of a conftant recourfe to a valuable library, fill¬ ed with fcarce and curious books on the fubjeCt of na¬ tural hiftory, which he fo affiduoufiy ftudied. By de¬ grees he became one of the moll eminent ornithologifts in this or any other country. His merit is fo well known in this refpeCt, as t« render any eulogium on his pertormances unneceflary : but it may be obf^rved, that he never trufted to others what he could perform him¬ felf ; and often found it fo difficult to give fatisfaftion to his own mind, that he frequently made three or four drawings to delineate the objeCt in its molt lively cha¬ racter, attitude, and reprefentation.

6,africa.csv,"This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable •, pro¬ ducing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bosnian, princi¬ pal factor for the Dutch at D’Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold Coast, says, “ The negro inha¬ bitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold : That they are industri¬ ously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture 5 but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here Guinea, in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence all over the Gold Coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, re¬ turning full fraught with millet, jamms, potatoes, and palm oik” The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, “ This country, as well as the Gold Coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees 5 its valleys, betwixt the lulls, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.” He adds, “ In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts 5 but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.” The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, “ was formerly so powerful and po¬ pulous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations ; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined j there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may he compared to the country of Ante just before described j frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and po¬ pulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agri¬ culture 5 some soav corn •, others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.” Smith gives much the same account of the before- mentioned parts of the Gold Coast ; and adds, “ the country about D’Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous 5 and the nearer we come towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow with¬ in the torrid zone.” Barbot also remarks*, rvith re-* spect to the countries of Ante and Adorn, “ That theDficflft soil is very good and fruitful in corn and other pro-°J duce ; which it affords in such plenty, that besides whatP'1^' serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale : they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and Avild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish ; so that nothing is Avanting for the sup¬ port of life and to make it easy.” In the Collection it is said, “ That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and sup¬ ply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine ; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as Avell by Euro¬ peans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.” These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable j not apt to shed human blood, except Avhen much provoked ; and ready to assist one ano¬ ther. In the Collection it is said, “ That the fish¬ ing business is esteemed on the Gold Coast next to tra¬ ding $ that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Kor- mantin 5 from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes, CG G U I [ a. canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread them- selves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish j a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.” Smith says, “ The country about Acra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very de¬ lightful, and the natives courteous and civil to stran¬ gers.” He adds, “ That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not un¬ common to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves. The Malay people are generally natives of Malacca, in the East Indies, situated several thousand miles from the Gold Coast.” They differ very much from the Guinea negroes, being of a tawney complexion with long black hair"

6,north_america.csv,"His care in the discharge of this office gained him the esteem of that prince in a very high degree : and though lie afterwards withdrew his public favour to Mr Hobbes on account of his writings, yet he always retained a sense of the services he had done him 51 showed him various marks of his favour after he was restored to his dominions \ and, as some say, had his picture hanging in his closet. This year also was printed in Holland, by the care of M. Sorbiere, a second and more com¬ plete edition of his book De CzW; to which are pre¬ fixed two Latin letters to the editor, the one by Mr Gassendi, the other by Father Mersenne, in commen¬ dation of it: and in 1650 was published at London a small treatise of Mr Hobbes’s, entitled Human Nature ; and another He corpore politico, or “ Of the elements qf the law.” AU this time Mr Hobbes had been digesting with great care and pains his religious, political, and moral principles, into a complete system, which he called the ^ Leviathan, and which was printed in English at Lou¬ don in 1650 and 1651. After the publication of his Leviathan he returned to England, and passed the sum¬ mer commonly at his patron the earl of Devonshire’s seat in Derbyshire, and some of his winters in town, where he had for his intimate friends some of the great¬ est men of the age. In 1660, upon the Restoration, he quitted the country, and came up to London, where he obtained from the king assurance of protection, and had an annual pension of look settled upon him out of the privy purse. Yet this did not render him en¬ tirely safe : for, in 1666, his Leviathan and his trea¬ tise He Give were censured by parliament j which alarmed him very much, as did also the bringing in of a bill into the house of commons to punish atheism and profaneness. When this storm was a little blown over,, he began to think of procuring a beautiful edition of his pieces that were in Latin $ but finding this im¬ practicable in England, be caused it to be undertaken abroad, where they were published in quarto in 1668, from the press of John Bleau. In 1669, he was vi¬ sited by Cosmo de Medicis, then prince, afterwards duke of Tuscany, who gave him ample marks of his esteem and respect; and having received his picture, and a complete collection of his writings, caused them to be reposited, the former among his curiosities, the latter in his noble library at Florence. The like visits he received from foreign ambassadors and other strangers of distinction j who were curious to see a person whose singular opinions and numerous writings had made so much noise all over Europe. In 1672, he wrote his own life in Latin verse, when, as he observes, he had completed his 84th year: and, in 1674, he published in English verse four books of Homer’s Odyssey; which was so well received, that it encouraged him to under¬ take the whole Iliad and Odyssey, which he likewise performed and published in 1675. About this time he took his leave of London, and went to spend the remainder of his days in Derbyshire : where, however, he did not remain inactive, notwithstanding his ad¬ vanced age ; hut published from time to time several pieces, to be found in the collection of his works. He died in 1679, aSe^ 92, As to his character and manners, they are thus de¬ scribed by Dr White Kennet, in his Memoirs of the Cavendish family. “ The earl of Devonshire (says he) for his whole life entertained Mr Hobbes in his family, as his old tutor rather than as his friend or confidant. He let him live under his rool in ease and plenty, and in his own way, without making use of him in any public, or so much as domestic affairs. He would frequently put off the mention of his name, and say, ‘ He was a humorist, and nobody could account for him.’ There is a tradition in the family, of the manners and customs of Mr Hobbes, somewhat obser¬ vable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to his exercise, and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore, at his first rising, he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach $ or if the weather was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, to be in a sweat: recom¬ mending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had more moisture than heat, and therefore by such IJoi.hr HOB [ 549 3 HOC ] jbes, such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture ex- bby. pelted. Alter this, he took a comfortable breakfast $ ’ ’ ' and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the children, and any consider¬ able strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He kept these rounds till about 12 o’clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he ate always by himself without ceremony. Soon af¬ ter dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle with 10 or 12 pipes of tobacco laid by him ; then shut¬ ting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and wri¬ ting for several hours. He retained a friend or two at court, and especially the lord Arlington, to protect him if occasion should require. He used to say, that it was lawful to make use of ill instruments to do our¬ selves good : * If I were cast (says he) into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to be drawn out by it.’ After the Re¬ storation, he watched all opportunities to ingratiate himself with the king and his prime ministers; and look¬ ed upon his pension to be more valuable, as an earnest of favour and protection, than upon any other account"
6,oceania.csv,"This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable •, pro¬ ducing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bosnian, princi¬ pal factor for the Dutch at D’Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold Coast, says, “ The negro inha¬ bitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold : That they are industri¬ ously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture 5 but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here Guinea, in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence all over the Gold Coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, re¬ turning full fraught with millet, jamms, potatoes, and palm oik” The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, “ This country, as well as the Gold Coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees 5 its valleys, betwixt the lulls, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jamms, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.” He adds, “ In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts 5 but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.” The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, “ was formerly so powerful and po¬ pulous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations ; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined j there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may he compared to the country of Ante just before described j frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and po¬ pulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agri¬ culture 5 some soav corn •, others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.” Smith gives much the same account of the before- mentioned parts of the Gold Coast ; and adds, “ the country about D’Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous 5 and the nearer we come towards the Slave Coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow with¬ in the torrid zone.” Barbot also remarks*, rvith re-* spect to the countries of Ante and Adorn, “ That theDficflft soil is very good and fruitful in corn and other pro-°J duce ; which it affords in such plenty, that besides whatP'1^' serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale : they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and Avild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish ; so that nothing is Avanting for the sup¬ port of life and to make it easy.” In the Collection it is said, “ That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and sup¬ ply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine ; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as Avell by Euro¬ peans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.” These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable j not apt to shed human blood, except Avhen much provoked ; and ready to assist one ano¬ ther. In the Collection it is said, “ That the fish¬ ing business is esteemed on the Gold Coast next to tra¬ ding $ that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Kor- mantin 5 from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes, CG G U I [ a. canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread them- selves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish j a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.” Smith says, “ The country about Acra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very de¬ lightful, and the natives courteous and civil to stran¬ gers.” He adds, “ That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not un¬ common to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves. The Malay people are generally natives of Malacca, in the East Indies, situated several thousand miles from the Gold Coast.” They differ very much from the Guinea negroes, being of a tawney complexion with long black hair"
6,south_america.csv,"HALLEY, Dr Edmund, an eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in 1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676, he went to the island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of those which lie near the south pole ; and having delineated a planisphere in which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in 1678. In the year 1680, he took what is called the grand tour, accompanied by his friend the celebrated Mr Nelson. In the midway be¬ tween Calais and Paris, Mr Halley had a sight of a re¬ markable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in its return from the sun. He had the Novem¬ ber before seen it in its descent; and now hastened to complete his observations upon it, in viewing it from the royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was, to settle a friendly correspond¬ ence between the two royal astronomers of Greenwich and Paris j and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a master as Cassini. From thence he went to Italy, where he spent great part of the year 1681 j but his affairs calling him home, he returned to England. In 1683, he published his Theory of the va¬ riation of the magnetical compass; in which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, vyith four magnetical poles, or points of attraction : but af¬ terwards thinking that this theory was liable to great exceptions, he procured an application to be made to King YV illiam, who appointed him commander of the Paramour pink, with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty’s settlements in America.—He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698 : but having crossed the line, his men grew sickly ; and his lieutenant mutinying, he re¬ turned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he set sail a second time in Sep¬ tember following, with the same ship, and another of less bulk, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the vast Atlantic ocean from one hemisphere to the other, as far as the ice would permit him to go ; and having made his observations at St Helena Brazil, Cape Yerd, Barbadoes, the Madeiras, the Ca¬ naries, the coast of Barbary, and many other latitudes arrived in September 1700 $ and the next year publish- 2 ed a general chart, showing at one view the variation Han of the compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as U he was now called, had been at home little more than Halm half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe'""""""""7"" the course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal head-lands in the British channel : which having executed with his usual expedition and accuracy, he published a large map of the British chan¬ nel. Soon after, the emperor of Germany resolving to make a convenient harbour for shipping in the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to view the two ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702 j passed over to Holland} and going through Germany to Vienna, he proceeded to Istria : but the Dutch opposing the design, it was laid aside } yet the emperor made him a present of a rich diamond-ring from his finger, and honoured him with a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Presently after his return, he was sent again on the same business ; when passing through Hanover, he supped with King George I. then electoral prince, and his sister the queen of Prussia. On his arrival at Vienna, he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new for¬ tifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703 } and the same year was made pro¬ fessor of geometry in the university of Oxford, in the room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by that university. He is said to have lost the professorship of astronomy in that city, because he would not profess his belief of the Christian religion. He was scarcely settled at Oxford, when he began to translate into Latin from the Arabic, Apollo¬ nius de sectione rationis ; and to restore the two books De sectione spatii of the same author, which are lost, from the account given of them by Pappus } and he published the whole work in 1706. Afterwards he had a share in preparing for the press Apollonius’s Conics} and ventured to supply the whole eighth book, the ori¬ ginal ol which is also lost. He likewise added Serenus on tlm section of the cylinder and cone, printed from the original Greek, with a Latin translation, and pub¬ lished the whole in folio. In I7I3> he was made secretary of the Royal Society} in 17 20, he was ap¬ pointed the king’s astronomer at the royal observatory at Greenwich, in the room of Mr Flamstead ; and, in 1729, was dhosen as a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He died at Greenwich in 1742"

But this difficulty arises merely from his own peculiar and paradoxical theory about the artificial origin of society; a theory which needs no refutation, but the short and luminous aphorism of Montesquieu, that “ man is born in society, and there he remains.” The other dif¬ ficulties touched upon by Rousseau, in the for¬ mer part of this quotation, are much more se¬ rious, and have never yet been removed in a manner completely satisfactory: And hence some very ingenious writers have been led to conclude, that language could not possibly have been the work of human invention. This ar¬ gument has been lately urged with much acute¬ ness and plausibility by Dr Magee of Dublin, and by M. de Bonald of Paris.1 It may, how¬ ever, be reasonably questioned, if these philoso¬ phers would not have reasoned more logically, had they contented themselves with merely af¬ firming, that the problem has not yet been solv¬ ed, without going so far as to pronounce it to n be absolutely insolvable. For my own part, when I consider its extreme difficulty, and the short space of time during which it has engaged the attention of the learned, I am more dispos¬ ed to wonder at the steps which have been al¬ ready gained in the research, than at the num¬ ber of desiderata which remain to employ the ingenuity of our successors. It is justly re¬ marked by Dr Ferguson, that, “ when language has attained to that perfection to which it ar¬ rives in the progress of society, the speculative mind, in comparing the first and the last stages of the progress, feels the same sort of amaze¬ ment with a traveller, who, after rising insen¬ sibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look down from a precipice, to the summit of which he scarcely believes he could have ascended with¬ out supernatural aid.”2 With respect to some of the difficulties point¬ ed out by Rousseau and his commentators, it may be here remarked in passing (and the ob¬ servation is equally applicable to various pas¬ sages in Mr Smith’s dissertation on the same subject), that the difficulty of explaining the theory of any of our intellectual operations af¬ fords no proof of any difficulty in applying that operation to its proper practical purpose; nor is the difficulty of explaining the metaphysical nature of any part of speech a proof, that, in its first origin, it implied any extraordinary effort of intellectual capacity.

8,oceania.csv,"His good fortune, also, not less than his great sagacity, may be remarked. Had the invention of logarithms been delayed to the end of the seventeenth century, it would have come about without effort, and would not have conferred on the author the high celebrity which Napier so justly derives from it. In another respect he has also been fortunate. Many inventions have been eclipsed or obscured by new discoveries; or they have been so altered by subsequent im¬ provements, that their original form can hardly be recognised, and, in some instances, has been entirely forgotten. This has almost always hap¬ pened to the discoveries made at an early period in the progress of science, and before their prin¬ ciples were fully unfolded. It has been quite otherwise with the invention of logarithms, which came out of the hands of the author so perfect, that it has never received but one ma¬ terial improvement,—that which it derived, as has just been said, from the ingenuity of his friend in conjunction with his own. Subsequent improvements in science, instead of offering any thing that could supplant this invention, have only enlarged the circle to which its utility extended. Logarithms have been applied to numberless purposes, which were not thought of at the time of their first construction. Even the sagacity of their author did not see the immense fertility of the principle he had dis¬ covered : he calculated his tables merely to facilitate arithmetical, and chiefly trigonome¬ trical computation; and little imagined that he was at the same time constructing a scale whereon to measure the density of the strata of the atmosphere, and the heights of moun¬ tains ; that he was actually computing the areas and the lengths of innumerable curves, and was preparing for a calculus which was yet to be discovered, many of the most refined and most valuable of its resources. Of Napier, therefore, if of any man, it may safely be pro¬ nounced, that his name will never be eclipsed by any one more conspicuous, or his invention superseded by any thing more valuable"
